Chardonnay,France,Champagne,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils,44.5,93.5,"This is an impressively rich nonvintage selection, with tropical fruit as well as a mineral-driven character. It's impressive and would certainly take more bottle aging. A blending of recent good vintages, this young-tasting Champagne is at the delicious fruit stage. It is crisp, citrus-flavored and bright with fruitiness. As it develops, the more mineral texture will come through, giving a richer, impressive wine that retains a zesty character. Ideally wait a few months after purchase before drinking."
Syrah-Grenache,US,California,Limerick Lane,48.0,93.0,"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper. Big and bold in every sense of the word, it retains just enough acidity to maintain an inviting nature and beguiling floral backbone."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Flying Goat Cellars,48.0,93.0,"Plump black plums and concentrated hibiscus fruit meet with cola, sarsaparilla and tart dried orange rind on the nose of this bottling. The palate is more earth-driven, with crushed rocks, pine needle and mint flavors spicing up the tart plum skins and berries. The texture is excitingly grippy."
Teroldego,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Foradori,48.0,93.0,"At first shy and brooding, this slowly opens up in the glass, offering aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower, licorice and flint. The palate has concentration and finesse, boasting chewy black cherry, blackberry, chopped mint, anise and mineral alongside firm acidity and lithe tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2023."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Baxter,48.0,93.0,"This shows a combination of deep fruit flavors and a firm, tight-grained texture that make it classic in style. Black cherry and black currant flavors are wonderfully accented by impressions of pine forest and dried mushrooms. Baxter matured this wine in 100% neutral French oak barrels, so the taste is all about the Langley grapes and not new oak."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Sparkman,48.0,93.0,"The sister wine to Ruby Leigh, this Cabernet-based blend is sourced principally from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens with scents of violets and moves into a firm palate mixing cassis, herb and iron shavings. Excellent structure cellaring through 2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Double Canyon,48.0,93.0,"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe."
Syrah,US,California,Foxen,48.0,93.0,"This dry-farmed vineyard reliably delivers memorable wines, including this Syrah, redolent with notes of oregano, thyme, charred beef and tar. The herbs, fruit and smoke integrate smoothly on the palate, with boysenberry fruit in the background and crushed bouquet garni on the front."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kynsi,48.0,93.0,"Deep aromas of hibiscus, rose buds, dark red berries and sugar plums are spiced up by cola, crushed pencils and lots of garrigue on this bottling. The palate is clean and crisp, with snappy raspberry, light cranberry and lots more chaparral-like herbs, including wild thyme, bay laurel, lavender and fennel pollen."
Syrah,US,California,Foxen,48.0,93.0,"Violets, bacon fat and caramel sauce are drizzled across blueberry and olallieberry fruits on the nose of this bottling from Billy Wathen and Dick Dore. The palate is expertly integrated and deep with flavors of blackberry, pepper dust, tart black-plum skins, cocoa powder and roasted pork. It conveys classic Syrah flavors, done with grace."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Smith-Madrone,48.0,93.0,"Grown on the producer's 1,800-foot-high, dry-farmed property west of St. Helena from 40-year-old vines, this is a great wine, structured and elegantly designed to highlight cassis, clove and cigar. Thick, heady tannins soften in the glass, allowing room for enviable structure and a black pepper-dotted finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Bodega de Edgar,48.0,93.0,"A blend of the favorite grapes of winemaker Edgar Torres (60% Grenache) and his wife, Erika (40% Syrah) from Kimsey Vineyard, this bottling shows bright and elegant aromas of boysenberry and elderberry with olive, wet river stone and pine forest. The chalky tannins still need time to evolve, but the black pepper, dark fruit, incense and myrrh flavors are well balanced."
Grenache,US,California,Montemar Wines,48.0,93.0,"Plenty of fresh purple flowers, from violets to lilacs, show on the nose of this bottling, as well as cola spice and a strong core of blueberry fruit. It's lightweight but well structured on the palate, where rose hips, lavender, fennel fronds and tarragon meet with boysenberry and light elderberry. This is still very fresh and young."
Zinfandel,US,California,Robert Biale,48.0,93.0,"This perennial favorite lives up to its word-of-mouth goodness, offering fistfuls of blueberry and huckleberry with a juicy length and throughput of acidity. Soft and strong, it's supple, floral and memorable in its deliciousness."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Bonny Doon,48.0,93.0,"There's a compellingly nutty warmth to the nose of this reserve blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Roussanne, with pecan and cashew aromas as well as more tart scents of key lime peels and lemon mousse. It lands heavily on the palate with roasted banana flavors and a buttery midpalate, but it is cut immediately by a kumquat tartness. Fascinating sipper."
Syrah,US,California,Foxen,48.0,93.0,"From the winery's dry-farmed vineyard comes this bottling with seamlessly integrated aromas of boysenberry, black-pepper sauce and black sesame. A tarry character kicks off the palate and then evolves into roasted lamb with lavender-pepper crust, dried mint and tarragon flavors. A soft and deftly sewn acidity hums throughout the sip."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Big Basin,48.0,93.0,"Cranberry, dried sage, sour cherry, thyme and dried chaparral shrubbery show on the nose of this wine from an oceanview vineyard near Ben Lomond. The palate is fairly lithe and bouncy with acidity, showing lots of crushed bay leaf and wild sage as well as underripe strawberry and richer cranberry notes."
Chardonnay,US,California,Tantara,48.0,93.0,"Salty lemon and ripe apple aromas combine for a very inviting nose that also shows pineapple and creamy lily scents on this bottling from a historic vineyard. A fine line of gunmetal tension runs down the middle of the palate, which opens toward a fuller-bodied wine with lots of lemon peel and butter flavors as well as a nicely chalky mouthfeel."
Syrah,US,California,Brecon Estate,48.0,93.0,"Done in the rich Paso style, this bottling shows fresh blackberry jam, crushed thyme, rosemary and vanilla on the seductive nose. The lavish palate offers espresso syrup, caramel and dense vanilla-laced blueberry. It's a great bottling for those who love a rich and decadent style."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Merry Edwards,48.0,93.0,"A blend from several of the producer's finest vineyards, including Georganne, Flax, Olivet Lane and Klopp, this offers complex notes of smoky lavender and licorice. Velvety texture underlies mouth-coating flavors of blackberry jam, pomegranate and cardamom, finishing tartly in acidity."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Cordero di Montezemolo,48.0,93.0,"Exotic spice, French oak, mature berry, menthol and a floral note are some of the aromas you'll find on this structured red. The ripe, chewy palate presents mature black cherry, raspberry compote, espresso, licorice and aromatic herb while firm fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2019–2027."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Brooks,48.0,93.0,"The delightful palate puts rhubarb pie, strawberry jam and cherry compote in play. The wine, at first broad and openly fruity, keeps building upon itself, adding hints of cured meat, smoke and chocolate. Don't quit on it before the extended finish is completely played out; it won't quit on you."
Syrah,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,48.0,93.0,"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine offers perfumed, intense aromas of boysenberry, tar, mineral, smoked meat and fresh flower. The palate boasts dense, seamless purple and black-fruit flavors that sail on the finish. It's a standout example of the variety."
Chardonnay,US,California,La Follette,48.0,93.0,"This impressively textured, focused and voluptuous wine offers well-defined flavors and aromas of honey, caramel and crisp Golden Delicious apple. Seamless and well balanced, it impresses from start to finish, with buoyant, supportive acidity at its core."
Chardonnay,US,California,Testarossa,48.0,93.0,"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate."
Syrah,US,California,Barbieri,48.0,93.0,"This bottling from a vineyard owned by the Fess Parker family is extremely gamy out of the gates, with raw lamb aromas lifted up by peppercorns and laid atop elderberry fruit. The lighter-bodied palate is framed by zesty acidity and a zippy pepper spice, with flavors of black currant and wild chaparral herbs."
Syrah,US,California,Ila,48.0,93.0,"This new project by wine bar owner Ash Mehta and winemaker Mary Bradley shows much promise, starting with woody elderberry, tar, black pepper and dense lavender on the buoyant nose. The sip starts with powerful pepper and then coalesces around cassis and black-currant fruit, a tarry minerality, dried herbs of thyme and juniper and a cocoa finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Willi Brundlmayer,48.0,93.0,"Bründlmayer, one of Austria's most famed winemakers, finds that the lyre method of training the vine gives significantly more concentration. That's certainly true of this rich, full, intense wine, with its powering acidity and flavors of almonds, white currants and cranberries."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Seebrich,48.0,93.0,"Sweet and slightly viscous in texture, this wine lacks some aromatic flourishes, sacrificing complexity for purity of its pineapple, apple and citrus flavors. Yet because of its balanced, crisp acidity, the wine still sings, finishing long and mouthwatering. Drink now–2030."
G-S-M,US,California,Big Basin,48.0,93.0,"Black and white pepper splash all over the aromas of the otherwise cherry meringue-driven nose of this blend of 39% Grenache, 33% Syrah, 26% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. It's light and airy on the palate, blending fresh strawberry fruit with a cornucopia of peppercorns. It provides a great example of how a fun, lively wine can be savorily serious as well."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Foxen,48.0,93.0,"A powerful, brooding nose of black cardamom and crushed clove melds with pomegranate and cherry, resulting in an incredibly aromatic wine that hails from a popular vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. The flavors are also quite deep—sour cherry, mocha, more clove—atop layers of bitter plum peels and refreshing acid."
Chardonnay,US,California,Barden,48.0,93.0,"There are light and airy elements of nectarine flesh and lemon blossoms on the nose of this first Chardonnay ever made by veteran Doug Margerum, who also imparts warmer scents of toast and clarified butter. The palate is tightly coiled, simultaneously soft with stone fruit and sharp with chalky texturality."
Chardonnay,US,California,Three Sticks,48.0,93.0,"Aged for a year in stainless-steel barrels, this wine is a combination of two vineyard blocks. The area planted to Old Wente 5 clone contributes zesty acidity and crisp apple; the V9 vineyard block is known for minerality. Acidity is balanced and the bouquet quite floral, with the palate devoted to brioche and golden honey."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alta Vista,48.0,93.0,"Like all of Alta Vista's single-vineyard Malbecs, this is opaque in color and ripe on the nose. Aromas of balsamic-coated raisin, black cherry and chocolate scream ripe and rich. On the palate, this is saturated, with grabby tannins. Toasty blackened flavors of blackberry and pepper narrow down on a tight tannic finish. Drink through 2024."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Sparkman,48.0,93.0,"This wine is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest equal parts Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It's aromatic and fruit-forward, offering red plum, herbs, milk chocolate and floral accents. The fruit flavors are rich and focused, showing great depth and intensity with a palate-coating feel."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Abbadia Ardenga,48.0,93.0,"Enticing aromas of woodland berry, violet, savory herb and a whiff of game lead the nose. The palate offers red berry, crushed raspberry, clove and grilled herb alongside firm but polished tannins. An anise note marks the finish. Drink 2020–2030."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,48.0,93.0,"Rounded, rich and full in the mouth, this offers swathes of flowery, aromatic fruit that is still young, still in its primary stage. With just a hint of steely texture, the wine does have structure and aging potential. For now, it is generous and delicious."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,48.0,93.0,"With the first hints of maturity on the nose, this is already a rounded and steely wine. The fruit shows as spiced apples and black currants, cut with intense citrus. But the fruit is giving way to a very precise, crisp and nervy wine that could still age further. For its best, drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Patricia Green Cellars,48.0,93.0,"Fruit from the oldest blocks in this pioneering vineyard is sourced here. It's bright, spicy and focused, with forward citrus-scented Bing cherry flavors. The concentration and length are outstanding, with just the lightest suggestion of green herbs rounding out the finish."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Ayoub,48.0,93.0,"The fruit is sourced from the Thistle and Hyland estate vineyards. It's an intense, concentrated wine, with a complex mix of mineral, lime, apple and light tropical fruit. It's textural, creamy and impressively long."
Port,Portugal,Port,Dow's,48.0,93.0,"This opulent wine is very ripe. From Dow's flagship vineyard, it is a sweeter wine than many of its kind, showing a caramel note and soft tannins. Within all of its sweet fruit is a firm, dry, structured core."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,48.0,93.0,"Rich and opulent, this is a gorgeously perfumed, sweet wine. The Eichberg vineyard produces opulent wines, and this is no exception. A touch of honey matches the intense spiciness and general sense of flamboyance. It's a ripe wine, while still structured and dense. Drink from 2017."
Tempranillo,US,California,Six Sigma Ranch,48.0,93.0,"Rustic but fascinating earthy and herbaceous aromas join rich dark fruit flavors in this voluptuous wine that's delicious now but best after 2020. It has full body, dense but melted tannins, and an array of spice, mineral and tobacco nuances that build with each sip and linger on the finish."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Anna Maria Abbona,48.0,93.0,"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, game, woodland berry and a balsamic note lead the nose. The youthful, tightly wound palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, chopped herb, clove and tobacco alongside firm, noble tannins and bright acidity. Oliver McCrum Wines and Petit Pois."
Pinot Noir,US,California,La Pitchoune,48.0,93.0,"Light, floral and brimming in exotic Asian spice, this wine offers length and breadth in an expression of elegance and balance. Orange, pomegranate and red cherry dance around a circle of rose petals, providing succulence and beauty."
Chardonnay,US,California,McIntyre Vineyards,48.0,93.0,"Ripe aromas of lemon curd, almond and butter make for a showy intro to the nose of this wine, but it is quickly focused by sharper pear and pineapple fruit. The rich palate shows all the classic Cali Chardonnay components of butter, cooked apple and crushed cashew, all expertly measured and in balance."
Chardonnay,US,California,Testarossa,48.0,93.0,"This is a dynamic wine, showing Key lime, yellow apples, oak smoke, butter, tangerine pith, macadamia nut and sea salt on the nose. The palate is streamlined with lime pith, lemon rind and seared pineapple flavors."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Elizabeth Chambers,48.0,93.0,"Elegance is a hallmark of the winery's Pinots, and even this one, registering 15% alcohol, manages to keep from tasting overblown. It's thick and rich, for sure, loaded with cherry and plum fruit, with pepper, clay, Asian spices and dark chocolate. Lazy River is one of the components of the Winemaker's Cuvée, which is a lovely comparison companion bottle."
Chardonnay,US,California,FEL,48.0,93.0,"Savory in aroma, richly fruity and accented with butter and vanilla, this wine has a complete package of flavors and an expert balance to accompany its creamy viscosity. It combines lightly toasty, earthy notes with generous pear and citrus flavors in a way that's unusual and compelling. Best after 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Domaine Divio,48.0,93.0,"Smooth as silk and soft as butter, this glides across the palate in a smoky, sexy and seductive manner. Butter and berry, black cherry and a finishing flourish of chocolate nibs, capped with espresso, give this a complete start-to-finish set of flavors. Drink now and over the next decade."
Red Blend,US,California,Jamie Slone Wines,48.0,93.0,"Focused aromas of blackberry, elderberry and black currant show on the nose of this blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Syrah and 4% Cabernet Franc, which also offers hints of leather, nettle and caramel on the nose. It's lively on the palate, with black raspberry, rose petals and violets, framed by a vibrant acidity and worthy structure."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Patricia Green Cellars,48.0,93.0,This was half whole cluster-fermented and neatly incorporates hints of earth and bark into its tart cranberry and pie cherry core. Its verticality and tannic power suggest it will age quite nicely through the late 2020s.
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Patricia Green Cellars,48.0,93.0,"There are multiple Freedom Hill selections in this winery's 2015 lineup, but the Pommard clone bottling expresses more of the site's brambly wildness along with its lusciously fruity raspberry flavors. Texture and length elevates it above much of the competition."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Patz & Hall,48.0,93.0,"Juicy and earthy, this lovely appellation wine is voluptuous with a spicy thread. Blueberry and huckleberry fruit meld seamlessly into savory bites of tree bark and forest as the whole offers length and breadth."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Buena Vista,48.0,93.0,"Juicy, fresh and lively, this is a light-bodied effort with a big presence on the palate in terms of rich mouthfeel and velvety tannin. Blueberry, cherry and a pronouncement of forest floor play well together to offer both savory and fruit-tinged sweet."
Syrah,US,California,Lorenzi Estate,48.0,93.0,"This is one of the better Temecula Valley wines in recent memory, with dried blackberry, leather, tar and condensed purple flowers on the nose. There's a kiss of herbs upfront on the palate, followed by layers of tangy boysenberry, caramel and salt and pepper flavors. The structure is apparent but not in the way, and the acidity is lively."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,48.0,93.0,"While subdued on the nose and delicate in body, this dry yet honey-slicked wine overflows with concentration and power. Pristine, ripe grapefruit and lemon flavors flood the palate, catapulted by tart tangerine acidity and earthy touches of pollen and crushed minerals. The steely finish lingers long."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,DeLille,48.0,93.0,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (58%), Cabernet Sauvignon (36%), Cabernet Franc (5%) and Petit Verdot. Vibrant aromas of cherry meats, raspberry, dried herb and barrel spice are followed by a fruit-forward flavorful palate backed by firm tannins. It has a high yum factor."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Brittan Vineyards,48.0,93.0,"The aromatics immediately capture your attention, mixing baking spices with fennel, wet rock, and ginger cake. Compact, young, fresh fruit flavors suggest pomegranate, wild raspberry and very tart cherries. This is an acid-lover's wine, with the structure to age for decades."
Port,Portugal,Port,Croft,48.0,93.0,"Wonderfully floral, this wine is rich while also having great fruits, a fresher edge and tannins that caress. From the Croft home vineyard, it shows fullness and structure. The aftertaste is so fruity and fragrant, it's almost drinkable now. Wait, though, until 2020."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Lunadoro,48.0,93.0,"As its name suggests, Tradizionale is classically crafted. Aged in large French casks, this has alluring fragrances of violet, plum and black pepper, while the palate delivers black cherry and tobacco flavors layered with carob notes. It's nicely balanced, with soft tannins and fresh acidity."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Archery Summit,48.0,93.0,"This wine is rich and expressive, with the grip and texture of a fine Chardonnay—but it's Pinot Gris. Roughly half was fermented in a concrete egg; the rest in stainless steel and one new acacia barrel. The fruit is fleshy but not fat, crisply defined with exceptional phenolic details of citrus skin. The underlying minerality further frames the ripe, tangy fruit, and the three-dimensional flavors expand and extend through a lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Black Kite,48.0,93.0,"A beautiful trio of fruit flavors—red cherry, rhubarb and raspberry—provides harmony in this vivid and pure-tasting wine. The freshness and clarity of the fruit elements is well backed by lively acidity and moderate tannins to keep it clean and appetizing from first sip to last."
Zinfandel,US,California,Scott Harvey,48.0,93.0,"This is a great example of a dry well-balanced Zin to drink with dinner rather than as a sweet dessert. It's also a taste of history, coming from a vineyard originally planted in 1869. It's medium bodied, nicely structured with firm tannins and has aromatic complexity from cedar, tobacco and cardamom notes, plus delicious just-ripe cherry flavors."
Grenache,US,California,Barbieri,48.0,93.0,"This extremely aromatic bottling shows cola, dark red cherry, black plum, nutmeg, cinnamon and concentrated hibiscus on the nose, which remains light despite all of the aromas. The acid-driven zippy wine leaps onto the palate with exotic plum and mulberry flavors, proving quite amazing in how so many flavors can ride such a light frame."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Flying Goat Cellars,48.0,93.0,"Winemaker Norm Yost racks up bundles of sagebrush, wild mint and all manner of fresh-cut chaparral on the nose of this stellar bottling, which comes from a vineyard on one of California's longest-held ranchos. The herbally driven palate mixes black and green olives with fresh raspberry juice and black pepper."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Amador Garcia,48.0,93.0,"Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity. Already a good one to ponder, but should be even better from 2009–2011. Just 750 cases made."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,48.0,93.0,"The Vineyard Select is made only on occasion. As in 2006, the cuvée includes a splash of Petit Verdot. From the extraordinary 2007 vintage, this wine has it all: depth, polish and panache. The richly fruity nose brings on the berries and cherries; they fill the palate and add layers of fig, plum, chocolate and coconut."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Joh. Jos. Prüm,48.0,93.0,"Orange rind and exotic spices lend a mysterious appeal to ripe, rich flavors of melon, mango and peach on this intoxicating, unctuous Riesling. It's sunny and sweet on the palate, but tart tangerine acidity makes it refreshingly thirst quenching."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,48.0,93.0,"Spice-edged, rounded notes of ripe Mirabelle with playful, teasing topnotes of peach beckon from the glass. This aromatic, fruitful charm also fills the palate where a bright core of lemon freshness provides verve and structure that also suggests stones and rock. Purity and clarity lets those peachy notes dance all the more. It has an exquisite, joyful, light touch with a dry finish."
Syrah,US,California,Chamisal Vineyards,48.0,93.0,"There's tremendous black-fruit density present on the first whiff of the wine, with olallieberry jam and milk chocolate dusted with clove powder, yet also a graphite-driven lightness. The palate rides the line expertly between ripeness and tartness, with fresh boysenberry flavors and dried oregano, altogether excellently spiced."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Flying Goat Cellars,48.0,93.0,"This single-vineyard bottling comes from Pinot Noir expert Norm Yost. Baking spices and cinnamon greet the nose, followed by sweet-tart boysenberry and freshly turned soil. On the palate, black licorice leads, followed by an impressively smooth, black cherry-laden midpalate, ending with tantalizing spices on the back end."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Londer,48.0,93.0,"A rich, earthy Pinot bright in red and blue fruit and an herbal note in the distance, Londer's estate-grown Pinot is a marriage of site, style and vintage. Lightly textured with soft edges and complexity to spare, it should pair well with bacon and goat cheese quiche."
Syrah,US,Washington,Sparkman,48.0,93.0,"Dark and dense, without turning fat or heavy, this excellent Ruckus captures the underlying minerality of Red Mountain grapes. There's boysenberry and black cherry fruit, black coffee and wet rock. This is built for aging."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Phillips Hill,48.0,93.0,"Bold and flavorful without feeling overtly ripe or sweet, this wine has a lot to say. It's complex and spicy, smelling of cardamom, nutmeg and rosemary—a possible result of its 25% whole-cluster fermentation. Red cherry, rhubarb and pomegranate flavors are bracing and fresh, while the texture is firm and moderately tannic. It's cellarable and will be best after 2018."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,48.0,93.0,"This is an intensely rich wine, opulent although with a sense of texture and a drier core. It's a full bodied, generous wine, fruity and structured. As a contrast, a surprising streak of fresh acidity brings an apple character to the more tropical fruit flavors. The wine should age, so drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,Iron Horse,48.0,93.0,"Steely in wet stone and high-toned citrus, this Chardonnay is from Hyde-Old Wente clones and deftly made in a light style that doesn't skimp on delicious complexity. Apple and herb figure prominently, as does a remarkable mouthfeel of minerality, a testament to the winery's cool growing sites."
Chardonnay,US,California,Stony Hill,48.0,93.0,"This producer is well respected for its long reputation of making ageworthy whites and this vintage is no exception, a bright, complex and nutty expression of pear and ginger cookie. Textured and restrained, it shows a wealth of structure and lemony acidity. Cellar it away until 2024 if you can."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Villa Oneiro,48.0,93.0,"This wine from the Palos Verdes coastline is redolent with sagebrush, crushed anise and alpine strawberries on the herbally aromatic nose. The sage also powers the palate, alongside juniper and pine, all set against a wild berry frame. This is a big Pinot, though it is relatively light in structure and happily reliant on savory herbs rather than overly ripe fruits."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,48.0,93.0,"The 10% Petit Verdot stiffens up the tannins and has a lovely violet-scented floral component that counterpoints the cassis and black cherry fruit. It's a young, tight and beautifully crafted wine that has barely come out of the barrel; it's still shut down and shy. But all the right stuff is there for a long-lived, elegant and silky wine with great breed and style."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Small and Tall,48.0,93.0,"Winemaker Joanne Duray taps the Garey Vineyard for this complex aromatic show of drying rose petals, dried cranberry, turned earth, iron, wet sage and dank mushrooms on the nose. The palate boasts a strong herbal front of oregano, thyme and marjoram, with tight cranberry fruit proving light, airy and refreshing on the palate."
Syrah,US,California,Stolpman,48.0,93.0,"Bright and zesty notes of boysenberry, cola, uncracked peppercorns and lilac show on the nose of this bottling by winemaker Sashi Moorman and grower Ruben Solorzano. Purple flowers, from lavender and violets to dark red rose petals, flavors the palate alongside tangy boysenberry fruit and black plum skins, hanging on a solid structure that will last for years. Drink 2017–2028."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Talisman,48.0,93.0,"An exuberantly juicy and fulfilling wine, this designate from a site near Lovall Valley is awash in blackberry and blueberry, showing off healthy waves of concentration and structure. Spicy cinnamon and orange peel dot the landscape before a punch of tannin and vanilla oak close out the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Limerick Lane,48.0,93.0,"Thick, rich and intensely velvety, 1910 Block is structured and surprisingly elegant, with developed acidity surrounding a taste of chocolate-covered strawberry. Leather and black pepper give it a burly robustness that complements the ripe fruit, while the tannins come off as dusty and rocky at the same time."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Couloir,48.0,93.0,"This has a classic, lighter red color and equally classic aromas of red cherry, sour cherry, black tea, lightly toasted oak and a touch of forest floor. Generous cherry and plum flavors are perfectly balanced with crisp acidity and fine-grained tannins. It's not a big wine, but a vivid, polished and memorable one."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sineann,48.0,93.0,"This vintage will be the last Resonance bottling under the Sineann label, as the vineyard has been sold to Burgundy's Louis Jadot. This delicious, ripe, detailed wine bursts with mixed red fruits. It's a lovely way to say goodbye, good luck and bon chance with the new owners. The perfectly ripened fruit is accented with toast, sandalwood and mocha as it heads into a deep, concentrated and lingering finish."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,48.0,93.0,"This is a tightly structured wine, taut with intense minerality and acidity. It has green fruit and citrus flavors filled out with toast and a creamy texture. The aftertaste, with its tangy minerality, shows the wine will age. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,August West,48.0,93.0,"Bright and peppery with spice, this bottling from Ed Kurtzman delivers all that's lovable about Pinot Noir in a fresh, light style. Its raspberry fruit is accented and lifted by bay leaf, thyme and white pepper notes, with a saline hint of kalamata olive. That boundless energy continues on the palate, where crisp pomegranate blends with marjoram."
Red Blend,US,California,Parrish Family,48.0,93.0,"This eye-opening blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Petite Sirah is dark and sexy in color, showing aromas of black cherry, sarsaparilla and black tobacco on a densely complex nose. It is soft and lush on the palate, with caramelized blueberry and black-cherry flavors, boosted by a touch of smoked meat."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Cartuxa,48.0,93.0,"This is a serious, concentrated wine that is full of generous fruit and structure. Alongside this weight, there is a lighter, juicier side from vibrant acidity. The main thrust though is concentrated tannins that are still developing. The aftertaste is dense and shows the wine needs to age. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bailarin,48.0,93.0,"This new brand from the folks behind Suacci Carciere is a study in cool-climate austerity and elegance. A tangle of savory herb and Asian spice seasons soft, lean layers of strawberry and pomegranate. Bright and full of verve, it's a food-friendly, complex wine from a producer worth watching."
Tempranillo,US,California,Baiocchi Wines,48.0,93.0,"Meaty, slightly earthy aromas are tempting, and the flavors expand with gobs of rich black plum and blackcurrant. This wine from a rising star in the Sierra Foothills has serious structure and full body, blanketed in fine tannins and encouraging the flavors to linger on the finish. Drink after 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Big Table Farm,48.0,93.0,"Among a fascinating array of low-alcohol Pinots from this producer, this is the standout. Bright, tart raspberry fruit, immaculately clean and refreshing, is backed with crystalline minerality. There's a touch of wet cement and a persistent, engaging finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,48.0,93.0,"This could be labeled Merlot, which comprises three-quarters of the Bordeaux-style blend. Big, bold, dark and intensely aromatic, it's a bit tight and tannic at first, but opens gracefully into well-layered, powerfully-structured flavors of violets and smoke, cherries and chocolate. Highlights of ground coffee and graphite extend through the finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,48.0,93.0,"Most of this wine hails from Force Majeure Vineyard, with Olsen in the Yakima Valley filling it out. Aromas of crushed granite, blackberry, wood spice and herbs are followed by vibrant red and black-fruit flavors that display depth and finesse. The finish carries."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sbragia,48.0,93.0,"With a touch of reduction from its 18-month maturation in new French oak, this wine is concentrated and youthful, still unwinding. Tangerine and peach flavors contrast with the more expected bite of apple, while moderate acidity brings freshness to the full-bodied nature of this rich, rewarding white."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Paix Sur Terre,48.0,93.0,"Sexy, luscious aromas of buttered plums and seared beef fat invite the nose on this blend of 70% Syrah and 30% Mourvèdre, which proves more delicate than brawny. Beef char and blackberry paste power the palate, but it coalesces around a focused line of licorice and graphite."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Paix Sur Terre,48.0,93.0,"Lilac and violet hang with blackberries, black plums and sweet mocha on this purple chiffon-cake scented wine  from winemaker Ryan Pease. The blend of 55% Grenache, 30% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and and 3% Counoise is full and silky on the palate, with olallieberry fruits, proving juicy but not jammy or overpowering."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Calera,48.0,93.0,"Hard cinnamon candies, cherry juice, pomegranate extract and a touch of balsamic vinegar combine for sharp, nose-tickling aromas on this organically grown wine from pioneering vintner Josh Jensen. The flavor-forward palate explodes with dark fruits, noticeable tannins and solid acidity, showing allspice, Vietnamese coffee and black tea elements."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Owen Roe,48.0,93.0,"This wine displays a fascinating aroma profile of lees, lemon and custard. There's a real sense of vibrancy and energy in its creamy texture, with lively acidity drawing out the fruit tones. The balance is spot-on with outrageous length."
Cabernet Franc,US,Oregon,Sineann,48.0,93.0,"Lovers of Cab Franc should track this wine down; it's a perfect evocation of the grape. Ripe purple plum flavors are annotated with spice and dust; the tannins are ripe and muscular; the wine sits very comfortably in the mouth. Hints of coffee grounds and tobacco liven up the finish, and the core of sweet fruit just keeps on coming."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Boekenoogen,48.0,93.0,"Dark in the glass, this bottling from deep in the Carmel Valley shows black currant, espresso, slate and dense violets on the nose. The solidly thick structure makes for a luxurious mouthfeel, a great format to enjoy prominent flavors of blueberry, blackberry, pepper, cedar and crushed coffee beans."
Chardonnay,US,California,Testarossa,48.0,93.0,"Apple cream, squeezed tangerine and a touch of popcorn make for nice, easy and yet layered aromas on the nose of this bottling by the Los Gatos-based single-vineyard-focused winery. Flavors of Gravenstein apples, browned butter and toast pop on the palate, where an intriguing flinty character pushes this into another level."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Vasco Urbano,48.0,93.0,"An unusually dark color, even for this notoriously black varietal, makes this powerful wine stand out from the first glance. Full bodied, it piles on the flavor and layers of tannic texture in a bold but pleasing way. Rich, concentrated blackberry, dark chocolate, wood smoke and baking-spice notes fill the mouth and linger on the long finish. It will be best after 2020."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Betz Family,48.0,93.0,"This wine is a blend of Grenache (33%), Counoise (24%), Syrah (20%), Cinsault (17%) and Mourvèdre. Expressive fruit-laden aromas of red plum, raspberry, blue fruit and herb are followed by plump, pure fruit flavors, with the mouthfeel only adding the appeal. It's a gorgeous interpretation of these varieties."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Rôtie Cellars,48.0,93.0,"Grenache (70%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Mourvèdre (25%) and Syrah. The aromas draw you into the glass with notes of high-toned lightly green herbs, rose hips and raspberries. The ripe red-fruit flavors display a dazzling sense of purity, drinking like a bowl of fresh fruit, with a sprinkling of herbs and spices mixed in. The balance and texture are impressive."
Chardonnay,US,California,La Follette,48.0,93.0,"Greg La Follette shows his mastery with this Chardonnay from cool Manchester Ridge. Dark gold in color, this ethereal wine is punctuated by pretty floral and citrus tones on the nose. On the palate, expect a suggestive core of lemon, guava and lingering minerality, especially through a finish that's flush with acidity."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,48.0,93.0,"The Eichberg vineyard, one of the driest in Alsace, is on a gentle southeast-facing slope. This Gewurztraminer shows the opulent style of wines that are typically produced. It is rich and generous, developing cinnamon and nutmeg flavors balanced by superripe tropical fruits. It still has a way to go, so drink from 2017."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,48.0,93.0,"This is a great example of the power that can come a Grand Cru vineyard. It's opulent and dense, but more than that it has intense energy and drive. Although the wine is marked as medium sweet, the spice and pepper give it a dry, tight, nervy edge. The wine is still young and will be best from 2017."
Syrah,US,California,Roark Wine Co.,48.0,93.0,"Though still very young, this bottling is already compelling. Black currant, black plum, fig, rosemary and game aromas arise on the concentrated nose. The layered palate offers fennel, cracked rainbow peppercorn, black currant jam and hoisin sauce flavors, cut by a vibrant acidity that penetrates into the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Big Basin,48.0,93.0,"Plump black currant, lavender extract, bright purple flowers and touches of raw beef and tar show on the nose of this bottling, made with 20% whole-cluster and 7% Viognier. Black pepper and asphalt show first on the palate, where tannins softly coat the mouth and then stand up to boost elderberry flavors. Thorough, zesty acidity ensures long cellar potential. Drink 2017–2032."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Presqu'ile,48.0,93.0,"From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria comes this exciting wine. Green and Kalamata olives show on the nose, along with crystallized cherry, juniper, fig, unripe strawberry and Mediterranean spice. It explodes with acidic life on the palate, where underripe cherry and tart strawberry flavors mix with green peppercorns, forest underbrush, wet gravel and thyme."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sojourn,48.0,93.0,"With a small percentage of whole-cluster fermentation, this is a prized, sultry and cohesive wine, nutty in aromas and a sizable pinch of oak that speaks to its youthfulness. Raspberry jam and bitter tea ride over soft waves of integrated tannin and a fierce earthiness. Drink now through 2024."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Arista,48.0,93.0,"The winery's larger offering from several vineyard sites, this wine is designed entirely to please, offering a seductively juicy abundance in black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon. Approachable and full bodied, the tannins are soft and the oak well integrated, allowing the earthy aromas and spicy brown-sugar elements to roam free."
Grenache,US,California,Beckmen,48.0,93.0,"Smoked oregano, black plum, dark berries and loamy soil notes come through on this bottling by one of this appellation's original families. Dark plum, blackberry, crushed black rocks, iron and touches of dried mint and white sage come through on the savory palate. This bottling aims more for power than finesse in this variable grape."
Chardonnay,US,California,Black Kite,48.0,93.0,"Lightly buttered popcorn aromas are cut by lime blossoms, sea salt and jasmine on this delicate while extremely fragrant nose. A laser-like acidity slices through the palate, where pan-seared apple flavors are lifted by lemon pith, mandarin orange skins and orange blossoms."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,48.0,93.0,"Lovely, lifted lemon notes are reminiscent of the purity of citrus oil, with accents of stone and smoke too. The palate of this wine is taut and fresh with a whistle-clean, streamlined drive. it offers laser-sharp acidity clad in mellowing fruit with glints of pink grapefruit and a profound, stony core."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lazy Creek,48.0,93.0,"Polished but concentrated, fruity but complex, this beautifully shaped wine is simply delicious. While fairly full-bodied, it has an elegant texture, focused black-cherry flavors, harmonious and moderate oak notes. This is so tempting to drink now, but will be best after 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Gramercy,48.0,93.0,"You can almost just smell this wine and be completely satisfied: its earth, black currant, flower, vanilla and sandalwood aromas are so intoxicating. A further venture, however, is rewarded. The dark fruit flavors are dense and full yet still fresh and lively with a finish that sails. It's a compelling example of Washington Cabernet that drinks beautifully now, but a few years (or more) in the cellar will be rewarded as well."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Spell,48.0,93.0,"This wine hangs muscular cherry and berry flavors on a big framework of firm acidity and taut tannins, ready for a long haul in the cellar or tackling a rich dish like Peking duck now. Light whiffs of spicy oak lead to tangy red cherry, raspberry and cranberry flavors. Best after 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Spell,48.0,93.0,"This wine is massively fruity and grandly structured without being heavy or overpowering, but it will need time for the firm tannins to mellow. It smells and tastes like pure, concentrated black cherry and feels full of fine-grained tannins and sour-cherry crispness. It will be best after 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Stolen Horse,48.0,93.0,"A blend of fruit from Loess and Echo Ridge vineyards, the aromas of herbs, smoke and berry provide intrigue, with smoked meat notes lurking in the background. The blueberry flavors are full and palate staining, bringing a real sense of presence and balance."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Buena Vista,48.0,93.0,"Earthy cherry and cardamom instantly attract the nose and palate of this wine, flirty and floral in classically varietal aromas of forest floor and wild truffle. Juicy acidity keeps it alive and vibrant as it opens and develops, offering a welcome twist of tangerine in the background."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,48.0,93.0,"A blend of Ciel du Cheval and Force Majeure vineyards, this wine brings a mix of pomegranate, dark raspberry, dried tobacco, crushed rock and peppery spices. It explodes on the palate with rich, dense, cranberry and spice flavors that linger."
Chardonnay,US,California,Testarossa,48.0,93.0,"Light, clean and citrusy aromas of lemon, lime and grapefruit skin meet with a dollop of white peach and dusting of crushed slate on the nose of this wine. A fine-pointed acidity carries nectarine, pluot and Asian pear flavors across the palate, which trends racy, bright and slightly sour, with a chalky structure."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Elizabeth Chambers,48.0,93.0,"Some winemakers have a special feel for Pinot Noir, and Michael Stevenson, winemaker for Elizabeth Chambers, has earned a place among those select few. Previously known as Panther Creek, the winery has been re-branded and re-imagined under the current owners. This deliberate, controlled single vineyard effort punches through with a concentrated mix of plum, rhubarb and cherry fruit, showing exceptional grip, balance and length."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Elizabeth Chambers,48.0,93.0,"Just one barrel was produced from this nine-acre site in the heart of the AVA. This is picture perfect, refined and textural, with flavors that roll from rose petals to strawberries to Bing cherries. A well-framed touch of oak (noted as neutral, yet detectable) contributes to an elongated finish that begs for the next glass. Still young and compact, this should drink its best from 2018 through 2028."
Chardonnay,US,California,Eleven Eleven,48.0,93.0,"Lemon meringue and custard provide decadence to this vineyard-designated wine, the site planted to decades-old vines. It becomes sublime as it opens, spicy and soft in quince and Asian pear. The finish returns to the opening theme, delivering a punch of caramel."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,48.0,93.0,"Taut and spicy, showing pear and savory tones, this is a slender but archetypal Grüner with a spring in its step. The palate is toned but full of verve with bundled citrus at its core. The liveliness belies the seriousness of the concentrated palate. This is a joy."
Red Blend,US,California,Three,48.0,93.0,"This full-bodied, Rhône-style blend from winemaker Matt Cline gives a blast of dark, jammy fruit flavors that are nicely concentrated and persistent on the palate and through the finish. Firm tannins match the power of the fruit, lending an appetizing grip to the otherwise rich mouthfeel."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Cottonwood Canyon,48.0,93.0,"Though lightly colored, this is a powerful Pinot Noir from the estate vineyard of Norman Beko. He cold-soaks the fruit and ferments with native yeasts to deliver aromas of raspberry, pine and wet slate. The flavors range from pomegranate to violet to red rose to a fruit punch that lingers a long time thanks to a nice acidic lift. This wine is drinking well right now, benefiting from the tertiary qualities that come from bottle age yet remaining fresh and lively. Aromas of dried red cherry, rust, sandalwood and hibiscus lead to a spice-driven palate that's bright in acidity. That rusty cherry fruit comes through in flavor, boosted by woody spice."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Tertre,47.0,93.0,"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ingrid Groiss,47.0,93.0,"The delicate smoke and hazelnut scent of oak shines through and makes a frame for ripe apricot and Mirabelle plums. The palate is soft and rounded, set off by pizzazz from the lively acidity that underlines the juicy core."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ingrid Groiss,47.0,93.0,"There is something that makes me think about a summer forest: Is it the fresh moss, the fresh green foliage, the implied ease and freshness of light green foliage on a warm day? The palate stuns with white pepper and purity and combines fruit ripeness with ballerina-like poise. Wonderful texture. Prepare to be moved."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Bordeaux,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion,47.0,93.0,"This ripe wine, from young vines, has softened its Sauvignon Blanc herbal character and developed ripe apricots and a delicious richness. The wood-aging shows, although not so as to hide the fruit and the tighter, nervy texture. Still developing, it will be best from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Monte da Capela,47.0,93.0,"Celebrating 15 years of Monte da Capela, this is a limited-release wine. The blend of Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional is rich, darkly colored and beautifully dense. Packed with still young tannins and black fruits, it is a serious wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Port,Portugal,Port,Burmester,47.0,93.0,"This year's dry conditions produced a fine crop of single quinta vintage Ports. That's perfect for the concentration in a Colheita tawny. This wine is rich, dense and with perfumed fruits that are still in evidence behind the old gold flavors of the wood aging. Drink now."
Vermentino,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Capichera,47.0,93.0,"This stunning white opens with aromas that recall white wild flower, orchard fruit and heady scents of eucalyptus and dried herb. The rich palate delivers white peach, ripe pear, wild rosemary, thyme, flinty mineral and ginger. Fresh acidity frames the juicy fruit flavors while an almond note backs up the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carlisle,47.0,93.0,"From the mighty site, this is a mountainous wine, generous and layered with bold big flavor. Plum candy, cinnamon, nutmeg, licorice and raspberry swirl in the glass with tension and grace, finishing in a wrapping of firm oak and tannin."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Malat,47.0,93.0,"The fleshy ripeness of yellow pear plays on the nose but the palate adds gorgeous herbal spice to the proceedings. It is like very ripe pear and yellow plum were bedded on yarrow, thyme and white pepper. All this is held together by gentle rounded lemon freshness and results in a totally, balanced, appetizing, moreish wine with an clean finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Waits-Mast,47.0,93.0,"This distinctive wine has a light-garnet color and intriguing raspberry and cranberry aromas that lead to full red- and black-cherry flavors accented by rosemary and wood smoke. Fermented by native yeast and using some whole clusters for the astringency and flavor that stems can add, it has a texture that's moderately tannic and nicely supported by acidity."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine des Remizières,47.0,93.0,"One of the finest Crozes-Hermitage wines I can remember tasting, this wine combines mouthwatering notes of hickory-smoked pork and dark berries. There's plenty of richness on the midpalate and a long, velvety finish, making this truly a complete package. Drink now–2030."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Thermenregion,Heinrich Hartl,47.0,93.0,"An earthy, oakleaf note signals a true expression of Pinot Noir. There is something sleek, fluid and authentic about this. The wine accents cherry and forest berry as much as the autumnal notions of spice, fallen leaves and earth. It's elegant and honest, with a firm yet relenting structure and lasting flavors."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Malat,47.0,93.0,"Hints of soy and pepper color the generously ripe notions of yellow pear and red apple on the nose. The palate reinforces the spiciness with more shimmering white pepper and the ripeness with extra juiciness. This is rounded but fresh, and just so full of sunny friendly fruit. The appetizing and moreish finish returns to that initial soy-like spice."
Sémillon,Australia,New South Wales,Tyrrell's,47.0,93.0,"From a single vineyard planted in 1908, this Semillon is just entering its window of drinkability, where it should remain for at least another 10 years. Scents of fresh lime juice and grilled toast lead the way, backed by flavors of limes and mandarin oranges. It's medium in body, plump yet tightly focused, with a lengthy finish full of toast and citrus zest."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,O. Fournier,47.0,93.0,"Brilliantly colored, with dynamite concentration and lovely black fruit and earthy aromas. Precise on the palate but also big and muscular, with silky tannins, grip and a late rush of deftly applied French oak. Delicious and a fine reflection of the Uco Valley, Argentina's top Malbec region."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,47.0,93.0,"There is an aromatic, herbal lift among the full-fruited nose of this wine that is reminiscent of freshly peeled curls of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples. The palate adds a pleasantly bitter, slightly phenolic edge that gives texture and and counterbalance to the soaring freshness of the citrus and apple notes. Concentration and power come in a compact, taut package that is likely to unfold a little more with bottle age. It finishes with the rich and honest flavor of crisp, ripe apples. Compelling now but it will be even better. Drink 2017–2030."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carlisle,47.0,93.0,"From a ranch planted originally in 1926 this is a knockout wine, exotically spiced and nuanced in pepper, cinnamon and a distinction of sandalwood. High-toned fruit provides a lift to the lushness that wants to dominate, but never does, allowing the tangy orange and blackberry to speak quietly and clearly."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carlisle,46.0,93.0,"From the gorgeous, mighty Pagani, planted in 1895, comes this powerfully rich and refined wine, a study in woodsy rusticity and layers of fig, blackberry and a stick of cinnamon. Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Genium Celler,46.0,93.0,"This village-designated Priorat is dry, spicy and fresh on the nose, with notes of mountain herbs as well as lively raspberry, plum and currant. It feels wide and packed with power and purity. Roasted berry, oak spice, earth notes and rooty sweetness define the flavor profile on this long-finishing wine with hard tannins and strong aging potential. Best from 2017 through 2024; only 100 cases made."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Scar of the Sea,46.0,93.0,"Though this is their appellation blend, Mikey Giugni and Michael Brughelli don't hold back, offering elegant aromas of rose petals, purple flowers, rich pomegranate fruit, rusty strawberries and light vanilla on the nose. The palate begins with a light cranberry-raspberry flavor that deepens into tart mulberry before showing dried rose petals, uncrushed clove and a lava-rock minerality."
Syrah,US,California,Foxen,46.0,93.0,"Dark boysenberry, dried lilac and the slightest touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling, one of the first that Foxen has labeled with the new Los Olivos District appellation. Tart plum skins and elderberry show on the sip that is structured by solidly dry tannins accented by flavors of lavender and thyme."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière,46.0,93.0,"A portion of this estate is in the cru appellation of La Londe, based on schist soil. This single-vineyard wine is impressive in its ripe fruit and vein of fresh acidity. It is full bodied and concentrated, while keeping a light touch. It is dry, lightly structured and likely will be even better from the end of 2016."
G-S-M,US,California,Alta Colina,46.0,93.0,"Heady, gamy and thick notes of lanolin, blood, lamb, smoked wood, roasted fennel, pencil lead and peppercorn rise into intriguing coriander and cumin notes on the nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre. Those exotic spice notes carry to the palate, where a medium acidity and clean tannic structure present black peppercorn and cardamom notes atop a boysenberry backdrop."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,Antonio Caggiano,46.0,93.0,"Enticing scents of blue flower, woodland berry, moist earth and chopped herb lift out of the glass. The elegant palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry, star anise and cinnamon set against a backbone of firm but refined tannins. It's impeccably balanced, with bright acidity. Hold for even more complexity and to let the tannins unwind. Drink 2020–2033."
Merlot,US,California,Barrack,46.0,93.0,"Elegantly woven aromas of cassis, sandalwood and truffle show on the nose of this wine, which also includes 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 3% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. The palate also combines that plummy fruit with woody spice, showing cedar and crushed pepper, creating a savory experience that makes the mouth water into the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Heintz,46.0,93.0,"From the Heintz Vineyard, well-known for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, comes this compelling Syrah. A burst of toasted oak and dry tannins upon entry develops slowly into a taste of ripe, black fruit, black olives and tar. Surrounded by a soft palate the wine is also marked by a starkness of black pepper and hint of lavender."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Joseph Jewell,46.0,93.0,"From a cool Forestville vineyard once devoted to apples, Appian Way is rich in Goldridge soils, providing a happy home to these grapes that offer a core of pomegranate and cranberry, laced in black tea. Light bodied without being wimpy, the wine is complex and velvety, finishing in nutmeg and ginger."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Claiborne & Churchill,46.0,93.0,"A lush and expressive bottling from a brand new vineyard, this shows candied black cherry, Vietnamese coffee, baking spice and licorice on the approachable nose. The ripeness extends to the palate, hemmed in by a tannic structure that ensures long aging. Asian pepper, rum barrel, caramel and cherry flavors complete the picture."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,46.0,93.0,"Slightly funky notions appear first: There's a hint of reduction but this, thankfully, blows off. Underneath sits a very sprightly, very fresh wine that pits fruity apple mellowness against total, dry freshness. This has a concentrated core, the aromas are still a little tinged by the flinty, smoky hints of reduction but this will stand them in good stead for cellar age. Give this some time. Drink 2020–2030."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Kumeu,Kumeu River,46.0,93.0,"Usually the bigger, more opulent of the Kumeu River Chardonnays, the 2015 version of the Coddington is medium to full in weight, but strikingly focused and vibrant. Bacony smoke notes frame white peach flavors, finishing long."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,William Fèvre,46.0,93.0,"This is a wine that speaks of its terroir, the chalk soil coming out in a very mineral, austere character. It has elegance, class, great style of poise, showing acidity, fresh green fruits and a need to age for at least 5 years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Stolo,46.0,93.0,"Cherry pie aromas kick off the nose of this bottling from a steep hilllside site behind Cambria. Clove, nutmeg and maple-cured bacon notes follow. Blackberry, vanilla and clove flavors glide on the palate, which offers ample tannins and acidity for cellaring, although the wine is delicious now."
G-S-M,US,California,Dilecta,46.0,93.0,"Baked plum, smoked pork, red currant and fresh oregano show on the clean nose of this blend of 53% Grenache, 31% Syrah and 16% Mourvèdre. Baked strawberry, boysenberry and red currant show on the palate at first, but it quickly evolves into dried flowers and extra spicy vanilla, all framed by a tarry tension and biting acidity."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Boekenoogen,46.0,93.0,"Deep and dark in the glass, this bottling from a family-owned winery shows aromas of cola spice, wild cherry, cocoa dust and game. On the palate, rich black-cherry fruit is expertly cut by accents of dried sagebrush and licorice. Persistent, bountiful acidity carries it to a black raspberry-inflected finish."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette,46.0,93.0,"A perfumed, red-fruited wine, packed with tannins and huge, concentrated fruit. It has richness, dark structure and an intensity that promises a long future. The balance is not there yet, so wait at least 7–8 years."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette,46.0,93.0,"Wood and fruit tannins push through strongly in this powerful wine. It has weight and plush fruit texture, and behind the tannins, dark chocolate and licorice flavors. It's dense and concentrated, needing several years, at least 5–6, to shine."
Pinot Noir,US,California,El Lugar,46.0,93.0,"Longtime Claiborne & Churchill winemaker Coby Parker-Garcia releases his own project with exemplary results. This bottling shows aromas of cherry leather with dried sage, black slate, Earl Grey tea and elderflower. There's amazing herbal and floral intricacy to the palate, with concentrated cranberry skins, lavender and purple fruit flavors."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,46.0,93.0,"Rich aromas of juicy peach and Damask rose have the lovely and tempering edge of grapefruit zest. The palate gives us the same welcomed counterpoint of zesty aromatic freshness and perfumed opulence. This has lovely fluid freshness, couched in sumptuous flavors. This is exquisitely balanced and finishes just about still dry."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bruliam,46.0,93.0,"Hearty sagebrush, rust and dust meet with dried Montgomery cherry and tart pomegranate aromas on the nose of this bottling from a Healdsburg-based producer. It's luscious on the palate with ripe plum fruit and tons of baking spice, from cinnamon to clove cream, nutmeg and vanilla."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Rideau,46.0,93.0,"From one of the more popular vineyards in the appellation, this bottling shows strawberry fruit, allspice, black pepper, candied cherry and cinnamon on the nose. A strong sizzle of acidity marks the sip, with intriguingly deep raspberry, tangy cranberry, white pepper and crushed-slate flavors. Though light in body, it is heavy in flavors."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Enticer,46.0,93.0,"This bottling is the work of Jaffurs general manager David Yates, and the 2014 shines as a great example of blending wines of varying degrees of ripeness. The nose shows thyme, olive, cranberry and fennel, with a warmer hint of vanilla. The palate offers intriguing mulberry and red plum fruit, with exotic notes ranging from sichuan peppercorn to preserved lemon to kalamata olive."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Jaffurs,46.0,93.0,"Concentrated olallieberry and black plum meld with leather and lilac scents on the nose of this blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 33% Grenache and 17% Syrah. Round and ripe blueberry, black currant and kirsch-like fruits show on the palate, but floral aspects, grippy texture, peppery spice and vibrant acidity take it to the next level."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Billaud-Simon,46.0,93.0,"Produced from a 7-acre parcel within the premier cru, this wine is tight and nervy at this young stage. It has acidity, a tangy mineral texture and crisp white and citrus fruit but needs time to fill out and show its full potential. Drink from 2021."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bruliam,46.0,93.0,"Earthy and just the slightest touch reduced, this is a feral, juicy and intriguing wine from the well-known site, complex and medium to almost light-bodied in texture and approach. Cherry and pomegranate compote meet cardamom baking spices to suggest warmth and comfort in a glass."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Aequorea,46.0,93.0,"This spicy wine from grapes grown above the coastal hamlet of Cambria offers expertly integrated aromas of black cardamom, chai spice, root beer, black raspberry and roasted game. There are dense fruits on the palate, nearing boysenberry and blackberry, along with a plum-skin sourness and a black-sage spice"
Pinot Noir,US,California,Boekenoogen,46.0,93.0,"Dried strawberries, saddle leather, crushed violets and a hint of maple make for a fairly straightforward yet appealing nose on this wine. Pomegranate, raspberries and purple florals show on the palate, but the tannic structure still is a bit wound up, and will unfold into more anise and sage in years to come. Drink 2018–2024."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Zepaltas,46.0,93.0,"This light, clear wine is varietal in approach and silky texture, also offering a tension of high acidity, forest floor and nervy, cool-climate fruit. From a vineyard overlooking Freestone, it speaks to site and taste with classy effectiveness."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Couloir,46.0,93.0,"Another lovely Monument Tree Pinot from Couloir, this vintage is stemmy and earthy, yet soft, silky and voluptuous in all the right ways. It's pleasantly refined and ethereal, with whispers of cherry and raspberry fruitiness alongside equal parts gravitas and substance."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Ryan Cochrane,46.0,93.0,"Candied red fruits of raspberry and pomegranate meet with rhubarb pie, sweet thyme and ripe tomato on the nose of this bottling by a San Francisco accountant-turned-vintner. It's supple and soft on the palate, with more tomato flavors as well as fennel pollen and tarragon."
Pinot Noir,US,California,El Lugar,46.0,93.0,"Fresh aromas of carnation, framboise, cherry cola and blooming rose petals show on the nose of this bottling by Coby Parker-Garcia. Bright flavors of hibiscus tea, pomegranate and raspberry ride a clean line of crushed thyme and peppercorn dust on the lively palate."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Hug,46.0,93.0,"This is a head-turning Pinot Noir due to its darkness and depth. An intense crushed slate and loamy soil minerality dominates the nose, like serving pepper-dusted blackberry pie in a dark cave. A low-simmering acidity powers the almost Syrah-like sip, where boysenberry and elderberry meet with a roasted meat quality."
Syrah,US,California,Barbieri,46.0,93.0,"Extreme black-pepper spice meets with cola, violet, wet asphalt, forest floor and very tight elderberry fruit on the nose of this wine by Rome-raised somm-turned-winemaker Paolo Barbieri. The pepper drives the palate along with dried oregano, thyme, dill and marjoram against a boysenberry fruit frame."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Flying Goat Cellars,46.0,93.0,"This aggressive, spice-laden, clone-focused bottling from Norm Yost shows crushed kola nut, clove, black cherry, turned earth and touch of pine forest on the nose. Dried mint and eucalyptus flavors lead the sip, which settles into dark red fruits and heavier brown spice, with plenty of acidity and crushed rock minerality."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Domaine de Suremain,46.0,93.0,"This is a perfumed wine, opulent and with a fine smoky structure. With great ripe berry and red-currant fruit, the wine has a juicy character, bright and crisp with acidity while also solidly textured. Drink this wine from 2023."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,El Nido,46.0,93.0,"Oddly, this is preferable to El Nido's $140 Cab-heavy fruit bomb. Maybe that's because Monastrell is the go-to grape in Jumilla, and this is 70% Monastrell and only 30% Cab compared to the opposite with El Nido. All that said, this wine is ripe, approachable and dark, with excellent balance and a fudgy, warm finish of fruitcake and blackberry. Drink now through 2013."
Pinot Noir,South Africa,Hemel en Aarde,Hamilton Russell,46.0,93.0,"This opens with attractive earthy aromas of forest floor, cola, vanilla bean and toasted spice, grounded in a core of red currant, cherry and raspberry fruit. The medium-weight mouthfeel is lush and seductive, with fine yet structured tannins that result in a satiny texture. Pure fruit flavors dominate the palate, but the finish is layered with notes of white pepper, tea leaf and woody spice. Approachable now, but will age well through 2020."
Syrah,US,California,Limerick Lane,45.0,93.0,"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Dunham,45.0,93.0,"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak—it's aged in 70% French and 30% American. The wood is dominant, which is not surprising in a wine built for long term aging. Given plenty of time to breathe, bright red fruits, citrusy acids and a lovely mix of toast, caramel and clove accents emerge."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Pez,45.0,93.0,"With layers of wood, this is a structured wine, driven as much by tannins as fruit. It will need time for the dark plum fruit flavors to come through—St.-Estèphe is always likely to be firmly textured."
Zinfandel,US,California,Valdez,45.0,93.0,"This classic site provides a grippy, structured experience of juicy, leathery blackberry and black pepper. The wine also reveals a brighter, more vibrant underside of red berry, perhaps from the contribution of 5% Grenache into the mix, alongside 17% Petite Sirah. Firm, focused and full bodied, this is a delicious wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Barons,45.0,93.0,"Founded by a well-heeled group of wine afficionadoes, Barons has seen a change of ownership and a change in winemaking direction. For the first time, French oak has begun to supplant American oak as the barrels of choice. The wine is aromatic, detailed and inviting, with the lower alcohol prevalent in 2011. A rich mix of berry and cassis dives deeply into the palate, with dark chocolate highlights. The tannins are silky and polished, and the wine seems a sure bet to cellar well until the mid-2020's."
Zinfandel,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,45.0,93.0,"Smoky in dark clove and black pepper, this is a smooth, bright Zinfandel from head-trained, dry-farmed vines planted in the 19th century. After skipping the 2011 vintage, the winery returns with this stunner, brambly in succulent blackberry with plenty of intriguing spice."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,René Muré,45.0,93.0,"Clos Saint Landelin is a portion of the Vorbourg Grand Cru vineyard wholly owned by Muré. This rich wine is comfortably excessive, very full of spice and lychee flavors. Medium dry in character with a dry core, it is still young and could age. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Au Bon Climat,45.0,93.0,"Ripe raspberry jam scents gain intrigue thanks to hints of eucalyptus oil, orange rinds and iron on this Jim Clendenen-made wine. The palate is driven by dried herbs, from oregano to thyme, with cooked pork rind meatiness in the middle and a vanilla-flecked finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Center of Effort,45.0,93.0,"This is a rich, dense Pinot, with blackberries, sweet cloves, allspice, gingerbread and nutmeg aromas. The palate carries the tune, with dark raspberry, dried strawberry, cranberry sauce and black cherry notes all heavily seasoned by cardamom, pine sap, eucalyptus and sea salt."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Les Belles Collines,45.0,93.0,"Beautiful aromas of rose and lavender open this wine, followed by intense mushroom, truffle and earth. Bright in acidity, a wild strawberry flavor sharpens the focus as soft, well-integrated tannins and subtle oak intermingle. The entire package finishes with a bang of crisp red-cherry fruit."
Syrah,US,Washington,W.T. Vintners,45.0,93.0,"Les Collines is one of the most exciting Syrah vineyards in the state and this wine, which all comes from Block 30 and saw only neutral barrels, expresses this site exquisitely. It opens with aromas of violets, rubbed herb, smoked meat and purple fruit. The palate brings a mesmerizing sense of purity, with mouth-coating seamless fruit and savory flavors. It drinks well on its own but is really designed for the dinner table."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Talisman,45.0,93.0,"This is the producer's first release from this site. It succeeds wildly with its juicy, tart flavors of cranberry and red cherry that become fleshy and concentrated on the palate. Complex and delicious, it finishes with a thickness of toast and black tea."
Chardonnay,US,California,Black Kite,45.0,93.0,"A brand-new offering from this producer that usually traffics in Anderson Valley Pinot Noir from its own estate, this initial attempt at a white wine is stunning, a well-honed marriage between site and winemaker. Thick and expansive on the palate, it's a complex study in succulent apple and ginger, with a mineral-laden finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Cadence,45.0,93.0,"This wine is 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically brooding, with notes of high-toned dried herbs and dark cherries. The flavors are textured and palate-coating, with firm tannins backing them up. Just a baby now, it has a long life in front of it. Enjoy after 2021."
Chardonnay,US,California,Brick & Mortar,45.0,93.0,"This is a beautiful and beguiling wine, so different from many of its counterparts in its sizzling, citrus-driven acidity and persistent freshness. Tangerine and grapefruit are the stars, unexpectedly keeping this light-bodied vineyard-designate alive and inviting on the palate."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Conceito Vinhos,45.0,93.0,"Rich, generous and packed with fruit, this is a field-blend wine that just bursts from the glass. With a fine balance between tannins and the rich blackberry fruits, the wine is ripe, warm and structured. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Keller,45.0,93.0,"This is a wildly exotic wine, vibrantly abuzz in cranberry, pomegranate and rhubarb, a side note of barnyard-like earth and pretty rose petal. Tight-grained acidity remains firm in the glass and supportive of a grittiness of texture, notes of clove and black tea spiked throughout."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Bonny Doon,45.0,93.0,"The blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 16% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsaut offers subtle mulberry fruit on the nose, a spicy peppercorn kick and plenty of gamy meats. That funky meat quality, from raw to jerkied, is prominent and pure on the sip, surrounded by exotic plums and Middle Eastern spices."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Riscal,45.0,93.0,"Earthy, leathery aromas of baked red fruits fit the classic style. This is full on the palate but not heavy, with cola, molasses, coffee and heady raspberry and plum flavors. A warm finish with fine tannins and ripe flavors of chocolate, lightly baked black fruits and vanilla. Drink 2015–2025."
St. Laurent,Austria,Burgenland,Tinhof,45.0,93.0,"Crunchy red cherry and stone, the merest hint of vanilla and a densely-packed but toned texture of bundled, fine tannins make for a compact wine. This is too young to show its true colours now and will take time to relax into itself and unfold St Laurent's cherry charm. Right now, everything is tightly grasped and coiled. Drink 2017–2025."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Clos du Marquis,45.0,93.0,"Already well balanced, this firm, concentrated wine allows its fruit to show strongly. Dominated by juicy, black-currant-flavored Cabernet Sauvignon, it is solid while also fresh, layering tannins and acidity. The wine will develop quickly; drink from 2020."
Zibibbo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Donnafugata,45.0,93.0,"Made with 100% dried Zibibbo grapes, this generous dessert wine offers aromas of fresh apricot, lemon jam, sweet spice and whiff of eucalyptus. The enveloping palate doles out mature yellow peach, candied date and a touch of cinnamon while bright acidity lends freshness and balance."
Syrah,US,Washington,Saviah,45.0,93.0,"Funk Estate (60%) and Watermill vineyards—both in The Rocks District—make up this wine. It's initially aromatically brooding with high-toned notes of stems, green herbs, coffee, funk and mineral, with generous floral notes providing accents. The palate is rounded and full, with fruit and savory flavors intertwining, showing a very pretty precision. The finish is lengthy."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,McCall,45.0,93.0,"While 16 months in French barriques lends roundness of mouthfeel, there's hardly any oak embellishment here. Instead, this wine offers a showcase of perfumed, concentrated black cherry and berry that shines through. It's rich and mouthfilling, yet impeccably structured, with a long, delicately tannic finish."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Terrazze dell'Etna,45.0,93.0,"Showing elegance and structure, this opens with aromas of underbrush, earth, leather, herb and a balsamic note. On the vibrant palate firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity frame dried cherry, mocha, licorice and exotic spice. Candied orange zest and a mineral note close the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Bella,45.0,93.0,"This bodacious but balanced wine from a wild corner of Sonoma County has smoke and black pepper aromas, rich grape, boysenberry and roast beef flavors, very bracing tannins and full body. It's big, yes, but it also gives up nuances that make it complex and compelling. Best to drink after 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Laporte,45.0,93.0,"The idea that Sauvignon Blanc cannot age is emphatically disproved by this impressive, mature wine. It is rich and concentrated, full of almonds, herbs and a great sense of length and ripeness. This is now perfectly ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Rodney Strong,45.0,93.0,"Compost, earth and spicy cardamom notes provide the savory intrigue of this full-bodied, expressive wine, with additional pine forest, pomegranate and orange peel flavors that add to its complexity and appeal. Sourced from several vineyards in the heart of the appellation, it represents the vintage and the location well."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Fontanafredda,45.0,93.0,"Rose, violet, red berry, cake spice and aniseed are some of the aromas you'll find on this delicious Barolo. On the balanced palate, notes of tobacco, licorice, clove and dried herb accent the juicy cherry-berry core. Ripe, firm tannins and fresh acidity provide structure."
Pinot Noir,US,California,JCR,45.0,93.0,"The wines from this remote ranch off of Jalama Road combine mossy forest-floor touches with dark hearty aromas, in this case showing pine, rust, juniper, thyme and purple fruit on the nose. The texture is grippy, and there is cranberry fruit in the background, but the palate's attention turns mostly to eucalyptus, dark spice and even tobacco toward the finish."
Grenache,US,Washington,Maison Bleue,45.0,93.0,"All of the fruit for this wine comes from Monette's Vineyard in the Rocks District, and it was fermented using 75% whole clusters. The aromas are fresh and perfumed, recalling red raspberry, pipe tobacco, white pepper, pomegranate, kirsch, herb and orange peel. The palate shows mesmerizing purity in its red fruit flavors, which are backed by fine-grained tannins. A thoroughly delicious interpretation of the variety that is nothing short of dazzling."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot,45.0,93.0,"This young, textured wine shows a mix of strong minerality and ripe white fruits. The Albert Bichot Chablis domaine has a fine parcel from this premier cru. Refreshing citrus and tight acidity contrast with the warmer vanilla and yellow fruits. Drink from 2021."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,45.0,93.0,"Blossomy and fresh with apple and pear aromas, this sprightly wine seems to flit and quiver on the palate with its piercing grapefruit acidity. Fresh and fruity with hints of quince jelly and lemon candy, it finishes long with a gorgeously honeyed, floral finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Sattlerhof,45.0,93.0,"Regarded as a Styrian Grand Cru, the Kranachberg produces landmark Sauvignon Blanc. In the hands of Wilhelm Sattler, the richness of the fruit, with its almost tropical spice element, is tinged with elegance as well as great concentration. There is a fresh, racy aftertaste."
Syrah,US,Washington,Dusted Valley,45.0,93.0,"There's a streak of citrus running down the spine. The lively acidity adds some zip to the blackberry and black cherry fruit. There's a smoky edge to the polished tannins, but those lemony acids keep the wine bright and fresh, penetrating into a lingering finish with sweet cracker and pepper highlights."
Syrah,US,California,Sinor-LaVallee,45.0,93.0,"Mike Sinor is taking his fans on an experimental ride through his new oceanview vineyard, here presenting a rich take on Syrah. It's lush on the nose with olallieberry and blackberry fruit as well as rich bacon fat, vanilla bean and milkchocolate notes. Concentrated black cherry thrives on the palate alongside caramel and vanilla cream."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sante Arcangeli,45.0,93.0,"Light in color but bursting with aromas of candied cherry, pencil lead, sauteed porcini mushrooms and rain-soaked gravel, this is a fabulous wine from an oceanview vineyard above Corralitos. Italian spices of oregano and bay leaf combine with a sesame-oil warmth and bright raspberry fruit on the zesty palate."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rock Wall,45.0,93.0,"This is a beautiful wine, fully expressive of the vineyard and vintage. It's showy in juicy red and black wild berries, with just-right additions of cinnamon and black pepper. Full bodied and concentrated, it remains approachable and an ideal companion to meaty fare."
Muscat,France,Alsace,Domaine Schoffit,45.0,93.0,There is just a faint touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The palate follows with creamy floral peach notes on an incredibly light-bodied fluid palate of great intensity and stony depth. It is only on the aftertaste that the full volume and power of these aromatics shine. This feels like the aromatic heart of Alsace itself.
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Carlisle,45.0,93.0,"A forest-like earthiness mingles with yeasty baked bread aromas in this soft, well-built Mourvèdre- and Petite Sirah-dominant field blend. Fig, black pepper and tar flavors show through a tightly knit foundation of powerful tannin and texture, seasoned with Asian spice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Six Sigma Ranch,45.0,93.0,"One of the top wines from Lake County, this is imposing, dense and concentrated, tasting young but very promising. It smells like black cherries and toasted oak and tastes at once rich and restrained. Dark chocolate, blueberry and cardamom flavors are wrapped in a blanket of fine-grained tannins. This is sure to improve with time; best after 2022."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Áster,45.0,93.0,"Pure berry and plum aromas are nuanced by notes of tobacco, cedar and spice. This wine is tight and rock solid on the palate, with laser-like focus. Flavors of plum, blackberry and toasty oak finish woody, smoky and resiny. Best from 2016 through 2023."
Picolit,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Comelli,45.0,93.0,"This beautiful, balanced dessert wine opens with heady aromas of acacia flower, honey, alpine herb and dried apricot. The concentrated palate offers mature yellow peach, lemon zest, dried herb and candied ginger alongside bright acidity that makes this so drinkable. It's polished and delicious."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,kukkula,45.0,93.0,"This blend of 52% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 23% Mourvèdre is quite sultry on the nose, with crushed boysenberry, dried violets, wet clay and the slightest touch of soy. Pepper and moist earth arise on the palate, alongside blackberry and blueberry fruit, a touch of cocoa and concentrated lavender and other purple-flower flavors."
Merlot,US,Washington,Substance,45.0,93.0,"There's no question about the variety, with its jazzy aromas of raspberries, blackberries and graphite that lead to plump plush layered fruit flavors. It brings an unabashed sense of deliciousness, with a finish that won't quit."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,K Vintners,45.0,93.0,"Pale to the point of being Pinot-esque, this wine draws you in with its aromas of earth, cigar box, crushed flowers, herb and sour cherry. The palate is ethereally light and elegant, fully of savory flavors and made in a transparent style. It might be too elegant for some tastes but others will swoon."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,45.0,93.0,"This single-vineyard blend's flavors run through all the berries right into dense cassis. It gathers more strength as it rolls through the midpalate, layering in earth and black cherries, with char and toast more noticeable than in the other Tamarack reds."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Wolfberger,45.0,93.0,"The scent of fresh fragrant orange peel has a totally honeyed edge on the nose. The palate, however, has a wonderfully clear and clean-cut green pear and lemon note that simply sings. There is concentration and poise but also a feeling that this might be far better with a few years of cellar age. The beautifully dry palate is concentrated and has impact but is not heavy; the finish is lip-smacking and vivid. It's lovely now but better later. Drink 2017–2030."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Jean Biecher & Fils,45.0,93.0,"The merest touch of lemon appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent, only gradually revealing a touch of orange blossom and apple peel around a very lemony, bright, linear core. This has concentration but no heaviness, there is depth and toned muscle. The finish is dry and alluring, focusing on that lemon purity with a lovely earthy edge of apple peel. Drink 2019–2030."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Everhart Cellars,45.0,93.0,"This classic-style wine has cedar, tobacco and dark fruit aromas, bold and ripe flavors and a structure that's very firm yet not harsh. Cinnamon, clove and allspice accents complement its black cherry and dark chocolate notes, while a thick blanket of tannin wraps it all up."
Grenache,US,Washington,B. Leighton,45.0,93.0,"This inaugural release is 100% varietal that's aged in neutral French puncheons. The panoply of notes includes raspberry seed, dark plum, green olive and nori. The mouthfeel is the true star with a rich, pillowy-soft, palate-coating texture showing exceptional purity and an extended finish."
Pinot Noir,Canada,British Columbia,CedarCreek,45.0,93.0,"Lovely, dense aromas of dried flowers, herbs, cherries and chocolate immediately capture attention. This is a superbly elegant wine, with both precision and power. Orange-peel flavors highlight deep cherry compote, with tension, balance and length in abundance."
Weissburgunder,Austria,Wachau,Josef Jamek,45.0,93.0,"A restrained nose just hints at ripeness: Comice pear perhaps? The palate is full-bodied but sinewy and one feels that the wine will open up in years to come, power is evident, so is deep fruit that still needs to blossom. The muscular structure is full of promise. Drink as of 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Wohlmuth,45.0,93.0,"Subtlety on the nose hides the hazelnutty softness of this pliable, pleasing and gentle wine that has a balm-like structure which almost comes across as soothing. With echoing nuttiness and an apricot core, this does not fit any particular mold, but is intriguing, authentic and totally convincing."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Waits-Mast,45.0,93.0,"Coming from a singular vineyard along the Mendocino coast, this wine has smoky savory flavors that complement the just-ripe fruit flavors and give a truly maverick but easy-to-enjoy personality. It is medium bodied, velvet textured, and has good structure, fine-grained tannins and enough concentration for a lingering finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Quinta do Quetzal,45.0,93.0,"A big wine in every sense, dark in color, the fruit supremely rich without being excessive. It is very structured within its opulent framework. Likely to age well, this is concentrated, dense."
Syrah,US,Washington,K Vintners,45.0,93.0,"Broad and earthy, with a dash of funk and a peppery lift, this grips the tongue with authority and power. It's poised and tense, as if balanced on the edge of a precipice, with the fruit, herb, roasted earth and coffee notes all tumbling around in glorious profusion."
Chardonnay,US,California,Babcock,45.0,93.0,"This is one of the most beloved Chardonnays from Santa Barbara County, and for good reason: Bryan Babcock manages to imbue his wine with buttery richness yet also balance it with acidity and smoke. Honeysuckle, almond and Gravenstein apple aromas lead into energetic yet creamy marshmallow and poached pear flavors, all cut with citrusy acidity."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Élevée Winegrowers,45.0,93.0,"Sourced from a vineyard planted by Gary Andrus in 1998, this elegant and expressive wine is shaded a lovely rose tone, and scents of rose petals and ripe cherries emerge instantly from the glass. It's well defined, balanced and detailed with sandalwood, cocoa powder, cinnamon and orange-liqueur highlights. Drink now through 2021."
Chardonnay,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,45.0,93.0,"This is a boldly expressive testament to the vineyard site from which it comes. A concentrated and lushly textured wine, it exudes lime and a hit of tropical papaya buoyed as it goes by bristling acidity and a hint of wild vanilla. Indicative of a ripe, warm vintage, it remains balanced and deliciously exuberant from start to finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Casca Wines,45.0,93.0,"Big and ripe, this has the firm tannins and solid, mineral structure of the Douro. This is a dense wine, packed with black plum fruits over a dark, concentrated structure. Firm, it also has generous fruitiness. It is ready to drink, but will be better from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casca Wines,45.0,93.0,"Big, rich fruits dominate this impressive wine that also has a concentrated structure of tannins that give power. Full of rich Alicante Bouschet, it is a warm, ripe and rounded wine that still could age. Drink from 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Wynns Coonawarra Estate,45.0,93.0,"There's a noticeable background herbal element to this intensely concentrated wine. Dense layers of cassis and chocolate are front and center, filling the mouth with velvety richness and finishing long. Despite the power and richness, there's a structure to match, suggesting this will improve through at least 2012 and drink well until 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,K Vintners,45.0,93.0,"With its excellent concentration of pure fruit power, this is like taking your mouth through a 100 yard dash of raspberry, blueberry and black cherry fruit, right down the heart of the throat. Along the way you find a tight wrapping of rock and espresso, but it's the snappy, sappy fruit that really shines here. Great length."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Schoffit,45.0,93.0,"The wine is rich, full in the mouth but finely balanced. It has retained plenty of freshness, the white fruits aromatic, mineral and stylish. The ripeness gives an opulent style that leaves a powerful aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Poggiarellino,45.0,93.0,"Underbrush, leather, sun-baked soil and chopped herb aromas emerge from this structured red. Loaded with personality, the palate delivers juicy layers of ripe Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and pipe tobacco flavors, framed by firm, chewy tannins. It's a full-bodied wine that will reward several more years of cellaring. Drink 2019–2032."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Can Blau,45.0,93.0,"A big, balanced, bombastic Montsant made from one-third each of Mazuelo, Garnacha and Syrah. On the bouquet it's the fruit that endears but mocha and vanilla stick out. The flavor profile sees lemony oak, blackberry, blueberry and minerality. Spicy and long late with size and grip. Drink now through 2015."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Ugo Lequio,45.0,93.0,"Red berry, baking spice and grilled herb aromas lead the nose. The taut palate doles out succulent black cherry, raspberry, licorice and a mint note alongside firm but polished tannins. Give this time to open up and unwind. Drink 2017–2024."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Domaine J. Meuret,45.0,93.0,"This wine is aromatically arresting, with notes of honeycomb, candle wax, corn husk, chamomile, almond and stone fruit. The palate has an outrageously textured, detailed, layered feel leading to an extended finish that displays both elegance and richness."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,45.0,93.0,"A smooth, wood-matured wine, this shows all of the richness of Braucol and Duras. Named “the spirit,” it is a true evocation of the rugged nature of Gaillac, with a mineral streak and a big black-fruit flavor. Age for 4–5 years."
Merlot,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Torre a Cona,45.0,93.0,"Black currants, blackberries, grilled herb, cedar and clove aromas lead the nose on this delicious, creamy wine. The smooth, savory palate doles out ripe black cherry, fleshy plum, white pepper, mint and anise. Firm, polished tannins support the juicy fruit flavors."
Zinfandel,US,California,Scott Harvey,45.0,93.0,"While slightly reserved in aroma, this serious, special-occasion wine comes on steady and strong in flavor. Blueberry and black cherry notes pick up more raspberry and red cherry with each sip. In addition to fruit complexity, it has a full body, sleek texture and lingering finish. Best now through 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,45.0,93.0,"Fruit sourced from Red Mountain's top vineyards––Ciel du Cheval, Klipsun and Kiona––comes on rich and fruity, with big and powerful black cherry and cassis interwoven with threads of smoke, coffee, graphite and baking chocolate. Deep, dark and dense."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,45.0,93.0,"This meaty, gamy wine is 84% Mourvèdre, and marries its earthy flavors to the ripe black fruit of the Syrah. The two mix well, but could use a bit more bottle time to fully integrate. Blood, meat, cassis, and smoke mingle, and some heat slips in at the end, along with rich coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Big, flavorful, lingering."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Sol Rouge,45.0,93.0,"Very dark, very focused, and very pure, this full-bodied wine polishes the notorious tannins of the varietal just slightly, while pouring on dark chocolate, blackberry jam, white pepper and a touch of floral flavor. It's a great wine to buy and stash in a cool place for a few years to see how interesting Petite Sirah can get. Best after 2024."
Champagne Blend,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,45.0,93.0,"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this benchmark New York sparkling wine balances pristine apple and lemon against layers of complex toast, caramel and crushed mineral nuances. Brut in style, it calibrates spine tingling acidity against a palate that's supple and ripe. Bold, mouthfilling bubbles dissipate elegantly through a long finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Monticello Vineyards,45.0,93.0,"Extremely seductive aromas of caramel, toasted oak, beach campfire, blackberry, black cherry and thin mint cookies welcome the nose to this bottling. The palate is equally complex and inviting, with milk chocolate, cherry pie, smoked pork and dried oregano flavors, tongue-tantalizing all around."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Rui Roboredo Madeira,45.0,93.0,"This wine is the result of a selection of 12 barrels that were chosen after aging. It is rich, smooth and concentrated, with powerful tannins behind the ripe texture and generous blackberry fruits. It needs to age further; drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sante Arcangeli,45.0,93.0,"From a vineyard perched 1,700 feet above the Monterey Bay, this wine by brewer-turned-vintner John Benedetti is both very light yet incredibly flavorful. Rusty raspberry and strawberry aromas meet with dill, thyme and white pepper on the nose, while the palate offers soft red cherry and gently sprinkled herbs throughout."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Global Wines,45.0,93.0,"This is a dense and very powerful wine that manages to retain a sense of style. It is certainly rich, although the juicy black fruits and acidity give it a great lift of acidity that balances the density and ripeness. The wine is just approaching its maturity although it will be better from 2017."
Syrah,US,California,Brian Benson,45.0,93.0,"Extremely dark fruit tones come from the nose of this wine, including blackberry and black cherry. It also offers touches of red fruit alongside snapped dark chocolate, licorice and a tarragon mintiness. Density and darkness consume the palate too, with blueberry fruit laced by dried basil, oregano, lavender and tar."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Monteviejo,45.0,93.0,"A wonderful wine from the Uco Valley of Mendoza that opens with fine fruit, richness and molten earth. The palate is big as they come but not hard and out of whack, and the flavors are an amalgam of rich black plum, berry fruit, fig paste and chocolate. Smoky and sultry on the back end, with mocha and coffee for finishing notes. Drink now through 2014."
Chardonnay,US,California,Landmark,45.0,93.0,"A lovely single-vineyard Chardonnay that's subtle and complex in pear, lemon and melon, integrated, soft on the palate and completely composed. The mouthfeel is creamy but bright, layers of grapefruit and tangerine accented by a slight tropical vibe."
Chardonnay,US,California,Gary Farrell,45.0,93.0,"Light and floral, this is a complex, well-integrated Chardonnay that's bursting in just-sliced pineapple, with a layering of butterscotch and caramel. It's richly textured yet nicely balanced between savory and sweet. The acidity upholds the wine from entering into dense territory, a celebration of one heck of a sunny vintage in a glass."
Chardonnay,US,California,Acacia,45.0,93.0,"Tropically layered in glazed pineapple and generously vibrant Asian pear, this wine offers heartiness at the beginning that evolves in the glass into a compellingly balanced wine. The oak is there, but well-integrated."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Duorum,45.0,93.0,"Concentrated tannins and rich black plum and currant flavors distinguish this serious, dense wine. It has structure and dry tannins resulting from both the old vine fruit and the barrel aging. This is a wine that deserves some good aging. Drink from 2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Acacia,45.0,93.0,"Toasted oak and caramel apple mark the entry of this wine, from a coveted and steady source of Carneros fruit. Lush and hedonistic in Golden Delicious apple and pear, it retains a core of minerality throughout, finishing clean and bright."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Joseph Mellot,45.0,93.0,"Wood-aged wine, showing both spice and ripe tropical fruits. Mango and pineapple combine with vanilla and coconut milk to give a full, rich wine, though with Sauvignon Blanc's fresh acidity. Age for 2–3 years."
Syrah,US,California,Dragonette,45.0,93.0,"This bottling, from seven cool climate vineyards, makes a great intro into savory Syrah, showing all that peppery might without shoving it down the throat. Cracked peppercorn is redolent on the nose and palate, with the latter also showing raw lamb and beef char. The sip tends toward soy and leather, but with a core of dried blackberry fruit that's familiar to most palates. The texture is tightly woven."
Grenache,US,Washington,Betz Family,45.0,93.0,"Happily, each new vintage of Bésoleil is a bit larger than the previous year, so more people can taste what a joy this wine is. In 2008 it's 82% Grenache, 9% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre. As with all the Betz wines, it is intensely aromatic. The wine glass fairly explodes with scents of grape, plum, raspberry and cherry. In the mouth grace notes offer hints of leaf and fresh herb. Plush and irresistible."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,45.0,93.0,"Nervous, racing acidity casts an electric sheen onto pristine yellow cherry and grapefruit flavors. Semidry in style, this light-footed wine is intensely juicy, but elegantly framed by a vein of chalk and saline minerality. It's complex and vibrantly delicious."
Red Blend,US,California,ONX,45.0,93.0,"This mashup of 62% Syrah, 16% Petite Sirah, 8% Tempranillo, 7% Grenache, 5% Zinfandel and 2% Malbec delivers aromas of black cherry and Chinese five spice as well as mint and black earth. The palate picks up blackberry-laced iced tea with sprigs of mint and pinches of cardamom, alongside spicy gingerbread cake."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Center of Effort,45.0,93.0,"White pepper, tart pomegranate and herbal touches show on the nose of this bottling from winemaker Mike Sinor. There's a strong spice-and-herb quality to the palate, evoking thyme, oregano and black pepper, which gives depth to the black plum skin flavors. It's racy with acidity and vibrant as can be."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio de Tares,45.0,93.0,"If you like lusty, ripe, full-bodied reds, then scoop this up because it's excellent and priced to sell. The nose is rich, crusty and minerally, with a ton of black fruit. The palate is layered and creamy, with ultra- ripe, concentrated black fruit, chocolate and café mocha flavors. Pure and deep; drinkable now and over the next few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Seven Hills,45.0,93.0,"Working with both Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval, winemaker Casey McClellan extracts the essence of both these great vineyards in his Red Mountain cuvées. Here is the raw power of 100% Klipsun Cabernet Sauvignon, full-throttle black fruits and mineral-soaked, chewy, dark tannins. It's all done in a wine with both length and precision; one that will surely age well over at least a decade."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château la Varière,45.0,93.0,"A powerfully concentrated wine, its ripe yellow fruits smoothly filling the mouth with their unctuous honeyed character. Ginger and other spices add an edge to this gorgeous, full wine that needs aging over many years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Black Kite,45.0,93.0,"Pretty, structured, layered and bright, Kite's Rest is a blend of all three block designates found on the 12-acre Black Kite Vineyard on the southern side of the Anderson Valley. The wine highlights attributes found in its sister wines."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta Vale Dona Maria,45.0,93.0,"A beautifully smooth wine, with a rich Port-like texture. The dry, firm tannins give the wine impressive structure, although it remains opulent, its dark fruit, cocoa and herbal flavors just breathing the concentration of the Douro."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Buena Vista,45.0,93.0,"This is an old-world-style Pinot Noir that many a Francophile will love. Adorned in spice, earth and herbs, it is light in color and texture, with a deft approach to oak. Dark cherry fruit abounds around a silky, sublime mouthfeel."
Chardonnay,US,California,Testarossa,45.0,93.0,"The single-vineyard experts at Testarossa hit a homerun with this wine from a famed property. Aromas of 7-Up, recent rains and minerality kick off a refreshing experience, which is powered by a strong flavor combination of very ripe fruit (à la traditional California Chardonnay), barrel-related vanilla and brisk, lingering acidity (à la Old World)."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Leithaberg,Gernot and Heike Heinrich,45.0,93.0,"Blueberry, blackberry, smoke and white pepper unite to create a mysterious, almost brooding impression. This is still tightly coiled, but the flowing, silky-smooth palate with its slender poise and core of freshness suggest that with a little bottle age, this will emerge as a supremely elegant, subtly fruited wine. The finish turns away from darker fruit and ends on ripe, red cherry."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kessler-Haak,45.0,93.0,"A darker take on the grape for the estate, this bottling shows black tea, violet, dark cherry, bay and a touch of tar on the nose. Deep boysenberry fruit pops on the palate, lifted by brighter notes of dill, eucalyptus and menthol."
Chardonnay,US,California,Dunstan,45.0,93.0,"Winemaker Kenneth Juhasz sources fruit from the Ranch House Block within the larger Durell Vineyard for this wine. From Wente clones, it offers intensity and bracing acidity—a crisp, bright and stony celebration that's both lovely and sublime. Its gravelly texture recalls rock candy and apple sprinkled with spice."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Il Conventino,45.0,93.0,"Violet, perfumed berry, new leather, cinnamon and mint aromas follow through to the elegant palate, lifting its juicy core of plum and ripe Morello cherry flavors. A licorice note signals the close while firm, fine-grained and polished tannins provide support. Drink 2018–2027."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Caparzo,45.0,93.0,"Lovely fragrances of pressed powder, black berries, rose and tilled soil waft from the glass. The firm palate offers wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and savory herb alongside tightly knit but refined tannins. Fresh acidity balances this out but it's still young and not fully developed. Drink 2020–2030."
Grenache,US,Washington,Latta,45.0,93.0,"Light in color, this 100% varietal wine was macerated with 50% stems and 50% whole berries before being aged in 500L neutral French-oak puncheons. It's perfumed with dark raspberries, cherry Jolly Ranchers, herbs, lavender, potpourri and mineral. The outrageously supple yet rich, supremely elegant mouthfeel dazzles."
Zinfandel,US,California,Lone Madrone,45.0,93.0,"Sourced from a dry-farmed, 40-year-old vineyard, this Zin offers aromas of red brick, cherry syrup, licorice, black sage, shaved nutmeg and nose-tickling baking spices. The grippy palate is driven by sagebrush and chemise, with ample amounts of pepper and spice giving nuance to the ripe blackberry fruit."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Comm. G. B. Burlotto,45.0,93.0,"Scents of ripe dark-skinned berry, rose, iris and a balsamic note take shape in the glass. The juicy palate offers ripe black cherry, star anise, orange peel and grilled herb framed in tightly knit but refined tannins. A clove note backs up the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos,45.0,93.0,"This is a rich, concentrated while also fruity wine. With its solid tannins that are finely integrated into the rich, black plum fruit flavors, it is already a very fine wine and presently drinkable; however, another year would not hurt, so best to savor this dense blend of Alicante Bouschet, Petit Verdot and Syrah after 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Jamie Slone Wines,45.0,93.0,"A delicious nose combines smoky oregano, thyme, marjoram, mushroom and cherry aromas on this wine from a former race-car driver. The palate jumps on the palate with glee, showing botanical flavors of juniper, eucalyptus and peppercorn, laid across a brambleberry backbone."
Viognier,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,45.0,93.0,"Another very successful Virgilius, the 2013 comes across as slightly more restrained on the nose, but explodes on the palate with bold flavors of apricot, floral notes and layers of gingery spice. It's a big, rich wine, with a slightly warm but elegant finish. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Langoa Barton,45.0,93.0,"Firmly tannic and concentrated, this wine demonstrates how this property has developed impressively in recent years. It is certainly powerful, although managing to retain the Saint-Julien elegance. The blackberry fruits will develop well as it matures. Drink from 2024."
Chardonnay,US,California,Trombetta,45.0,93.0,"Dark hay in color, this vineyard-designate features lifted acidity and subtle oak around anise, green-apple tartness and a lovely integration of strength and grace. Ultimately light-bodied and crisp, it's also complex, with a lengthy finish showing just the right tease of caramel."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,William Fèvre,45.0,93.0,"A beautifully balanced wine, mixing an intense, nervy, crisp fruit character with light wood flavors and the most piercing acidity. This is a serious wine, for aging over 3–5 years while retaining impeccable fruit."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Transcendence,45.0,93.0,"Cola, smoked cherries, rhubarb, earthy beets, crushed cloves and a touch of iron show on the nose of this wine by Kenneth Joey Gummere. The attention-grabbing texture on the grippy palate unleashes flavors of earthy rhubarb, beet, rose hips and a touch of mint."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kynsi,45.0,93.0,"Turned earth is very apparent on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard, with crushed shale and loam dust as well as cinnamon spice and a red-cherry backbone. The sip shows deep pomegranate and black-raspberry fruit with gingerbread, hibiscus and a touch of thyme. It's rich in the midpalate, with extreme spice throughout."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Central Otago,Quartz Reef,45.0,93.0,"Owner-winemaker Rudi Bauer believes in making Pinot Noirs that can age, so it's no surprise that this is darker, firmer and more muscular than most. There's plenty of toast, cedar and coffee-bean-like oak, but it's amply supported by plum and black cherry fruit. The finish is silky enough to make this wine approachable now, but it will likely improve through at least 2025."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Rieflé,45.0,93.0,"Gold in color and unctuously sweet, this is a dense wine. The sweetness is cut with a dry edge and some fresh acidity. It tastes delicious now with flavors of wild honey and apricot skins, but it will certainly age well. Drink until 2024."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Rieflé,45.0,93.0,This is a very young wine with a long life ahead of it. It's the ultimate Alsace combination of botrytis and Riesling. Brisk acidity and steely structure combine with flavors of ripe honey and dried apricots to yield an impressive wine. Drink from 2016.
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Rieflé,45.0,93.0,"Hugely perfumed, this is a ripe, very rich wine with stacks of flavor piled upon each other. It's a naturally opulent wine, that's sweet with tropical fruits and honey in equal measure. It is very ready to drink, but will also age well, so drink until 2021."
Chardonnay,US,California,Solomon Hills,45.0,93.0,"A remarkable wine from the appellation's westernmost property, this shows lemon, honeydew, pomelo pith, tangerine skin and a touch of hazelnut on the nose. Lots of steely notes power the palate, with flavors of honeysuckle, pears and tangelo racing across the tongue. It's a perfect Chard for shellfish."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Pewsey Vale,45.0,93.0,"This release deserves some sort of award for consistency, year in and year out. The 2011 is light to medium in body and long, zesty and vibrant on the finish. Aromas and flavors of bergamot, honey (although the wine is completely dry) and toast are classic aged Eden Valley Riesling. Drink now–2030."
Syrah,US,Washington,K Vintners,45.0,93.0,"Coming from 1984 plantings—the oldest in the valley—this wine beguiles, with restrained aromas of kirsch, wet stone and plum alongside high tone herb notes. The fruit flavors are layered, possessing a sense of vibrancy and length on the coffee and fruit filled finish. It shows great balance and persistence."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Jean-Luc Baldès,45.0,93.0,"Named after the quail that inhabit the vineyard, this intensely fruity wine is ripe and full-bodied. Flavors of truffles, spice as well as black plums and berries abound. This is a serious wine for aging; keep for at least seven years, although with its great fruit it could be deliciously drinkable sooner."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Albino Rocca,45.0,93.0,"This elegant Barbaresco has an intensely floral bouquet of rose, violet and iris, plus whiffs of sage and balsam. The palate offers juicy, wild cherry flavors punctuated with truffle, and balsamic notes of Alpine herbs. It's impeccably balanced, with ample length."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Champ de Rêves,45.0,93.0,"This effort has a beautiful, fresh cherry aroma, silky texture and bright but ripe fruit flavors subtly accented by spices. It strikes a harmonious chord with great flavors, vibrant texture and wonderful varietal personality."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lost Canyon,45.0,93.0,"This vineyard-designate rocks its way into your heart, opening in spicy, soft aromas of cinnamon stick and dark, luscious fruit and toasted oak. Medium in body with a light finish, it teases along the way in fragrant rose petals and orange blossom."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,45.0,93.0,"This is a veritable bargain for the incredible quality it delivers. It's lavishly composed, with a flurry of floral, fruity attributes—cherry blossoms, sweet peaches, and yellow plums—all kissed with honey, and a shower of lemon-lime acidity. Enjoy now for its youthful exuberance, but put a few away to see its honeyed tones darken and mature over the next decade."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Cadence,45.0,93.0,"A blend of Cabernet Franc (35%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (18%) with the rest equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine offers brooding notes of herbs, black currant, mineral and flowers. The lighter color belies its rich structure of firm tannins and tart, lively acids that merit time in the cellar to be fully appreciated. Best after 2018 but will be well worth the wait."
Pinot Nero,Italy,Piedmont,Colombo,45.0,93.0,"Structured and refined, this opens with aromas of mature berry, a hint of leather, savory herb and cooking spice. The focused palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, black pepper and licorice alongside youthfully austere tannins. Give this time to wind down and develop complexity. Drink 2018–2024."
Syrah,US,California,Arcadian,45.0,93.0,"This is a current release from Joe Davis, who holds his wines back until their prime. Hailing from Ballard Canyon, it shows black plum, pressed purple flowers, tanned leather and balsamic notes on the nose. There's a pleasantly yet softly structured texture to the palate, where dried blackberry, roast beef, lilac and Concord grape flavors arise."
Chardonnay,US,California,Beauregard,45.0,93.0,"From a small appellation near Bonny Doon that this family has farmed for half a century comes this zesty wine, with aromas of seared lemons, caramelized nectarine, browned butter and hard apple candy. The palate shows warm apples, roasted almonds and a shred of iodine, finishing with dried apricot and pressed white flowers."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sojourn,45.0,93.0,"Golden honey and apple aromas open the door to a fulsome, rounded and sensually textured vineyard-designate, with a fruity core laced in nutmeg. Medium bodied yet lush, it retains a lingering persistence of acidity that keeps it fresh and bright on the palate."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Timbre,45.0,93.0,"Josh Klapper made six barrels of this wine from coveted old vines at Bien Nacido Vineyard. The result is an exciting, focused expression of minerality, with wet cement prominent on the nose alongside black cherry, alpine strawberry and a touch of vanilla dust. Light and lithe in mouthfeel yet still packed with tons of flavor, the old vines unleash cranberry, pomegranate, orange rind, thyme, bay leaf and eucalyptus flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,De Loach,45.0,93.0,"Dark golden in color and high in acidity, this vineyard-designate was made in small amounts with great skill. Yellow apple skin and a slight slant to tropical guava provide a fleshy intensity and burst of weight on the palate, before the wine settles down and finishes long and lean."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Baumard,45.0,93.0,"Just beginning to soften, this is turning into a finely crafted, fruity wine with a tense, mineral structure. It is complex, ripe, packed with apples and with acidity. Taut, it needs to develop further. Drink from 2018."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Giacomo Fenocchio,45.0,93.0,"This structured wine opens with a quintessential Nebbiolo nose of wild berry, baking spice, grilled herb, fragrant blue flower and a balsamic note. The bracing palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, clove, licorice and a smattering of chopped herb alongside brisk acidity and tightly knit tannins. Drink 2019–2031."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Januik,45.0,93.0,"A tight, metallic streak runs vertically through this Cabernet. Deep cassis fruit, juicy acids and the mineral/metal signature of the vineyard combine in a well-structured wine with an extended finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Marimar Estate,45.0,93.0,"Not much of this wine is made and that's a shame. A celebration of richness and creaminess on the palate, the wine is given extended lees contact to contribute both texture and complexity. Marked by oaky caramel notes on the nose and palate, the wine also shows minerality and freshness, especially on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,45.0,93.0,"Oaky on the nose, with a whiff of caramelized honey, this ripe, robust wine finds its balance through a veneer of fruity tarte Tatin and rocky minerality. Still unwinding in the bottle, it needs time to open. It'll drink nicely now through 2022."
Chardonnay,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,45.0,93.0,"As delicious as its 2012 counterpart, yet needing more time, this vineyard-designate shines in high acidity and swirls of lemon and tangerine, remaining balanced in weight and volume in body and structure. With suggestions of ginger throughout, it finishes briny."
Syrah,US,Washington,Gramercy,45.0,93.0,"An outstanding and uniquely styled Syrah. The mix of tart fruits, peppers, herbs, earth and forest floor flavors is riveting. The wine dances and bows, it takes you on a leaping trip through a world of Syrah rarely found anywhere else, buoyed by the brilliant natural acidity of Washington fruit."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Rasa,45.0,93.0,"A rare 100% varietal Mourvèdre. The tannins are superb, almost silky, almost impossible to achieve with this rough and tumble grape. Dark, smoky, earthy and still refined, this seduces with clean, wild blueberry fruit, just hinting at a mountain berry sweetness."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Lexington,45.0,93.0,"Suave and interesting on the nose, this bottling packs in a lot of magic. Pepper, blueberry, violet cake, dust, Sichuan peppercorn and chipped slate show on the nose. Finely grained tannins provide a chalky texture, while a rising acidity presents flavors of elderberry, underripe blueberry, tobacco and powerful florality in this great varietal expression."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Capitain-Gagnerot,45.0,93.0,It is rare to find mature red Burgundy being sold directly from the producer's cellar. This 2008 from an above-average vintage is certainly showing signs of rich maturity. It has developed the undergrowth aromas and spice flavors of ready-to-drink Pinot Noir. It has also retained plenty of acidity. It is a lightly tannic wine that is ready to drink.
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Cave de Ribeauvillé,45.0,93.0,"Apricot compote and candied peach shine on nose and palate with great intensity. The overtly floral notes of rose have given way to a more subtle perfume that highlights the aromas of peach above all. This is very concentrated, very rich, but also precise and fresh. It is citrus tanginess that allows this to be sweet yet still refreshing. Medium to sweet finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Abeja,45.0,93.0,"This wine is pulled from vineyards across the Columbia Valley, including Heather Hill, Bacchus, Dionysus, Ciel du Cheval and Destiny Ridge. A nuanced wine, it shows winemaker John Abbott in top form with its rich, layered fruit flavors, dazzling sense of texture and lengthy finish. It's drinking beautifully but promises to have a long life in front of it in the cellar."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Il Molino di Grace,45.0,93.0,"Earthy aromas of leather, tilled soil, blue flower, mature black fruit and a balsamic note waft from the glass. The firm palate delivers spiced plum, ripe black cherry, menthol, vanilla, mocha and well-integrated oak alongside youthfully assertive tannins. Drink 2015–2025."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,45.0,93.0,"The appetizing perfume of candied orange peel rises seductively from the glass. The palate counters with the very fresh but ripe fruit of fleshy juicy yellow mirabelles. These are joined by tangy, zesty grapefruit freshness, creating a concentrated fruit-driven palate of great tension and concentration. This is a wonderful tightrope act between tang and generosity. The finish is long and clean."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Carnuntum,Artner,45.0,93.0,"Sumptuous oak flavors of cinnamon, blueberry notes and spicy pepper make for an impressive olfactory trio. The palate comes across as velvety but fresh, echoing these same flavors, emphasizing pepper and blueberry. The structure is big and bold and fully supported by oak, but the crunchy fruit freshness holds the balance. This has a fruity finish and would need some hearty meat to be drunk now. Otherwise drink 2019–2029."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Jäger,45.0,93.0,"Lovely notions of both ripe and green pear rise from the glass. There also is a more savory edge reminiscent of moss and yeast. This comes out even more on the fresh concentrated palate with a lovely salty peppery nuance that makes this very moreish and thrilling. The flavors, amply supported by zesty citrus, just last."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Centovigne,45.0,93.0,"Made entirely with Nebbiolo from Alto Piemonte, this boasts alluring aromas of ripe black-skinned berries, dark cooking spices, cut roses, new leather and tilled earth. The taut, elegant palate is loaded with flavor and finesse, delivering mature black cherries, cranberries, licorice and tobacco framed in youthfully assertive but polished tannins. Fresh acidity provides balance. Drink 2019–2031."
Syrah,US,Washington,Two Vintners,45.0,93.0,"Coming from The Rocks District, the herb, green stem, black olive, peat, wet stone and floral aromas are expansive. The potpourri and savory flavors are broad in feel and exquisitely balanced, capped off by a long finish. Stunning stuff."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Cadence,45.0,93.0,"Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon each take up 38% of this blend, with the rest equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot. It captivates with aromas of black licorice, purple flowers, earth and herbs. The style is reserved, more focused on acid and tannin structure, but it still shows layers of textured fruit flavors. It will be best 2020–2030."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Waits-Mast,45.0,93.0,"This lovely Pinot Noir has an appealing baked crust quality with structured, firm tannins and ripe cherry goodness all around. From the steep, 900-foot-elevation Wentzel Vineyard, it exudes robust fruit flavor and layers of just-right spice."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Darioush,45.0,93.0,"From the producer's estate vineyard on Mount Veeder, this 100% varietal vineyard designate is oaky, viscous and intensely flavored with green apple, melon and peach. Delicious honeysuckle and grapefruit peel aromas make it all the more compelling, balancing its voluptuous weight and ripeness."
Chardonnay,US,California,Testarossa,45.0,93.0,"With a nose approaching butterscotch but expertly cut with acidity and cinnamon spice, this is the best Testarossa single-vineyard Chardonnay of 2012. On the palate, there are lovely flavors of salted caramel and yellow peach, and the wine manages to be simultaneously spicy, sharp and smooth. The finish lingers extra long."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Leda,45.0,93.0,"Early on it displays mild heat and jamminess, but with airing everything settles, and ultimately this old-vines Tempranillo from the lauded winemaker Mariano Garcia excels. The palate is rich, minerally and meaty, with slightly syrupy black fruit flavors, molasses and chocolate. Chewy, tannic and pure on the finish, with hints of herbs and lemon peel. Drink now through 2013."
Nebbiolo,US,California,Giornata,45.0,93.0,"Vibrant red plum and cherry aromas meet hibiscus, cinnamon and a touch of inviting cotton candy on the nose of this bottling. The palate brims with cinnamon spice, baked strawberry and red plum, further enhanced by licorice and ginger snap flavors. The structure is elegantly grippy."
Syrah,US,California,Alienor,45.0,93.0,"The wine is stunning, full of bright red fruit and a soft tinge of French bread, tightly structured with dark wood and a leathery component. A beautiful example of what can happen when the right winemaker and site collide: The finish is long and the wine is one to remember."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova,45.0,93.0,"This richly fruity wine has poise and elegance as well as a powerful structure. A light herbal character brings out the juicy fruits as well as a mint flavor. The wine is ripe although with its serious tannic element, it does need to age. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Oregon,Tero Estates,45.0,93.0,"This is a field blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, and 6% Malbec, all co-fermented and estate-grown. It's nicely evolved, ripe and fruity—a flavor cavalcade of pastry fruits and spices, fig, twig, cacao and coffee. Yes you may cellar this wine, but why wait? It's drinking beautifully."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Baxter,45.0,93.0,"Structured and fully developed, this showcases the strong 2009 vintage, the Oppenlander Vineyard and the brilliance that is Baxter. Marked by bright black-cherry fruit and a heady perfume of rose, this carries itself with elegance and a light touch. This is Pinot Noir purposely made to pair with food."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Trinity Vineyards,45.0,93.0,"Trinity's first-ever reserve is a beauty; half the barrels were new French oak, half neutral. Well-defined with juicy, citrus-flavored acidity, the cherry/berry fruit runs deep and true, while the oak aging adds buttered toast and nut oil. It offers exceptional value for the price."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Kumeu,Kumeu River,45.0,93.0,"The 2011 Hunting Hill is an immediately seductive Chardonnay. Toasted nuts, grilled white peaches and hints of pineapple all come together on a sumptuous midpalate, then finish bright, citrusy and long."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,45.0,93.0,"This wine has both great richness and a cool, stylish side. It's structured, with a strong streak of minerality as well as as spice and pepper. It has a cool, restrained feel at the moment, waiting for the time to burst out with its complex structure. Hold at least until 2017."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Betz Family,45.0,93.0,"Bob Betz continues to refine his Bordeaux blends. This new Clos de Betz is much more forward than the monumental Père de Famille and sports ripe, dark, round, appealing fruit flavors of luscious raspberry and cassis, swathed in beaucoup de barrel. Toasty oak dissolves into polished tannins, finishing with black tea, licorice, smoke and charcoal."
Chardonnay,US,California,Pellegrini,45.0,93.0,"Rich and creamy, this beguiling wine offers a counterweight of lightness and balance, finding as much lemon and lime zest as baked apple and pear within its layers of flavor. Lifted in minerality, it offers accents of vanilla and honey on the finish, making the wine both complex and completely delicious."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,California,G & L Lurton,45.0,93.0,"This stellar blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot is woven together with care, revealing an earthy bouquet of leather and compost. Old World in style, with its light approach and elegant underpinnings, it offers layers of clove, black pepper and graphite flavors within a balanced frame."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Camlow,45.0,93.0,"The Big Pig Vineyard, for which this wine is named, is the producer's estate vineyard, a site planted to four Pinot clones. Altogether it's stunning, a vibrant mix of funky lavender and licorice that's big in both flavor and presence on the palate, with a grip of soft tannins. The finish is concentrated in black cherry, with a seasoning of Asian spice."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette,45.0,93.0,"This is a bold wine in all senses. It is packed with fruit, dry tannins and a dense texture from vines planted not long after Alain Dominique Perrin began Lagrézette's restoration in the '80s. The blend of 87% Malbec, 12% Merlot and 1% Tannat presents powerful tannins and generous fruitiness. This estate wine will be slow to develop and to reveal its full ripe potential, so drink after 2020."
Grenache,US,Oregon,Cowhorn,45.0,93.0,"This stellar wine has a huge yum factor. Deliciously ripe and spicy, it's loaded with cranberry and raspberry fruit. There's an underlying tang of pink grapefruit acidity, along with aromatic highlights of violets and rose petals. Drink now through 2022."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sleeping Giant,45.0,93.0,"This is a lovely white made by Chris Dearden. Whole-cluster pressed and fermented in once-used French oak, the grapes are sourced from a 12-acre parcel planted to Old Wente clone Chardonnay. Dark golden in hue, it has graceful acidity and a burst of lemon blossom on the nose that evolves into a sublime lightness and crispness on the palate."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Trombetta,45.0,93.0,"Silky in texture, with a tannic bite, this lovely wine is spicy in cinnamon and clove, buoyed by ripe plum and wild strawberry. Medium in weight, it's complex and measured, balanced by a leathery, smooth finish and lively acidity."
Red Blend,Italy,Veneto,Pasqua,45.0,93.0,"Aromas of baked plum, exotic spice and vanilla almost jump out of the glass. The aromas follow through to the full-bodied, savory palate along with ripe black cherry, blackberry and mocha while velvety tannins give it a smooth, polished texture. It closes on a confectionary note."
Chardonnay,US,California,Hunnicutt,45.0,93.0,"This wine has a gorgeous golden color, and follows through with a beautifully honeyed nose of vibrancy and richness. Lemongrass and ginger provide an exotic landscape on which to build integrated oak and lingering acidity."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,kukkula,45.0,93.0,"There are loads of fresh floral and red spice notes on the nose of this blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah: hibiscus, cinnamon, dried cherry and baking spice. The palate leads with a touch of maple syrup, filling out with red berry, savory smoke and thyme flavors, underpinned by upright tannins and refreshing acidity."
Tannat,US,California,Moxy,45.0,93.0,"Hearty aromas of blueberry, leather, uncrushed peppercorns, fresh violets and a touch of oak smoke greet the nose on this rich and delicious bottling. There is a deep density to the sip, where smoky flavors wrap around lavish black fruit, reminiscent of a pepper-crusted, teriyaki-soaked roast of beef."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Trimbach,45.0,93.0,"The subtlest notes of earth and honey suggest an evolving wine. The palate takes these further and wraps them up in fruit flavors that owe as much to lemon zest as they do to the peel of pear and russet apple. There is focus and poise on the palate and real tension between toned, muscular fruit and sprightly freshness. This is just coming out of its shell. Drink 2016–2026."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Lagune,45.0,93.0,"The freshness of 2004 is the hallmark of this deliciously ripe but elegant wine. It is packed with juicy red berry fruits, giving richness but vibrant acidity."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Domaine de Suremain,45.0,93.0,A seven-acre vineyard on the eastern side of Mercurey gives a wine that is broad and ripe. Both its structure and its juicy red fruits are generous and with a firm core of tannins. The wine is likely to age well. Drink from 2022.
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio de Tares,45.0,93.0,"Grapy blackberry and cassis aromas come with charred oak and pastry-like richness. In the mouth, this notoriously ripe Mencía is loaded with tannins. Spicy blackberry flavors can handle the classy oak this wine has seen, while flavors of tobacco, lemon and spice drape over a full-fruited finish. Drink through the 2020s."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,François Baur,45.0,93.0,"The richest and most generous hints of dried pear and fruit loaf rise from the glass. The palate continues in the same, generous vein with plenty of pear, shimmering and scintillating with juicy, mellow and just off-dry ripeness. This is countered by fresh lemon zestiness and leaves a totally balanced and very lasting impression. There are pleasant highlights of bitterness and that pervasive sense of pear fruit just lasts and lasts."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Stonestreet,45.0,93.0,"This wine is quite an accomplishment in flavor and complexity given the vintage and the price. From high-altitude vineyards atop the Mayacamas, it delivers peppercorn, herb and fine, well-integrated tannins, with mellow oak. Graphite and cedar also figure into the mix, with a shock of black cherry and cassis weaved within. Drink now through 2019."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,El Nido,45.0,93.0,"An intense bouquet with resiny oak, coconut, fig, prune and blackberry aromas is staunch and heady. This is yet another lush, deep, high-alcohol wine from the Gil family. Baked black-fruit flavors register at max ripeness, while flavors of coffee, chocolate and toast push the finish on this flamboyant Monastrell blend. Drink through 2020."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,45.0,93.0,"There are plenty of tannins in this still-young wine. Wood as well as fruit tannins are firm and concentrated, and still developing. Beside this structure, the fruit is also impressive: a rich medley of dark plums, ripe berry fruits and fine acidity. Drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Limerick Lane,45.0,93.0,"Juicy and balanced in red and black berry, this is meaty, smoky and accessible wine, as complex and sultry as any of its vineyard or block-designates, yet softer and rounder, ready to play. A handful of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Peloursin and Negrette are included."
Chardonnay,US,California,Chamisal Vineyards,45.0,93.0,"Winemaker Fintan du Fresne nails the combination of richness and freshness in this bottling. The nose offers clean lines of wet cement, lemongrass, Gravenstein apple and a slightly exotic spice. Chilled Asian pear flavors kick off the sip, but then comes a buttery, macadamia nut warmth that's hedonistic and delicious."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Seven Hills,45.0,93.0,"Hailing from one of the state's most esteemed vineyard sites, this wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon and just over a quarter Merlot, with the balance Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. The oak (40% new French) is dialed back, allowing rich, layered notes of plum, herbs, licorice, toast and coffee to rise with a firm scaffolding of slightly dry tannins supporting them. Still young, it will be best after 2018."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Leithaberg,Nittnaus Anita und Hans,45.0,93.0,"Elderberry and black cherry have a lovely tinge of iron oxide. Edges of tart, dark berries creep in, too. This is balanced and full of shimmering, intriguing fruit with layers of earth and minerality. An aromatic joy, beautiful already but with the potential to become even better 2017–2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sojourn,45.0,93.0,"A rich golden color, this unctuous offering is luxuriously layered in honeycomb and vanilla crème brûlée, complex, big and bold. A wall of oak adds structure and density without taking over, opening the door to a finish of juicy ripe fig."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Domaine de Suremain,45.0,93.0,"This dark wine is still full of young tannins from a cool, east-facing vineyard. The red-berry fruit is beginning to show through, crisp and tight with considerable acidity. The wine will take time to develop and will not be ready before 2019."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Rocca Giovanni,45.0,93.0,"Toast, ripe dark berry and camphor aromas take shape in the glass while the chewy palate offers ripe raspberry, juicy black cherry, uplifting mint and a mineral note. Youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2025."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Trombetta,45.0,93.0,"The oak treatment is supportive only, with the wine aged in French oak, 25% of it new, for nine months. Restraint allows it to remain soft and silky on the palate, with inviting characteristics of white pepper, lavender, rose, cranberry, strawberry and vanilla bean."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Dunham,45.0,93.0,"Sharp, spicy, tight, and focused, this is one of the best of the numbered Cabs from Dunham in the past few years. It's sleek, polished and sappy, with perfect balance, and a riveting depth of black raspberry, black cherry and cassis fruit. The tannins are soft and polished, hinting at black tea and coffee grounds."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bargetto,45.0,93.0,"There is a dense floral power on the nose of this wine from a vineyard near Watsonville, with suggestions of concentrated violets, cinnamon, sandalwood, cedar and beet juice. The palate is more sanguine, with raspberry-pomegranate-cranberry juice, black slate, smoked meat and garden herbs, showing tons of length on the finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Bonny Doon,45.0,93.0,"Randall Grahm's blend of 37% Mourvèdre, 34% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 9% Cinsault offers intriguing asphalt, black pepper, boysenberry and a tiny bit of barnyard funk on the nose. It's dark and brooding, with flavors of black pepper, leather and black fruits on the palate, but rather light and lean in texture, with a solid amount of tannic grip."
Syrah,US,Washington,Sleight of Hand,45.0,93.0,"Reserved aromas of cherry, chocolate, thistle, moist earth and dark berry lead to red and black fruit flavors that are sumptuous, rich and layered. It brings immediate appeal but also offers plenty of cellaring potential—a complete delight that appeals on multiple levels."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Gaffelière,45.0,93.0,"The second wine of this Premier Grand Cru Classé estate is very fine. With its rich tannins, generous acidity and black fruits, it is solid and dense while having such attractive fruitiness. The wine will age well, full of ripe fruit and with excellent concentration. Drink from 2021."
Chardonnay,US,California,Freeman,45.0,93.0,"Butter, hazelnut and marzipan aromas give a lush first impression, and then vibrant lemon and green-apple acidity provides a firm, balancing effect. This bright-gold, full-bodied wine is concentrated, layered and deep, without being too rich or heavy. Subtle nuances of nutmeg and ginger add to its complexity on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Proidl,44.0,93.0,"The merest touch of passion fruit enriches the ripe pear fruit apparent on the nose with a hint of the tropics. The palate is wonderfully zesty and the gorgeous grapefruit freshness harnesses all the ripe fruit into a driven force of joy. This is concentrated, juicy and utterly moreish."
G-S-M,US,California,Big Basin,44.0,93.0,"Brooding black currant, blackberry pie aromas meet with clove, sweet tobacco, black tea and hot cola on the nose of this blend of 49% Grenache, 27% Syrah and 24% Mourvèdre from the Coastview, Antle and Brosseau vineyards. There is candied Concord grape fruit to the energetic, light-on-its-feet sip, along with bay leaf, sage, marjoram and thyme."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Big Basin,44.0,93.0,"From a 16-year-old vineyard 2,200 feet up on the eastside of the Salinas Valley, this bottling offers fresh raspberry juice along with touches of bay leaf, pine and incense, like a morning walk through the forest. There is sizzling acidity at the start of the sip, which carries light, bright and tangy strawberry flavors along with more forest floor touches. The structure is upright but light."
Merlot,US,New York,The Grapes of Roth,44.0,93.0,"Since its inception, Wölffer winemaker Roman Roth's namesake Merlot has been one of the best wines in Long Island. The 2012 bottling is no exception. It's a bold, densely fruity wine full of luscious black cherry, plum and currant flavors. Powerful yet finessed, it's keenly anchored by a core of cranberry acidity and complexities of bramble, violet and spice. Delicious already but sure to improve through at least 2030."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Stemmler,44.0,93.0,"Gorgeous fruit aromas and flavors fill out this plush-textured and softly balanced wine. It offers ripe black cherry and raspberry tones and a full body, but has a delightful, light touch on the palate. The finish lingers nicely, too."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Westwood,44.0,93.0,"A lovely bouquet of dusty rose petals marks the entry of this delightful wine. Softly textured, it's subtle in tannin and oak, with interweaving swathes of black tea and grenadine-intense cherry. Medium bodied, it remains silky and fresh through the lengthy finish."
G-S-M,US,California,Big Basin,44.0,93.0,"A wondrously rich and extracted nose combines layers of brown spice, dried black cherries, fragrant violets and lilacs with concentrated, almost pruney purple fruit. That ripeness expertly pairs on the palate with strong tannic structure and sparkling acidity, allowing the blackberry, blueberry, caramel and lavender notes to shine without cloying."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Foundry,44.0,93.0,"Made in a Méthode Champenoise style from well-farmed vineyards, this Blanc de Blancs is sharp in acidity and biting flavors of green apple and lemon zest. Crisp and fresh, it's also complex and slightly brooding, weaving in waves of brioche and almond as it goes."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine Nigri,44.0,93.0,"The wine is rich, honeyed and full of ripe marmalade and apricot jelly flavors. At the same time, it has the fine shot of acidity and crispness that gives Jurançon its elegance and individuality. This is delicious to drink now, although it would be much better to wait and drink it from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Dierberg,44.0,93.0,"The nose of this bottling from winemaker Tyler Thomas is simultaneously delicate and voluptuous, with strawberry, plump plum, crushed slate and pepper seasonings. The palate is focused, with fresh red fruit, a rocky structure and strong thyme, marjoram and sage characteristics. Soft and delicious, it finishes with a dried strawberry kick."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Woodward Canyon,44.0,93.0,"Woodward Canyon makes one of Washington's most interesting Chardonnays, blending fruit from the old vines at Celilo in the Columbia Gorge, with estate-grown grapes from the western end of the Walla Walla Valley. In this cooler vintage, the wine remains beautifully proportionate, round and fruity, with pretty apple, pear and peach highlights. There is a light dusting of spice, and a lick of caramel on the finish."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,CVNE,44.0,93.0,A ripe fruity set of berry and cassis aromas shows a slight hint of raisin. This is a stacked saturated wine with raw tannins and plenty of power. Blackberry and earthy notes finish stout and compact: this doesn't vary or waver on the back end. Best from 2019–2026.
Pinot Noir,US,California,Black Ridge,44.0,93.0,"Baked strawberries and red cherries pair deliciously with shaved nutmeg, vanilla and black tea leaves on the nose of this bottling. There is a strong black plum tang to the sip, which is decorated lavishly with thyme, bay leaf, rust and gravel—a very elegant expression overall."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Epiphany,44.0,93.0,"Fess Parker's sister winery hits a savory home run with this blend of 62% Syrah and 38% Grenache, which presents game, leather, blackberry extract and sage on the nose. Purple fruit leads the palate, with dark chocolate on the midpalate and strong acidity and smooth tannins throughout."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Wrights Station,44.0,93.0,"This block-designation wine from the tip of the appellation shows an extremely spicy nose of incense and concentrated hibiscus. It proves rather light on the palate, yet bounces with the flavors of rose petals and violets, emerging into black pepper, clove and cinnamon. It's lean yet bountiful with intrigue."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,CVNE,44.0,93.0,"Imperial is CVNE's most accessible and affordable top-end Rioja, and what a winner it is in 2010. Cool, toasty aromas show sweet maple and vanilla notes along with berry and cassis scents. Fresh but weighty and elegant, this deals ripe berry and loamy earth flavors in front of a mellow finish that's clean and not too demanding. Drink now through 2022."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot,44.0,93.0,"Pure strawberry and red cherry fruits with a twist of acidity make this a wine that is already delicious. Just under the surface is a firm wood-and-tannin character and a dense, if juicy, structure. Age for 4–5 years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Samuel Louis Smith,44.0,93.0,"Vinified by the former Margerum winemaker (who now works for Morgan Winery), this bottling from one of the appellation's most exciting vineyards is chock-full of baked red cherry, vanilla, clove and gravel aromas. Though light and bright in body, the palate packs intriguing flavors, from raspberry and rose petal to dried fennel and dill."
Pinot Noir,US,California,St. Rose,44.0,93.0,"This tiny-production wine continues to impress vintage after vintage, a small project of the Nunes family, who otherwise farm Nunes Vineyard. Aged in a selection of new and once and twice-used French oak, it impresses in wound-up kirsch, baked bread and cardamom spice, remaining both high toned and smoothly complex on the palate. Rose petals and citrus flirt into the body of the wine as well as the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Silver Mountain,44.0,93.0,"This bottling is a testament to how fascinating Pinot Noir can grow after just a few years in the cellar. It shows kirsch, juniper, gingerbread and chai spice on the elegant, layered nose. The palate offers a compelling curry-like spice alongside crushed kalamata olive, eucalyptus, bay leaf and cedar flavors."
Sparkling Blend,Australia,Tasmania,Jansz,44.0,93.0,"This rivals good Champagne in its toasty, buttery-brioche richness, then adds cashew and citrus for an assertive blast of balanced flavor. Drink this fine vintage sparkler over the next 10 years or so."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Couloir,44.0,93.0,"This compelling Monument Tree Pinot offers a sauvage earthiness, layers of red cherry and blueberry fruit and a depth of character packaged deftly around its silky smooth texture. This is a knockout wine, a testament to the power of great farming and winemaking in a cool year."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Cénac,44.0,93.0,"Named after the wife of the previous owner, this top cuvée from Château de Cénac is powered by its structure and dark tannins. The rich black berries and plums are still working through the dense texture. It's a complex wine, still showing its wood aging. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Big Basin,44.0,93.0,"From 35-year-old dry farmed wines (the oldest in Corralitos) and 30% whole cluster/wild yeast fermentation comes aromas of pine pitch and blackberry jelly. The flavors are driven by sagebrush against a backdrop of deep purple fruit, with distinctive notes of juniper and eucalyptus powering the flavors from front to back."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Arista,44.0,93.0,"This delicious, compelling, full-bodied wine blends luscious fruit flavors like red cherry and boysenberry with stylish, spicy oak accents and a firm backing of acidity and tannins to keep the mouthfeel vital. The fruit and softly spicy nuances mingle beautifully and seem to melt in the mouth. It's great to drink through 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Marimar Estate,44.0,93.0,"Named for proprietor Marimar Torres' mother, the Doña Margarita Pinot is a study in cool-climate nuance and sophistication, elegant yet retaining plenty of stuffing. It is bright in wild strawberry and a decadent hint of kirsch—earthy, lithe and structured, with soft and silky tannins. On the finish is a touch of forest, as inviting as a walk in the woods."
Chardonnay,US,California,Loring Wine Company,44.0,93.0,"Complex aromas of honeysuckle, whipped butter, poached pear, baked white peach, sea salt and crushed rocks find their way into this rich, layered and yet zesty wine by Brian Loring. Ripe Gala apples meet with sea salt and slate on the palate that shows a lot of ocean influence. A slow sizzle of acidity presents more flavors of toast, vanilla and clove."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,El Coto,44.0,93.0,"Earthy, dusty plum and berry aromas are concentrated, while this mature gran reserva is still vital on the palate due to fine, crisp acidity. Classic Rioja flavors of vanilla and tobacco accent raspberry and dried cherry flavors, while the finish is mild, harmonious and full of oaky vanilla notes. Drink through 2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Fielding Hills,44.0,93.0,"Still in its shell, this wine has aromas of cocoa, vanilla, spice and dark cherries, showing a mixture of fruit and barrel. The flavors are dense, concentrated and opulent, revealing multiple layers and a hedonistic styling."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Piro,44.0,93.0,"Marc Piro broke away from his day job at Au Bon Climat to produce this first vintage of his own delicious wine. Cranberry and pomegranate aromas meld with sagebrush, thyme and peppercorn on the nose. Bright energy pops on the palate, showing cherry, cranberry, sage and bay leaf flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Talley,44.0,93.0,"Tart Mandarin orange rind is woven into riper aromas of Anjou pear and honey butter on the nose of this wine. Its palate is Chablis-like, with lime, lemon and kumquat flavors, strung from a nervy, chalky spine, finishing with limestone and gravel touches."
Chardonnay,US,California,Failla,44.0,93.0,"Caramelized apple and honey remain subtle enough to keep this wine balanced and restrained, a graceful representation of the true Sonoma Coast. From an estate vineyard, the wine shines in acidity with a mineral touch, offering a medium body with layers of crisp texture and a lingering, ripe pear-like finish."
Traminer,Austria,Burgenland,Hillinger,44.0,93.0,"The wonderfully intense acidity of this Eiswein is balanced by rich honey and fruit flavors. It has a fine line of purity and freshness, with a long, satisfying finish. Drink from 2018."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,44.0,93.0,"Made with Sangiovese, this vibrant red opens with aromas of fresh violet, woodland berry, underbrush, new leather and a balsamic note. The linear, elegant palate delivers crushed raspberry, wild cherry, star anise and a hint of white pepper. It boasts youthful tension, with taut polished tannins and bright acidity that give it an ageworthy structure. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2019–2028."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,44.0,93.0,"Pfersigberg, the hill of peach trees, is an apt name for this ripe wine. Yellow and tropical fruits show strongly along with spice, bergamot and concentration from the 50-year-old vines in the wine. The chalk soil gives a touch of minerality to the aftertaste that remains rich and full-bodied in style. Drink from 2017."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Ponzac,44.0,93.0,"This serious, ageworthy wine is the top in the series of three wines from the Moinié estate. It's powerful and perfumed, with rich dark chocolate and superripe black plum and berry flavors. The tannins are still firm, showing its considerable potential. Wait until at least 2021 before drinking."
Grenache,US,California,Big Basin,44.0,93.0,"Layers of fresh purple flowers, from lilacs to lavender, meld with dried rose petals, cinnamon, concentrated hibiscus, orange rind and black tea on the wondrous nose of this bottling. A sanguine character starts the sip before it evolves into dried strawberry and a mix of lavender, mint and thyme, framed by bright acidity and lush texture."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Domaine de Suremain,44.0,93.0,"From perhaps the best known of Mercurey's premier crus, this is a firm solid wine, dense with tannins and concentrated berry fruits. It has a ripe character that is still embedded in the tannins. That means aging and this wine should not be drunk before 2023."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Waits-Mast,44.0,93.0,"Bold, ripe fruit flavors and full body give oomph to this cherry-scented, plum-flavored wine. It tastes high on the ripeness scale, and plays its fruit chords firmly, yet it also has nice concentration and a sense of layering that are pleasures to ponder."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Ponzac,44.0,93.0,"The top wine of the trilogy made at Château Ponzac, this is designed for aging. Mint flavors from new-wood barrels mingle with dark tannins and a concentrated texture. It is a powerful, ripe wine that certainly does need some time. Don't drink before 2020."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Aaron,44.0,93.0,"Almost pitch-black in color, this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 12% Mourvèdre, 10% Syrah and 9% Grenache hits the nose with concentrated black cherries, blackberries, charred beef tips and a touch of vanilla candy. It's dense but not overly tannic on the palate, which is the flavor of blackness personified, offering blueberries, boysenberries, plum skin tartness and black tea depth."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Johann Heinrich,44.0,93.0,"An almost minty lift puts a very different spin on the blueberry fruit. The toned but concentrated palate sings with full fruit and juicy freshness, but there is a solid base with a dense, muscular texture. Tannins are ripe but the defining factor is a juicy, appetizing freshness."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Freeman,44.0,93.0,"This fragrant, concentrated wine offers vivid mint, cherry and clove aromas followed by rhubarb, red cherry and rosemary flavors that are focused and memorable. The balance is spot-on, with good acidity and velvety tannins that brace the richness of the fruit components. Best after 2022."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Baer,43.0,93.0,"Cabernet Sauvignon (65%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Merlot (15%) and equal parts Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aromas of high-toned dried herbs, flowers, black currant, coffee and barrel spices lead to densely packed black fruit flavors that need time to strut their stuff. Drink after 2021."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Numanthia,43.0,93.0,"Intense aromas of charred, smoky, lemony oak add depth and masculinity to ripe black-fruit scents. Although tough and tannic, this is built like a fortress. Flavors of black pepper, dark chocolate and blackberry finish with complex notes of cocoa and herbs. Drink this currently young and tannic Toro through 2030."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Ryan Cochrane,43.0,93.0,"Ryan Cochrane left his San Francisco advertising gig in 2009 to make wine, and this bottling is evidence he made the right move. Wild mint shrubs, dried purple violets, elderflowers and pencil shavings show on the nose. The palate is heavily spiced with sagebrush, eucalyptus and other chaparral elements found near this increasingly amazing vineyard adjacent to Highway 101."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,43.0,93.0,"Spicy orange rind and sunny tangerine notes offset steely shards of lime and mineral in this bracing, deeply concentrated Riesling. The midpalate smooths out richly, glazed by a sheen of lanolin that stretches out the finish. Drinks beautifully already, but should improve through 2020."
Red Blend,Italy,Veneto,David Sterza,43.0,93.0,"Aromas of black currant, plum cake, vanilla and mocha lead the nose on this structured, full-bodied wine. On the palate, notes of cinnamon, black pepper and nutmeg add depth to the rich blackberry and crushed plum flavors, Despite the hefty structure, it's also surprisingly elegant thanks to assertive but polished tannins and just enough fresh acidity."
Syrah,US,California,Carlisle,43.0,93.0,"The Sonoma Zinfandel house pursues a rich, opulent Rhône style in this bottling, with aromas of dark red fruit, purple florals, game and wet asphalt. It hits the palate with a Sichuan pepper-like buzz that enlivens the mouth far into the finish, with well-seasoned flavors of dried cherries, fennel and crushed Italian herbs."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,43.0,93.0,"Fresh, juicy, tart but ripe apple fruit characterizes nose and palate. This is dry and utterly appetizing, racy and fresh, yet full of that apple juiciness, made all the more lively by lemon zest notes and a hint of spicy honey. A wine that is alive through and through and still very primary. This is dry and slender and will develop. Drink 2016–2025."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de la Mordorée,43.0,93.0,"Roughly equal parts Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, this is probably Lirac's top wine at the moment. It's big and rich in the mouth, leaving behind a coating of dark fruit, hints of meaty savoriness, baking spices and softly layered wood."
Syrah,US,California,Carlisle,43.0,93.0,"Software developer-turned-vintner Mike Officer comes south from his Sonoma base to Monterey make this lavish Syrah that shows layers of blueberry, blackberry and black cassis as well as potpourri and ganache elements. Those same fruits hit the sip too, along with licorice, pretty purple flowers and an ever-increasing asphalt component."
Syrah,US,California,Carlisle,43.0,93.0,"Though from a cool region, this is a more powerful style of Syrah, showing elegant fudge and caramel notes as well as blackberries, blueberries, espresso cream and strong cola aromas. Tangy black currant and baked black-cherry fruit pop on the palate, along with tobacco, smoked beef and baking spice."
Sparkling Blend,England,England,Exton Park Vineyard,43.0,93.0,"Notions of tart redcurrant play on the nose while a delicious edge of white pepper draws you in. The same pepper entices on the palate, framing fresh, tart berry and lemon purity on the slender but memorable palate. A firm structure makes this spicy, energetic and invigorating little number irresistible. The fine mousse has verve and elegance. It finishes pure and long."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château des Jacques,43.0,93.0,"This powerful, single-vineyard wine is both fruity and structured. Dense tannins and dark cherry fruits are beautifully balanced with the wood aging. Wait to drink this wine until 2017."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château des Jacques,43.0,93.0,This single-vineyard wine is structured and dense. Powerful tannins come both from fruit and from wood aging. Underneath the black cherry fruit and fresh acidity are developing. Drink this complex wine from 2016.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de São José,43.0,93.0,"Concentrated and dense, very structured, swathed in sweet ripe plums, dark chocolate, spice and balancing acidity. This is complex, dark, while remaining stylish. For aging over 5–6 years."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Schramsberg,43.0,93.0,"You can taste the craftsmanship in this beautiful wine. The color is a brilliant light copper, the aromas and flavors remind you that the wine is made from 75% Pinot Noir, with cherry and cinnamon notes delicately coming through. A hint of fresh baked bread comes out on the palate and stays on the finish. Very tasty, and elegant in style."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Baer,43.0,93.0,"This Bordeaux-style blend is Baer's top wine. A bright bouquet of violet, berry, pepper and stone greets you at first sniff, and it gets better and better from there. Dark fruits weave through a supple and striated flavor palette, long and detailed."
Chardonnay,US,California,Marimar Estate,43.0,93.0,"Baked apple and pear laced in caramel come to mind first, evoked from the aromatics of this wine. A richness of honey beckons, too. Golden in color and creamy in texture, it's balanced by streamlined acidity that keeps it elegant and refined, moving slowly toward a lengthy, drawn-out finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Mersenne,43.0,93.0,"This tiny-production wine from a great vineyard sings in a layered perfume of roses, forest floor, pomegranate and more nuanced elements of cola and dark cherry. Bright and elegant within a substantive body, it is inviting in equal measures of plant, fruit and spice, showing tremendous taste."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,S.A. Prüm,43.0,93.0,"Primary yet deeply complex, this powerful Auslese juxtaposes intense mineral complexities against a bounty of luscious white grapefruit, yellow plum and lemon flavors. Though it feels so lithe in texture, it builds in fruit and smoky mineral tones, catapulted by a brisk line of acidity. It drinks beautifully now, but should deepen through 2025 and hold even longer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Western Australia,Vasse Felix,43.0,93.0,"This is firm, dusty and seemingly built for the cellar. Toasty, cedary and chocolaty oak frames dark fruit, yet it remains fresh in character, not dried or overripe. The finish is long, tannic and reminiscent of fine Bordeaux. Try after 2020."
Pinot Noir,England,England,Exton Park Vineyard,43.0,93.0,"A touch of honey clings to appetizingly tart red-apple fruit on the nose. The palate brings in a bright streak of lemon freshness that is both countered and enhanced by the fine, creamy mousse. Elegant litheness and an ease of touch elevate flavors to tart, crisp ripeness. The lip-smacking, pure finish reveals lovely brioche notes. Still taut and fresh, it would make a great apéritif. The wine will round out with a little bottle age. Drink 2017–2025."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,43.0,93.0,"Slate and struck flint provide a mineral-intense backdrop to pristine white grapefruit and pear flavors in this off-dry Riesling. It's just a shade off dry, with a silken, supple mouthfeel that's delightful. Drinks beautifully now but will continue to improve through 2020."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Emile Beyer,43.0,93.0,"Chalk and the merest touch of honey, a little lanolin and lots of lemon and lime peel: that describes the complex nose of this dry Riesling from the wondrous 2008 vintage. The palate is poised and dry, its lightness accentuated by the rich, stony flavors around its core. Lemon freshness runs throughout. The finish is gloriously long."
Chardonnay,US,California,Chanin,43.0,93.0,"Clean and crisp aromas of Gravenstein apples, Bartlett pear and key lime pith meet with a slight hint of smoke wafting in the background on this bottling by onetime wunderkind Gavin Chanin. The sizzling acidity presents delicate flavors of nectarine, peach and mango, with a touch of butter toward the finish. The wine steadily improves days after opening. Enjoy now through 2025."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Rijckaert,43.0,93.0,"The small village of Chânes lies in the south of the appellation, well exposed to the sun. That shows in this warm wine with its ripe apple and pear flavor. Wood aging adds richness, filling out the rich fruits with toast. This generous wine will age another year. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Silver Mountain,43.0,93.0,"Now eight years old, this Pinot Noir shines. Its aromas range from concentrated plum, earthy beet and rhubarb to balsamic vinegar and mint chip ice cream. The palate offers candied raspberry fruit, still fresh, with juniper and black tea accents that keeps one coming back for more. This wine's bottle aging allows a confluence of layers to work in harmony. The nose shows dill, black pepper, wet slate, just-ripe black cherry and pencil shavings, while the palate stacks black raspberry and blackberry fruit up against dried sagebrush and graphite. It's rich, but with enough earth and tartness to achieve balance. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Claiborne & Churchill,42.0,93.0,"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Flying Goat Cellars,42.0,93.0,"From one of the more exciting and westernmost vineyards in the region, this bottling shows earthy, gamey aromas alongside ripe red and purple fruits, pairing plum and black cherry with minty, musky herbs. The palate shows dried olive, tart orange peels, red plums, baked figs and pine needles, proving deliciously savory and intense."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Clos d'Argentine,42.0,93.0,"Smoky, charred aromas of blackberry and blackened spices set up a bold palate with energy to spare. Blackberry and cassis flavors are rich, toasty and chocolaty, while the finish on this full-bodied, ripe Malbec is lengthy and moderately complex. Drink through 2021."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,42.0,93.0,"The nose merely reveals the slightest shimmer of ripe lemon zest. The palate comes in with beautifully spicy mirabelle flavors, tempered by tangy citrus. There is lovely citrus concentration that has a zesty textural element in the streamlined body. This is wonderfully bracing, ripe and refreshing. A total joy."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Iron Horse,42.0,93.0,"Meant to showcase the producer's classic style, this is made from 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay, the lots chosen for their fruit forwardness. Succulent peach speaks quietly around bright floral aromas, while a richer undertone of hazelnut biscotti comes into play on the smooth palate."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Cakebread,42.0,93.0,"Great fruit concentration and depth give power to this full-bodied wine from Cakebread, better known for its Napa-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Not tricked up with too much oak, it tastes energized, deep and layered. Black cherry, rhubarb and cedar fan out across the palate, lingering a long time on the finish. Best from 2018."
Syrah,US,California,Carucci,42.0,93.0,"This is a cool-climate expression of Syrah from a biodynamically farmed vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills. The nose shows extreme tar, beef char, cracked black pepper and bay leaf, with gamy undertones. The tightly wound palate combines dusty elderberry with charcoal, more pepper and a lavender-rosemary flash on the finish."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Balletto,42.0,93.0,"This is a fun discovery, a tantalizing mix of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grown from estate vineyards in cool, acid-driven sites within the appellation ideal for sparkling. Light pink and gold in color, it celebrates the tangy flavors of pomegranate, strawberry and grapefruit against a mineral-laden backdrop and remarkable depth."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Mumm Napa,42.0,93.0,"Made from a majority of Pinot Noir, this reserve-tier wine lives up to its label, showing a dry swath of wild strawberry and orange preserve among a creamy center of integrated acidity and depth. It's a delight with complexity and crispness working well together."
Chardonnay,US,California,Morgan,42.0,93.0,"This is a buttery style of Chardonnay, but done deliciously. Aromas of clotted cream, browned butter, vanilla custard, sea-salt caramel, roasted almonds and cashews meet with fresh lemon and apple-blossom touches on the chalky nose. The palate is very grippy with Meyer lemon and lime pith, but then reveals creamy flavors of clarified butter on toast."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Rasi,42.0,93.0,"Winemaker Rachel Silkowski takes cues from her mentor Brian Loring in her debut wine, which is brawny and lavish with nose-ticklingly spicy aromas of cloves and nutmeg laid across black plum, olallieberry and violets. Baked black plum and black peppercorn are lifted by Christmas spices galore, from allspice to dried ginger. It's an attention grabber."
Chardonnay,US,California,Anaba,42.0,93.0,"Unctuous, with a profound sense of the salty sea, this wine is both rich and bright, balanced between crisp, defined acidity and complex depth of flavor. Lemon verbena and quince compete against a more nuanced, satisfying bite of caramelized pear as the finish refreshes."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Shane Wines,42.0,93.0,"A big, lovable Pinot Noir that is quite ripe and full of exotic fruit flavors that go beyond cherry to boysenberry and blackberry. Full-bodied, with a rounded texture and firm tannins, it is mouthfilling, generous, bombastic and delicious."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Robert Biale,42.0,93.0,"Wound tightly, this burly, brawny bruiser comes out of its shell slowly to reveal soft, perfumy notes of violet and blueberry. Flavors of dark chocolate and jam sit atop powerfully rich, dense pockets of leather and black pepper. Drink now through 2023."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,42.0,93.0,"A penetrating mineral streak cuts through layers of honeyed peach and cantaloupe in this intensely concentrated, complex Spätlese. It's lip smacking and succulently sweet, yet balanced by a zesty citrus backbone that pulses long through the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ghost Hill,42.0,93.0,"The color alone catches your attention; it's a deep, smoky sunset hue that leads into an equally captivating palate. Rich, warm and dense with cherry pastry flavors, it also brings accents of cherry tobacco, orange liqueur and a glassy minerality."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Schramsberg,42.0,93.0,"This is a beautifully made, elegant wine that combines classic aromas of toasted bread, ripe apples and almonds with mouthfilling flavors of vanilla, lemon and cream while maintaining great balance from fresh acidity. A lingering finish echoes the spices and toast."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Fort Ross,42.0,93.0,"Pleasantly pungent in ripe damson plum, this Pinot has lovely acidity, giving it a spicy mouthfeel around firmly present tannins. Full-bodied midpalate, the wine mellows through to the finish, ending in juicy fruit and earth."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,42.0,93.0,"Sumptuous aromas of white peach and pineapple are tinged with rocky mineral tones on this powerful, penetrating dry Riesling. While moderate in alcohol, it's surprisingly ripe in grapefruit and peach flavors, bolstered by a thick, mouthfilling texture."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Nelson,Neudorf,42.0,93.0,"Subtle toast and roasted cashew notes accent a wonderfully harmonious blend of stone fruit and citrus in this perennial favorite. It's medium to full in body and round without being fat or soft, long on the finish without being overly shrill or crisp. And it has a track record for aging well for up to 10 years or more."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Le Boscq,42.0,93.0,"This estate, dating to the 18th century and close to the Gironde estuary, has produced a rich wine. Young tannins and fine fruity acidity are both present in a wine that is serious and dense. Its weight, ripeness and the potential of the black-currant fruit will all allow it to age. Drink from 2022."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kessler-Haak,42.0,93.0,"This bottling's nose is earthy and hearty, with rhubarb, wild berry, tea, garrigue and a touch of game all coming into play. It's soft and creamy on the palate, with dried herb notes like thyme, marjoram and mint spicing up the plum-inflected, pleasantly rustic flavors."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kessler-Haak,42.0,93.0,"One of the winery's many estate bottlings, this offers a floral and earthy nose, with crushed slate, lavender and ginger accents to its pomegranate and mulberry aromas. It's juicy, light and acid-driven, the palate replete with cinnamon, hibiscus and grenadine flavors, followed by a thyme- and anise-inflected finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,42.0,93.0,"The nose of this dry, richly textured Riesling entices with notes of apples and pears dipped in wildflower honey. Rich and languorous, it's intensely juicy in grapefruit flavor, and finishes long, with a zesty mineral flourish."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Michele Chiarlo,42.0,93.0,"Iris, rose petal, fresh red berry and chopped mint aromas mingle together on this stunning red. The vibrant palate delivers crushed raspberry, red cherry, baking spice and star anise. Firm polished tannins provide structure and impeccable balance. Drink 2018–2028."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Gramercy,42.0,93.0,"This is an outrageously appealing wine with aromas of smoke, dried herbs and abundant peppery spices. It's sensuous and layered in feel, with generous dark fruit and black pepper flavors. It shows a profound sense of elegance, purity and detail with a finish that seems unending—a complete knee buckler."
Chardonnay,US,California,Foundry,42.0,93.0,"Grapefruit blossoms, Meyer lemon skin and faints hint of tropical, white peach-flavored crème brûlée unite for a sleek and dynamic nose on this bottling of four grape clones. Vanilla, lemon zest and flavors of limes cooked in butter show on the delicious palate."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Pichler-Krutzler,42.0,93.0,"A soft impression of ripe peach mellows the zesty concentration. The wine is still enigmatic at this point, but will open and reveal more fruit, more ripeness and even more citrus flavors. Enjoy as of 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Adams Bench,42.0,93.0,"This has lovely and deep black fruits, with smoke and toast from the barrel aging. There's a streak of caramel and a hint of coconut, good balance and length, and less obvious burn and astringency than the more recent vintages."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,J. Bookwalter,42.0,93.0,"In an effort to further differentiate the Foreshadow Merlot from the Foreshadow Cabernet, winemaker John Bookwalter has kept each out of the other's blend. This is a riveting, complex, supersized wine, with alcohol over 15% and plenty of intriguing barrel flavors. The black cherry-berry fruit is swathed in spice, chocolate, cedar and coffee, complex and well-crafted."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Presqu'ile,42.0,93.0,"Heirloom tomatoes, tomato leaf, green olives, wild berries and green peppercorns make for a very herbal though entirely compelling expression of cool climate Pinot Noir. The green-pepper and tomato character carries onto the sip, delivering a very interesting wine though one that many seeking a riper style will not enjoy."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Rizzi,42.0,93.0,"Chopped herb, fragrant blue flower, woodland berry and menthol aromas take center stage in this vibrant red. On the palate, clove and star anise notes underpin red cherry, cranberry and tobacco flavors. A hint of orange zest marks the finish while refined tannins and bright acidity provide the framework."
Syrah,US,California,Tensley,42.0,93.0,"There are expected aromas of ripe blueberry, purple flowers, peppercorns and burnt bacon on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the Sta. Rita Hills, but Joey Tensley also packs in quite a bit of herbs, with bay leaf and dried chaparral. Tightly wound flavors of dark purple fruit, beef char and coarsely ground black pepper show on the tarry sip."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Pfalz,Friedrich Becker,42.0,93.0,"Rich, ripe bramble and berry notes penetrate deeply in this silky, supple Pinot Noir. It's intensely concentrated, but brightened by a shimmering streak of acidity and fresh herbal tones. A complex, impeccably balanced wine, it finishes long with a kiss of delicate tannins."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,42.0,93.0,"This is certainly powerful, maybe too much so. It has all the richness and density of ripe and perfumed Malbec, solid with structure, with dark plums and enormous concentration. It is 100% Malbec, aged in new French oak barrels, fulfilling the brand's theme of “one family, one terroir, one grape.” No question, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,42.0,93.0,"Swathes of fresh green herbs and florals refresh tart yellow plum and peach notes in this racy, light-footed Riesling. Juicy stone fruit flavors are accented with long streaks of wax and lanolin that lend density and viscosity to the long, long finish. Gorgeous now, but likely to improve through 2025,"
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Schloss Saarstein,42.0,93.0,"Spine tingling lime and tangerine notes go head to head with sweeter apricot and yellow cherry flavors in this revitalizing sip. It's delicate in body yet deeply penetrating, filling the palate with staccato hits of honey, fruit and acidity. Drinks beautifully now but should improve through 2025."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Boekenoogen,42.0,93.0,"The dynamic nose of this bottling from a longtime ranching family in Monterey County pops with black raspberry, candied pomegranate and rose petal aromas. Fresh red fruit as well as darker baked raspberry flavors show on the palate, which is lifted by white pepper touches."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Joh. Jos. Prüm,42.0,93.0,"Savory whiffs of earth and pollen belie the bounty of luscious tangerine and stone fruit flavors that await on the palate of this delicate spätlese. It's juicy and thirst quenching yet subtle, nuanced by hits of struck flint and salt. Gossamer-fine texture and bristling acidity lend tautness. It's delicious now but should gain depth and definition through 2025."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Dr. Loosen,42.0,93.0,"This thrilling auslese starts off with intriguing spicy, musky aromas, then moves easily into flavors of pear, melon, pineapple and even red berries on the palate. It somehow comes across as plump, yet crytalline and pure, with a long, fruit-driven finish. Drink now–2030."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Burgenland,Tinhof,42.0,93.0,"A deliberately oxidized style makes for an immensely intriguing wine that falls between the usual Austrian categories—but then we need wines that defy neat boxes. Aromas of toasted cashew nuts and dried orange peel segue into a dryish, citrus-scented palate, with a central, thick slick of salted caramel and racy acidity. The longer you taste, the more facets appear, even as the palate fades into notions of salty, candied mandarin zest. Unusual and uncategorisable, but unforgettable. Despite being called Apéritif, it might be best with cheese and tapas."
Petite Sirah,US,California,MCV,42.0,93.0,"Deep plum and sweet tobacco leaf aromas mesh with sour and candied blueberry in this layered and luxurious wine from Petite Sirah specialists MCV. The palate is pleasantly broad, with chocolate and smoked cactus flavors, reminiscent of tequila. Both the tannins and acidity are proper and smooth."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Bellevue,42.0,93.0,"A dark and dense wine that has solid tannins and tight, juicy acidity. Its texture is very mineral, firm, complex and still needing to age. From a single vineyard in Morgon, it offers the powerful side of a Beaujolais cru, powered both by fruit and by structure. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Owen Roe,42.0,93.0,"This wine lives and breathes terroir, with the rock and wild herb character of the AVA and the vivid cherry fruit of the vineyard. It's beautifully proportioned, with a vein of cola, a toasty bouquet and a focused finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Balletto,42.0,93.0,"This estate-grown wine is tart and tangy, with a backbone of enviable structure. Orange citrus adds an illusion of heightened acidity that balances the burly tannins that give strength and power. Red cherry and pomegranate round out savory clove and black tea on the way to an earthy finish. Drink now through 2023."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Boeckel,42.0,93.0,"This beautiful wine is already so balanced and ripe. Rich tropical and yellow fruits are lightly spiced and given a lift with the acidity. Along with that, it offers a more complex texture and mineral character. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Boekenoogen,42.0,93.0,"This dry-farmed portion of the exciting family-owned estate delivers aromas of cardamom, pomegranate extract, cherry juice, ollallieberry, sweet woods and the yeastiness of a baking croissant. The palate shows cherry pie, pulverized cloves, star anise and more yeast, with a very full mouthfeel and silky tannins."
Chardonnay,US,California,Morgan,42.0,93.0,"This excellent, restrained bottling is compelling. Lemongrass, kaffir lime and lemon-lime aromas lead into a palate laced with fresh, high-toned citrus notes. More exotic touches of sweet onion, yuzu and wet slate complete the experience."
Syrah,US,California,Austin Hope,42.0,93.0,"Aromas of lavender and ripe dark fruit abound on the nose, while forest floor and pine tar add nuance. The flavors are full of deep plum and black cherry, wrapped around an elegant butter-herb sauce quality."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Geyerhof,42.0,93.0,"With a very slight spritz, this offers lots of zesty flavors that create a savory midpalate amid white pepper and yeast. Riper hints of green and yellow pear await in the background. There is immense concentration on the palate, which finishes almost with a kind of saltiness."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Balletto,42.0,93.0,"In 2012, Balletto had its Pinots undergo natural fermentations, with beguiling results. This vintage of Burnside Road, always a standout bottling, delivers stemmy, herbal, toasty aromas around a layering of warm strawberry fruit and gorgeous earthiness. Soft, silky and seductive, it lingers on the tongue, imprinting on the pleasure centers of the brain."
Red Blend,US,California,Pianetta,42.0,93.0,"The awesome nose of this wine is redolent with barbecue sauce, or perhaps a hickory-laced plum sauce, and it's incredibly distinctive if a little bizarre. The palate is full and rich with a similar saucy character, but also shows more complex notes of lush blackberries, rose hips and licorice."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kessler-Haak,42.0,93.0,"There's compelling balance between the baked red cherry fruit, graphite-like minerality and brown spice on the nose of this bottling, further enhanced by leather and earth aromas. Bright raspberry meets with cooked strawberry and licorice flavors on the palate, where a somewhat frothy texture is powered by acidity atop soft yet somewhat structuring tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Stevens,42.0,93.0,"The sixth release of this outstanding reserve holds firm to the well-established style. Bright, tart, ripe and compact red-berry fruit is set against firm, polished tannins. Still young and hard, it needs plenty of breathing time, or better yet, cellar it for a few years. Tim Stevens's reds have proven ageworthy, and this earthy, smoky, textural and well-crafted effort should improve for a decade or more."
Grenache-Syrah,US,Washington,Dominio IV,42.0,93.0,"While the notes of raspberry jam, plum and herbs bring plenty of appeal, it's the velvety soft, plush texture that truly dazzles on this fresh, fruit-filled wine that has a high yum factor."
Syrah,US,California,Anglim,42.0,93.0,"Layers of violets and blackberry paste make for an inviting nose that combines elegantly dark fruit and boisterous florality. There is a dense boysenberry core to the palate, edged by chocolate, dried mint, cola and licorice flavors, altogether very approachable and pleasant."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Proidl,42.0,93.0,"The nose already hints at the concentration of the palate, which hits like a bullet of spice and fruit, of pepper and pear. This is compact and fresh and given a wonderful and welcome drive by grapefruit zest. The finish is of aromatic pear and tingling white pepper and generous but well-directed ripeness."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,42.0,93.0,"Full in the mouth, this is a warm style of wine. It has weight, ripeness and fruitiness with abundant apricot and pear flavors. It is enjoyable now although it will certainly age well. Drink until 2022."
Syrah,US,Washington,Lawrelin,42.0,93.0,"This project aimed to show how well Washington wines can age and the proof is in the bottle. Aromas are complex, with notes of dried cranberry, cherry, leather, black tea, cocoa and mushroom. The palate is packed with rich fruit flavors that show no signs of slowing down. It flat-out impresses."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Goat Bubbles,42.0,93.0,"Regional bubbly pioneer Norm Yost manages to coax stunning aromas and unique flavors from his sparkling wines. In this example, the nose offers pear cider and corn laced with lime and apple aromas. That cider element comes into play on the palate as well, where mulling spices blend with dried ginger for a full and intriguing sip."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Abeja,42.0,93.0,"In this warm, ripe, lush and forward vintage, winemaker John Abbott has outdone himself. This is immediately appealing, sending a rush of black cherry and cassis fruit backed with darker notes of coffee, smoke and licorice. The flavors are dense and supple, and the wine combines grace and power, unfolding with additional layers of tar, green tea and smoky herb."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Joh. Jos. Prüm,42.0,93.0,"Intensely earthy notes of honey and wax, and just the faintest whiff of petrol, are enticing precursors of maturity within an otherwise delightfully fresh, fruity Riesling. It's delicately crisp on the palate, but ends with a long, lanolin-coated finish."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,42.0,93.0,"One barrel of each of Trisaetum's three estate vineyards contributed to this reserve bottling. It's the most closed of their dry Rieslings, requiring a hearty decant to show its stuffing: tart apple and citrus fruit, with streaks of vanilla and spice. Or age it a few years longer to allow more nuances to emerge."
Champagne Blend,France,Champagne,Nicolas Feuillatte,42.0,93.0,"From the excellent 2008 vintage, this is a very complete, ripe wine. It is rich, packed with crisp white fruits that are developing into a structured, concentrated wine with a great future. The balance between acidity and dosage is just right. Drink ideally from 2018."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Villa Sandi,42.0,93.0,"This gorgeous sparkler offers enticing scents of white stone fruit and spring flower. Vibrant and silky, the smooth elegant, palate delivers crisp apple, creamy white peach and juicy nectarine set against bright acidity and an ultrarefined perlage."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Joh. Jos. Prüm,42.0,93.0,"Ripe and rich, this irresistibly fruity spätlese is concentrated with peach marmalade, guava and grapefruit flavors, but braced by a streak of lemon-lime acidity and a delicate spritz that tickles the palate. Satisfying and juicy, it finishes long with a hint of grapefruit-pith astringency."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stadt Krems,42.0,93.0,"Gentle fruit notes hint at yellow pear, cantaloupe melon and ripe apricot. On the palate, the fruit develops real drive and is edged by the yeasty spice so typical of Grüner, accentuated by appetizing apple tartness and citric lift. The more you savor, the more this gives."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Lemelson,42.0,93.0,"Although the Chestnut Hill selection from Lemelson remained stubbornly hard and tight after opening, it rewarded extra patience with added depth and polish. The red fruits showed the most concentration of all the 2009s from this producer, and oak accents of cinnamon and toast were beautifully integrated. A seamless middle and exceptional length mark this wine as one to cellar."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de Tiregand,42.0,93.0,"Tiregand has long been the big name in Pécharmant. Although the estate fell behind, it seems now to have managed to use a traditional approach to create a impressive wines. This wood-aged wine, with its mint aromas and dense yet elegant tannins, is a good case in point. Wait for 5–6 years before drinking."
Syrah,US,Washington,Proper,42.0,93.0,"The aromas on this Rocks District wine pop with huckleberry, black and green olive, plum and mineral. It's dazzlingly polished and textured in feel, with nuanced, detailed smoked meat and savory flavors. It nonetheless retains an exquisite sense of balance and restraint, capped off by an outrageously long finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),42.0,93.0,"Subdued crushed stone and smoke aromas ease into a dramatically riper, richer palate full of lush tropical mango and melon flavors here. It's a deeply penetrating wine with scintillating lightness and a spine of tingling acidity. Gorgeous already but concentrated enough to improve through 2025."
Malbec,US,Oregon,Abacela,42.0,93.0,"The winery notes that this is their 16th vintage of Malbec, but just the first reserve bottling. Intense aromatics introduce a wine saturated with black fruits, coffee liqueur, soy and tobacco. It offers exceptional depth and power. Drink now through 2025."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin,42.0,93.0,"This is a balanced wine with touches of honey and toast, along with ripe yellow and white fruits that are cut by a salty structure. Great acidity runs through the wine, giving a tight, steely, very pure aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Marchiori & Barraud,42.0,93.0,"This is not your average power-packed Malbec. Opening scents of meaty, wild berry fruits are feral and interesting, and also quite bold. A layered, deep palate shows purity, black-fruit flavors and oaky additions of chocolate, spice and pepper. A dark, minty, spicy finish is fiery, so drink cautiously through 2023."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Baden,Franz Keller,42.0,93.0,"Rich succulent black cherry and berry notes mingle with swathes of ripe bramble and dried sage in this bold full-bodied Pinot Noir. Unabashedly luscious and fringed by a feathery fray of tannins, its forward but refined nature is appealing now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Dunning Vineyards,42.0,93.0,"Incredibly rich blackberry-jam aromas meet with licorice, smoked beef and black rocks on the continually evolving and dynamic nose of this bottling from Paso Robles' west side. It's rich, juicy and expertly structured on the palate, where blackberry fruit meets with pencil-lead minerality and light espresso flavors. The tannic grip is solid and the acidity is strong, ensuring long ageability."
Chardonnay,US,California,Vermeil,42.0,93.0,"Dark gold in color and intensely cradled in oak, this wine maintains a balance of complex, well-defined flavors of honey and apple, with lurking minerality that keeps it fresh and lively. It's lush and yet layered, a complete package. Drink now through 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Gallegos,42.0,93.0,"Black raspberry and wet black slate are most prevalent on the nose of this wine from one of the appellation's most reliable vineyards, but it also shows an ample amount of black spices, from cardamom to star anise. The palate is also gravelly with earth, enhanced by purple berries, Earl Grey tea and lavender flavors."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Proidl,42.0,93.0,"Fresh citrus has a tang of green apple on the nose. The palate colors this with an equally zesty dollop of grapefruit, but something riper, richer, almost of dried fruit, also swings in there. This is intriguing and fresh, zesty and taut, lip-smacking and moreish. I feel that this will give up its secrets with a little more bottle age, but it already is delicious now."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,42.0,93.0,"A whiff of smoked nuts lends savory complexity to bright tangerine, pineapple and white floral aromas in this gorgeously steel-toned wine. Dry and minera, yet silken in texture, it hits the palate with staccato notes of crunchy stone fruit, lemon and lime. It's bracing and brisk now but should meld beautifully over the next decade."
Syrah,US,California,Lost Blues,42.0,93.0,"Savory pepper and raw-beef notes mark on the nose of this tightly wound bottling, as well as nut brittle and teriyaki aromas. Plum skins, lavender and carpaccio show on the sip alongside a wash of flowers and herbs, from lavender to rosemary. The tannins are mouthcoating and need time to develop. Drink 2018–2028."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Gramercy,42.0,93.0,"This is modeled on southern Rhône blends—a fairly straightforward mix of 85% Syrah and 15% Grenache. Grainy and smoky, with a slight charred aspect, this focused effort displays deep pomegranate fruit, soaked in soy, balsamic and other umami notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Sextant,42.0,93.0,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling, which includes a bit of the other main Bordeaux varietals, shows concentrated blueberries, blackcurrant, cola and fudges notes on the nose. It's soft and rich on the palate, with fine-grained tannins revealing more dense, dark fruit, touches of mint and chocolate, and a nice floral component."
Viognier,US,California,Pride Mountain,42.0,93.0,"A lovely 100% Viognier fermented and aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak, this wine opens with come-hither aromas of night-blooming jasmine and white flowers, evolving in the glass into a bright, viscous expression of honey and almond. Concentrated yet lively, it's a beautiful wine."
Pinot Noir,US,California,La Follette,42.0,93.0,"Tangy, juicy, fresh and fun, this vineyard-designate, a consistent star in this producer's arsenal, is densely layered, supported by an oak structure. Black plum, black cherry and raspberry cross paths to offer a spark of ripe fruit before succumbing to several shakes of Asian spice."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Rexford,42.0,93.0,"Rose petals, hibiscus and shaved cinnamon show on the nose of this wine by a father and son team. The palate is sleek and tight with pomegranate, cranberry and sour cherry on the fruit end, as well as sage, lingering eucalyptus and a flash of cola on the spice side."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,42.0,93.0,"From a vineyard planted in 1981 above Cupertino comes this cellar-ready bottling that shows tobacco, cigar box, loamy earth, dried plums, leather deep black cherry and blueberry on the nose. Zesty acidity and chalky tannins frame the complete and powerful palate, where flavors of cedar, tobacco and woody berries converge. Drink 2020 through 2033."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sojourn,42.0,93.0,"A blend of several vineyard sites, including Riddle and Pratt, this is a knockout, a testament to fine winemaking in its soft, velvety texture and buoyant acidity and structure. Orange and strawberry provide a tangy ripeness complemented in earth and clove. This is one worth stocking up on."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Flying Goat Cellars,42.0,93.0,"A bit of bottle age always makes for a more compelling Pinot Noir, in this case showing kirsch, clove, leather and turned earth on the nose. There is a richness to the palate, full of black cherry and fig flavors, as well as an earthy undercurrent of thyme, anise and eucalyptus that rises toward the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,42.0,93.0,"From a vineyard planted in 1981 in the hills above what became Silicon Valley, this shows soy sauce, sesame, black olive, dill, beef jerky and the darkest of black fruits on the nose. The palate continues the Asian flavor theme, with teriyaki, Chinese five spice and hoisin sauce as well as blueberry paste, dusty leather and crushed rocks, framed by strong structure and bright acidity. Drink 2017–2027."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Gramercy,42.0,93.0,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of red fruit, plum, assorted herbs and high-toned spices. The red fruit flavors are pure and layered, bringing a whole lot of hedonistic pleasure while showing exquisite balance."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Cerro Prieto,42.0,93.0,"This wine possesses a dense core of concentrated raspberry fruit on the nose, but not in a jammy way, further entertained by fluffier rose petals, cherry blossoms and a drizzle of vanilla syrup. The high-toned, vibrant palate is also rich in restrained sour raspberry fruit, spiced with a clove cream, making the mouth sing."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Dr. Loosen,42.0,93.0,"This wine boasts a great combination of sweetness and richness with elegance and finesse. Aromas are honeyed and floral yet minerally, while the flavors run toward pears and peaches steeped in honey. The finish is undeniably rich, but supercharged by a lively skein of citrusy acids."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Josmeyer,41.0,93.0,"A touch of flint flashes up briefly before fruity notes of ripe juicy apricot and peach take over. On the palate they are joined by a flash of lemon freshness that brightens and heightens the slender but concentrated palate. Lemon and peach, tangerine and mirabelle fill mouth and mind while the freshness blows away any sensory cobwebs. This is deeply satisfying, lovely now but sure to improve. Drink now through 2030."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Baer,41.0,93.0,"Baer's Arctos blend is about three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, and here the grape shows less fat, and more structure than in the previous vintage. It's a better wine, sleek and yet fruity, with a pleasing mix of blackberry and cassis. The tannins are forceful, herbal, and sturdy, giving the finish a firm spine. The grace notes of clove and coffee and loam continue to add interest as the wine lingers through a dense finish."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Château de Lavernette,41.0,93.0,"Produced in a small, 1.5-acre vineyard, this wine is named after a Boissieu ancestor from the 18th century. It is a rich wine, beautifully perfumed and with a rich, lightly wooded texture that shines with yellow fruits and juicy acidity. It is still young and really should age. Drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,41.0,93.0,"Subdued, ripe, yellow pear meets yeasty, almost soy-like savoriness head-on to create a palate full of interest. The wine conveys weight, concentration and a bit of alcoholic heat, but it's all carried of with peppery panache. Lovely now but will only get better."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Paul Blanck,41.0,93.0,Damask rose and honeysuckle on the nose almost have a cotton-candy tang to them. The palate is medium sweet and adds peach compote to the floral notes and a dollop of plump luscious sweetness. There is huge concentration and big aromatic intensity on the midpalate with a lovely bitter edge that lasts long. There is a medium-sweet finish.
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Waipara Valley,Pegasus Bay,41.0,93.0,"Peg Bay is the flagship winery of Waipara, yet the wines remain realistically priced. Plum, cola and cherry notes are accompanied by strongly umami sensations akin to mushroom and roasted beef, giving this wine ample complexity. While the wine is concentrated, it has an airy, graceful feel to it. Drink 2016–2024."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Josmeyer,41.0,93.0,"Aromatic notions suggest Bosc pear, the ripe peel of Navel oranges, the crunch of apple—all conveying perfect ripeness countered with freshness. This wine is refreshing and full fruited and yet rounded. It's a harmoniously balanced, dry wine of total freshness."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Salentein,41.0,93.0,"Salentein's wines have never been better than over the last few vintages. This Malbec-heavy blend is rich, with aromatic notes of raisin, prune, licorice and almond candy. A full, tannic and slightly bumpy palate holds impressive flavors of cassis, black plum, blackberry, toast and peppercorn. On the finish, coffee, toast, mocha, licorice and cassis flavors are deep and delicious. Drink through 2026."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Schramsberg,41.0,93.0,"A very light-colored wine made from dark grapes, this is a detailed and multilayered beauty. Fresh ginger, cinnamon and brioche aromas lead to an elegant texture and vivid fruit flavors like white cherry and raspberry that energize the palate and linger long on the finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Mas de Cadenet,40.0,93.0,"Named after the Negrel family, owners of the estate, this is the top cuvée in their range. Aging in wood gives it a surprising series of flavors ranging from caramel to spice to buttery toast. While some of the fruit is lost along the way, the wine has a rounded, very complete character that is rich and made for food."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sanctuary,40.0,93.0,"Winemaker Dennis Martin puts grape grower Stephen Miller's signature on this wine, a nod to the importance of this historic vineyard. The wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry with touch of savory wood smoke as well as hibiscus-laced pastry and a pinch of thyme. Earthy sagebrush and wild herb flavors frame the palate, where cooked cherries and cranberries are spiced by cardamom and dried ginger spice."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Westerly,40.0,93.0,"Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend. The palate is also rich and powerful, its thick mouthfeel showing black cherry, cocoa, vanilla and a touch of asphalt. A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tour Grand Faurie,40.0,93.0,"This smooth, rich and fine wine is maturing well. It has a good balance of ripe fruit and acidity. Bitter coffee and spice notes add complexity while not detracting from the fruit. Drink from 2020."
Red Blend,US,California,White Hart Wine,40.0,93.0,"Extreme concentration combined with a velvety texture make this inky-dark wine made from Tannat and Dornfelder compelling to taste. The color is black with a thin ruby rim while black cherry, cedar and tobacco fill the aroma and crème de cassis meets espresso on the palate. The mouthfeel is polished as very fine-grained tannins blend with a rich viscosity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,40.0,93.0,"Sagemoor's old Cab vines comprise 79% of the blend. The rest is a mix of Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, melded into a deep and satisfying whole. Beautifully mixed cassis, berry and cherry fruits are dotted with dried herb. There is plenty of caramel and toast in the lingering finish, and this wine combines hedonistic power with depth and character."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Louis Sipp,40.0,93.0,"Mango aromas drive this rich wine, full of honey as well as spicy fruits. It is not so much weighty as intense, with a sense of warmth. Now mature and ready to drink, it still retains a youthful fruit character."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Orfila,40.0,93.0,"This winery northeast of San Diego sources from up north and experiments heavily with stem inclusion on this bottling, which shows cherry blossoms, crushed cranberries and an earthy line of anise through the nose. Plush purple fruit flavors of olallieberry and boysenberry power the medium-bodied palate, with sage and peppercorn spice throughout."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,John Duval Wines,40.0,93.0,"This is another top-flight example of how good the 2012 vintage was for South Australian Shiraz. The oak here is so subtle as to not factor into the wine's scents of raspberry and cracked pepper. Hints of spice and vanilla mark the palate, gently accenting red berry fruit before ending in a flood of silky tannins. Drink now–2030."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Trimbach,40.0,93.0,"As the wine ages, it shows a soft, toasty and nutty side that adds complexity to the tight fruitiness that remains. It's a wine in transition, still fresh while adding some concentration, broadening the steely texture and giving hints of the serious wine it will be. Drink from 2018."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Amalie Robert,40.0,93.0,"Minute quantities of these rare Viogniers are produced, which is a shame, because they are distinctive and enlightening. Deep gold and intensely aromatic with brilliant floral notes, this is a beautifully balanced wine, with the acidity and skin flavors to put a crisp frame around the ripe peach and apricot fruit."
Spätburgunder,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,40.0,93.0,"Hints of bramble and mint meld into fresh black cherries and violets in this very pretty, profoundly aromatic Pinot Noir. It's elegantly composed yet richly concentrated, finishing amidst a lingering spray of lavender blossoms and herbs."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Senses,40.0,93.0,"Softly seductive, this structured, juicy Pinot hails from two Occidental-based vineyards, Hillcrest and Tanuda, each equally cool and close to the Pacific Ocean. Wild berry, cherry and anise shine brightly around earthy undertones and a finish of cardamom. This is a delicious, restrained and elegant wine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wine & Soul,40.0,93.0,"This is the second wine from the Pintas vineyard in the heart of the Pinhão valley. It's powered by mint, dark plums and new wood flavors to give a richly concentrated, juicy wine. It's still young, showing all its initial fruitiness, and those tannins and acidity will need several years. Drink from 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Laurel Glen,40.0,93.0,"Blended with 10% Merlot, this wine sources grapes both from its famous estate, as well as from nearby Pickberry and Murray vineyards. It delights in luxuriously bright acidity and a jammy explosion of blackberry, chocolate, clove and tobacco, the texture roundly approachable."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Comartin,40.0,93.0,"There's lovely vibrancy to the nose of this bottling, with tangy cranberry, hibiscus and strawberry aromas, yet those are deftly cut by peppercorns, brown spice and turned earth. The mouthfeel is engagingly peppery, with spicy bay leaf and thyme herbs, a touch of cured Kalamata olives and an underlying, underripe raspberry and cranberry fruit base."
Chardonnay,US,California,Ram's Gate,40.0,93.0,"Dark gold in color, this appellation wine is tropical and salty, medium bodied with a strong taste of lemon preserves. Its fuller, richer nature is complemented by fresher streaks of grapefruit and mandarin, with a mineral component of wet stone."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Spain,Central Spain,Marques de Griñon,40.0,93.0,"Highly concentrated black-fruit aromas of plum and currant are made more interesting by cola and forest-floor notes. This is a dense, chewy and almost fat Cabernet Sauvignon. Baked berry, fig and savory grilled-meat flavors are massive, backed up by a lush, deep finish. Drink 2018–2025."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Durfort-Vivens,40.0,93.0,"The second wine from the biodynamic estate of Durfort-Vivens, this is a deliciously ripe fruity wine, dominated by 82% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a crisp accessible character that will allow it to age relatively quickly. The wine has juicy acidity, red-berry fruits and final acidity. Drink from 2019."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,G D Vajra,40.0,93.0,"Enticing aromas of wild berry, pine forest, aromatic herbs, iris and a hint of leather emerge on this full-bodied red. The bold, chewy palate delivers crunchy red berry, anise white pepper, clove and sage alongside youthfully assertive tannins and bright acidity. The ripe fruit seamlessly supports the hefty alcohol level."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Gérard Fiou,40.0,93.0,"The flint soil of the Fiou domaine has given a magnificent rich wine. Yellow fruits, ripe citrus and beautifully perfumed acidity all contribute to a wine that is packed with flavor. The fruit is still crisply fresh and the mineral texture from the soil shows how well it will age. Drink from 2017."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Coussin,40.0,93.0,"The bottle carries the signature of French sculptor César, who marked his friendship with the Sumeire family, owners of the estate. The wine, the top cuvée of the property, is impressively rich while still being beautifully balanced and fresh. From selected parcels, it is a real food wine, tense with a good texture and a ripe, concentrated aftertaste."
Grenache,US,California,Margerum,40.0,93.0,"Light and crystalline in the glass, this snappy bottling shows ripe cranberry fruit, thyme and composting violets on the dynamic nose. Though very lightweight on the palate, it delivers waves of raspberry, hibiscus and spicy cinnamon flavors, revealing how layered and vivid that a fresh and bright expression of Grenache can be."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Gaudou,40.0,93.0,"A dark, dense wine that comes from a parcel of old vines. It's a solid, supremely tannic wine at this young stage, but that black fruitiness will push through over the next few years. Great swathes of juicy acidity, tannins and fruit, all impressive potential. Drink from 2018."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Domaine de Cause,40.0,93.0,"This wood-aged, perfumed wine is serious, complex and will take its time to develop. It is full of dark tannins and ripe black fruits, laced with acidity. It comes from old vines, planted in the 1970s, which give great concentration and depth to the wine. It will be ready to drink from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Gérard Fiou,40.0,93.0,"Still young, this rich, lightly honeyed and intensely ripe wine is beautifully structured. It has swathes of apricot, citrus and gooseberry fruits as well as a dense concentrated texture. The wine is certainly in need of aging. Drink from 2019."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tenuta delle Terre Nere,40.0,93.0,"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, French oak, clove and a whiff of aromatic herb lift out of the glass. The structured palate offers black cherry, cinnamon, licorice, menthol and chopped mint alongside vibrant acidity and youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins that grip the finish. Give this time to fully develop and unwind. Drink 2020–2029."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tenuta delle Terre Nere,40.0,93.0,"Graphite, grilled herb, toast and leather aromas emerge together with a balsamic note. Showing structure and finesse, the full-bodied palate delivers mature black cherry, raspberry, licorice, coffee, toasted oak and a hint of Asian spice. Firm, fine-grained tannins grip the finish. Drink 2020–2029."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,La Chablisienne,40.0,93.0,"This Premier Cru vineyard lies north of the Grand Crus, with a west-facing exposure. It has yielded a wine with soft, generous floral character, ripe yellow fruit and a crisp, mineral edge. Finely sculpted and ageworthy, it will be best from 2019."
Champagne Blend,France,Champagne,Baron-Fuenté,40.0,93.0,"A blend of three vintages, this impressive wine from the southern Champagne vineyards of the Aube has both crisp fruit and maturity from bottle aging. It's ripe with sliced apple fruit and plenty of citrus. Drink now."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,40.0,93.0,"A golden color and a nose of honeyed evolution, reminiscent of fresh field mushrooms and chalk already hint at a vintage wine. The palate surprises with the most gentle, generous and balmy fruit, like an essence of peach, without resorting to any sweetness added by dosage. Its fruity freshness is truly astonishing. This is an evolved, gloriously fresh testament to what Crémant d'Alsace can be. This might work better alongside food than as an apéritif. In any case: let it speak to you and savor the long finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Harper Voit,40.0,93.0,"Smoky, chewy and dense, this is stacked with plum and black-cherry fruit. Strong streaks of cola and dark chocolate add complexity, with lightly dusty tannins supporting the extended finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Michaud,40.0,93.0,"Dark hibiscus and pomegranate notes meet with black plum, hearty clove, allspice and dried violets on the nose of this very heady wine. Thickly structured with dense tannins on the palate, it speaks strongly of the rocky, rugged appellation, with boysenberry, dried fennel and wild-thyme flavors. Drink 2017–2023."
Port,US,California,Williams Selyem,40.0,93.0,"Dark and viscous, this greets the nose with expected aromas of raisin and prune, but rises above with nutmeg, cardamom, clove and sleek graphite notes. The first impression on the palate is sweet plum nectar, but the grippy tannins prove seductive and the ripping acidity keeps it quaffable. The fascinating finish is all about chocolate-covered nuts."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,40.0,93.0,"Ripe luscious pear fruit almost has a touch of maple syrup on the nose. The palate, which still has ample carbon dioxide from the fermentation for a little fizz, is light and fresh, lemony and bouncy, alive with a kind of earthy goodness. It is the lemon that lasts longest on the dry refreshing palate and makes for a lip-smacking finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,Gramercy,40.0,93.0,"Les Collines, Minick, Old Stones, SJR, Oldfield and Olsen provide the fruit for this wine. It's perfumed and leads with aromas of violets, dried herbs, olive and earth, with raspberry notes emerging over time. The palate is all about texture and elegance, while lingering on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Michaud,40.0,93.0,"Pressed cranberry, underripe raspberry and white pepper form the alluring aromatic base for this bottling that dives into Kalamata olive and cardamom notes on the nose. There is great energy on the sip, with anise, buzzy Sichuan peppercorn and Indian spice enlivening the tomato leaf and cherry-tomato fruit."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Kaleidos,40.0,93.0,"This blend of 64% Syrah, 26% Grenache and 10% Mourvèdre is unabashedly rich and lush, with cassis, vanilla, baked pastry, white chocolate, brown sugar and caramelized pork fat on the nose. Fudge, caramel and vanilla show powerfully on the sip, which will pair with a juicy steak or simply wow everyone at the table, even toward the end of a long night."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Olivier Rivière,40.0,93.0,"Here's another raring red from Bordeaux-born Rivière that needs time to settle. Ripe aromas are all about fruit, while this wine is clamping on the palate, with a sense of skins one hopes will resolve with time. Peppery plum and wild berry flavors finish with cheek-grabbing tannins and lasting toastiness. Drink 2019–2035."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,40.0,93.0,"The Nussberg vineyard towering above the western edge of Vienna is famed for its field blend Gemischter Satz (mixed varieties). Fritz Wieninger has produced a wine that perfectly balances opulence with minerality. Rich fruits march with citrus and finish with structure, and the potential to age."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Phillips Hill,40.0,93.0,"Sometimes a blend of vineyards like this one can equal or surpass the single-vineyard bottlings. This complex and well-rounded wine achieves a good balance between seductive fruit flavors and more subtle, woodsy, savory nuances from whole-cluster fermentation, while not going over-the-top in body or oakiness. Each sip uncovers more spice, more cedar and more subtlety."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wine & Soul,40.0,93.0,"In the Val de Mendiz, half way up the Pinhão Valley, Sandra Tavares da Silva and Jorge Serôdio Borges have crafted a range of three wines that are magnificent. This is the middle wine, produced from old field-blend vines. Despite its weight, the wine is packed with fruit and shows considerable freshness. It does however need to age, so don't drink before 2018."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Vasse Felix,40.0,93.0,"Winemaker Virginia Willcock's latest effort shows that top-flight Margaret River Chardonnay doesn't have to cost three figures. This is fine stuff, a bit funky at first, but opening up in the glass to reveal hints of brown-sugar-glazed pineapple and fresh citrus. It's medium to full in body, with a long, almost painfully crisp finish that brings all that fruit into bright, refreshing focus."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Launa,40.0,93.0,"Piercing minerality with pure plum and berry aromas greet you on a rock-solid bouquet. This thoroughbred Rioja is racy and juicy, with inky black fruit flavors over subdued oak. A muscular and minty finish is full of verve and potential. Drink from 2016 through 2026."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Balboa,40.0,93.0,"Named for a favored surf spot in Mexico, Sayulita is a new project from Balboa. This first release, from the Lefore vineyard, is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Syrah, a perfect mix and showcase for the strengths of both. Soft and smooth, it's tightly woven with veins of earth, pepper, black olive, coffee, black fruits and licorice."
Syrah,Chile,Marchigue,Polkura,40.0,93.0,"This block-selection Syrah is a kissing cousin of Polkura's more basic yet excellent Syrah from Marchigue in western Colchagua. It shows plenty of oak, vanilla and black-fruit ripeness, but on the palate it's nicely balanced and runs a mile deep. Toasty, smoky blackberry flavors end with mocha notes and oomph. Drink through 2019."
Chardonnay,US,California,Byron,40.0,93.0,"Seared lemon, hazelnut, brown butter and sandalwood with a graphite minerality come through on the nose of this complex wine from Jonathan Nagy. The palate offers hints of herbs and chamomile at first, then washes of citrusy acidity and apple notes, all held together with steely tension."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut-Bergey,40.0,93.0,"A truly grassy aroma leads to a fresh, herbaceous and crisp wine. To top its crispness, it also has some weight, wood flavors and a creamy core with a white pear texture. It could benefit from aging, at least three years, to bring out the inherent richness of the wine."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Tegernseerhof,40.0,93.0,"Martin Mittelbach rolls out this intense, concentrated wine, which packs spice, ripe pineapple and apricots and a final floral character that fills the mouth. A wine to age for at least four years. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sandler,40.0,93.0,"This extended skin contact experiment from winemaker Ed Kurtzman was a success, its chamomile, lime and meringue-like scents framed by chalky minerality on the nose. The palate is tightly wound with saffron, lemon peel and grapefruit touches upheld by a persistent acidity that seemingly crescendoes on the finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Other,Aguijón De Abeja,40.0,93.0,"While this is immensely oaky on the nose, that wood and char works because it comes with ripe cassis, blackberry and raisin scents. Chewy, ultraripe and tannic on the palate, this tastes of sweet black fruits, chocolaty oak and wood. An oaky reprise is front and center on a grabby stacked finish. Drink through 2023."
Pinot Noir,US,California,J Vineyards & Winery,40.0,93.0,"From estate-grown fruit dotted around the appellation, this wine shines in a fresh approach to tannin and savory-laced black cherry, seasoning it with clove, earth and black tea. Its length impresses, with the finish vibrantly spiked with cardamom and cola spice."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Tondré,40.0,93.0,"Cinnamon and clove show alongside hibiscus and mulberry on the distinctive nose of this bottling that also offers hints of maple, juniper, eucalyptus and turned earth. It's soft on the sip with elegant tannins and flavors of black cherry, cherry tomato, anise and camphor on the finish."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Wakefield,40.0,93.0,"This is a ripe Clare Valley Riesling, but it balances its peachy overtones with powerful citrus zest and hints of crushed stone. There's a touch of roundness to the midpalate, then plenty of length on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Von Schleinitz,40.0,93.0,"Equal parts earth and fruit, this full-bodied Riesling offers loads of penetrating melon, citrus and honey flavors offset by delicate tones of saffron and dusty mineral. Dry in style and struck by exhilarating acidity, it offers exceptional balance and complexity."
Chardonnay,US,California,Ramey,40.0,93.0,"Decadent aromas of golden pear and Tahitian vanilla rise to the top of this incredibly well-crafted wine, a blend of multiple vineyard sources, most of them single-vineyard designated in other wines. Steely minerality buoys the overall experience, with a touch of vanilla custard. The wine is rich on the aroma yet balanced in taste, with a finishing accent of orange blossom."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Cenay,40.0,93.0,"From a vineyard within the Oak Knoll District, this Bluetooth is musky and chewy in all the right ways, complex and feral in crisp red fruit and red licorice. The majority Cabernet Sauvignon is softened somewhat by the addition of 5% Merlot, providing a juicy undercurrent beneath firm, generous tannins. Cellar through 2022."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Senses,40.0,93.0,"Harmony and balance are the hallmarks of this full-bodied and vibrant wine in which everything seems well woven together. It smells like bright cherry, cinnamon and cloves, and tastes brisk and tangy like red cherries. A velvety texture complements the brightness of the fruit flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lafond,40.0,93.0,"Scents of chamomile tea with generous honey and lemon get down with white flowers and baking pie crust on this offering from Pierre Lafond, who's been making wine since the 1960s. The wine dances across the tongue, with bright papaya, pear and a dill-powered, nearly bitter finish. It's showing almost no age, so it will hold well, but it's also brilliant right now."
Grenache,US,California,Margerum,40.0,93.0,"Bright raspberry, cherry and rose petal aromas meet cola spice on the pretty, delicate nose of this bottling—a solid example of the surge in quality of Central Coast Grenache. There is a tense tannic structure to the palate despite its light nature, with great acidity presenting tangy red and purple fruit flavors, with more rose petal accents."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Ponzi,40.0,93.0,"This stellar reserve remains one of the finest Chardonnays from Oregon. Meyer lemon, peanut oil, salted nuts, citrus and tangerine combine in a deep and intense palate. Whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented (but in just 10% new French oak), this delicious, dense and penetrating wine should be consumed now through the early 2020s."
Syrah,US,California,Chamisal Vineyards,40.0,93.0,"The floral perfume of this cool-climate bottling is intense—all lavender accented with black pepper, white pepper and thyme. Tart black plum skin flavors lead the palate, building towards savory elements that recall dried purple flowers, thyme, rosemary and black pepper. Medium bodied and dense, it will be versatile with food."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Luis Cañas,40.0,93.0,"Smoky, toasty oak aromas are dominant on a black-fruit bouquet that also shows graphite. This is saturated and tight, with complexity and outright deliciousness of savory, meaty, spicy blackberry flavors. Toast, cured beef and cocoa flavors prove that there's more to this than just heft and oak. Best from 2019 through 2032."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Walt,40.0,93.0,"This is a blend of several marquee vineyards, including Gap's Crown, Martinelli and Widdoes. It comes together nicely in a mix of fig and baked bread, peppered in baking spices and dried herb. Cherry comes through along with subtle hints of violet and rose, before a long, lingering finish ties things in a juicy bow at the end."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,40.0,93.0,"This is a serious wine from Aveleda's estate in Bairrada. With its bold, tarry tannins and solid structure, it's a wine that combines longevity and impressive fruit. Mineral, structured and concentrated with big black-fruit flavors and a dry, solid core, it's destined for long aging. Drink from 2019."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Paul Jaboulet Aîné,40.0,93.0,"Jaboulet bought this 7.3-acre estate in 1998, and this is the first full vintage. It is a huge wine, with all the true inky blackness and density of a Cornas. Firm, dry and concentrated, it also has generous ripe black plums, a hint of sweet jelly. It makes an excellent mix of the traditional foursquare Cornas style, with modern sophistication."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Molino di Sant'Antimo,40.0,93.0,"This opens with inviting, classic Sangiovese aromas: woodland berry, forest floor, new leather, violet and truffle. The youthfully taut palate isn't quite as expressive—yet—but already offers Marasca cherry, white pepper and star anise notes. It's primary in its flavors now but will develop complexity over the next decade and then maintain well for years. Drink 2022–2032."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Boscarelli,40.0,93.0,"Fresh and linear, this opens with fragrant purple flower, red berry and new leather scents. The firm, youthfully austere palate is loaded with finesse, offering crunchy red cherry, fresh strawberry and licorice notes with taut, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Give it time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2019–2028."
Syrah,US,California,Covenant,40.0,93.0,"A bold and brawny wine from a relatively cool appellation, this red satisfies with its commingling of violet, meat and leathery black pepper aromas. Despite its brambly depth and concentration, it allows for a satisfying twist of freshness on the finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Kay Brothers,40.0,93.0,"This is full bodied yet firmly structured, built to enjoy now or age through at least 2025. Ample cedary oak notes frame blueberry fruit and peppery spice. This is tight but still enjoyable, ending in a lengthy crescendo of dusty tannins."
Red Blend,US,California,The Federalist,40.0,93.0,"The duel in this wine is between equal parts Zinfandel and Syrah, a winning combination in its thick, firm tannin weight wrapped around bright red fruit. Tangy acidity gives it a lift along a juicy and sophisticated palate, peppery and alive on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Waits-Mast,40.0,93.0,"A smoky tinge to the garnet color and savory, forest-floor aromas give a slightly earthy character to this deceptively full-bodied, fascinating wine. The flavors kick in vivid rhubarb, raspberry and pomegranate notes, while firm tannins, brisk acidity and a nice, dry mouthfeel add good structure."
Malbec,US,California,Martin Ranch,40.0,93.0,"If this delicious bottling is any indication, this region is prime for Malbec. Aromas of grape soda, black slate, turned loam, blueberry and purple flowers make for a nicely even nose, and the palate is rich and full with balanced tannins. The juicy flavors include black cherries, plums, cassis and blueberry extract, to which crushed, dried herbs give necessary nuance."
Riesling,New Zealand,Central Otago,Felton Road,40.0,93.0,"This wine shows a fine balance between sweetness (74 g/L) and acidity, reminiscent of a spätlese style. Striking scents of crushed stone, beeswax and lime burst from the glass, while the flavors combine peach and citrus notes. The finish shines, marrying sugar and acid into a long, tongue-tingling finale."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,40.0,93.0,This premium cuvée from Eugénie is packed both with superripe fruit and layers of wood aging flavors. The fruit of this impressive wine is still pushing through the dark tannins that give a dry dusty edge to the wine. It is powerful and rich and should age. Drink from 2020.
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Roubine,40.0,93.0,"The top cuvée from Roubine, this unusual blend of Tibouren and Clairette is intensely perfumed and ripe and with a fine stylish character. It is an impressive wine with yellow fruits as well as red currant and citrus. This food friendly wine should age a bit, so drink from late 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Renwood,40.0,93.0,"Bright, firmly structured and full of classic berry and savory flavors, this wine is rich but balanced and ready to serve with a steak, chop or rack for a special occasion. It has ripe fruit bolstered by firm acidity and a healthy coating of fine-grained, grippy tannins. Best after 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Duorum,40.0,93.0,"This is powerfully impressive, with its firm structure giving great depth to the rich black-cherry and plum fruits. Dense and tannic, it needs to age for at least four years."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Joseph Phelps,40.0,93.0,"This is a consistently delicious wine, fermented in a combination of new and once-used French oak. Fully realized, it has a sublime texture and light body that's balanced by long, lingering acidity. The fresh-fruit flavors show elements of orange, lime, lemon and peach."
Zinfandel,US,California,Renwood,40.0,93.0,"A handsome vein of toasted oak flavor runs through this opulently ripe wine from the aroma to the lingering finish. Along the way firm tannins and bright acidity buoy up the lavishly concentrated blackberry and boysenberry elements to present a dry, nicely textured and appetizingly tannic wine."
Syrah,US,Washington,K Vintners,40.0,93.0,"This aromatically brooding wine brings aromas of brown stems, scorched earth, smoked meat, iron, violets, orange peel and blue and black fruit. The flavors coat the palate from end to end with silky soft, unabashedly appealing fruit and savory notes. It hits the delicious gong hard, with an enduring finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Boete,40.0,93.0,"Grown in a south-facing site on limestone soil a mile east of Carmel Valley Village, this wine is dark and silky in the glass, with thick but not overripe blueberry and elderberry aromas, enhanced with sarsaparilla, smoked beef and crushed walnut notes. The palate is lush but vibrant with acidity, blending dark berry flavors with toasted oak, earth and cocoa spice."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Johannishof,40.0,93.0,"Initially subdued aromas of bramble, lime and herb are contrasted by loads of bright, juicy fruit on the palate of this radiant spätlese. Sweet-tart apricot and quince flavors seem gilded by crushed slate and honey. It's a tantalizing, deeply penetrating sip that catapults through a piercing lemon-lime finish."
Syrah,US,California,Drew,40.0,93.0,"Drew is single-handedly making a case for the tiny Mendocino Ridge appellation and its ability to nurture intense Syrah with this perfumed wine explosive in black pepper and cherry. Its fine, softly-hewed tannins keep things fresh and sinewy. Complex and dancing in acidity, this Syrah cries out for charcuterie, especially artisan salami, its perfect match in pepper."
Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Henry's Drive Vignerons,40.0,93.0,"This is a prime example of how blending Cabernet and Shiraz can benefit both. The Shiraz provides texture and amplitude, the Cabernet soaring cassis aromas and length on the finish. Smoky mocha-tinged oak frames that impressive velvety fruit, only slowly fading away. Drink 2018–2030."
Merlot,US,Washington,Northstar,40.0,93.0,"From a superb year, this wine saw all French oak, but an ongoing reduction in exposure to new barrels brought the percentage down to 60%. Young and muscular, the blend of black fruits, sweet oak and toasty spice is focused and compelling. Pure fruit flavors include black cherry and plum, smooth and concentrated, with a smoky kick in the lingering finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,Doyenne,40.0,93.0,"Lush, polished and detailed, this is as elegant as any Washington Syrah can be. Intensely fruity with lively raspberries and plums, it layers in details of earth, mushroom, pepper and herb, leading to a perfectly balanced, structured finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,40.0,93.0,"A blend of Chardonnay and Maria Gomes, here is a ripe wood- and apricot-flavored wine. It is full, spicy, livened by crispness from a red apple skin texture. The vanilla from the wood adds a delicious richness to this impressive wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Rulo,40.0,93.0,"This is 100% Cabernet, with the purity that is a recurring hallmark of Rulo's wines. A deep, and deeply satisfying fruit expression, lifted with juicy acidity, brings a mélange of berries, cassis and black cherries into play. The grace notes pile on—smoke, black olive, tar, tobacco leaf, bitter chocolate. Young, bracing, and built to age."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bargetto,40.0,93.0,"Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruits form the base of an aromatic profile that also picks up some sagebrush and dried cake frosting. Though lighter in body, the flavors emerge continually on the palate, from ripe berries to tomato stew to cola to mint. Serve with roasted chicken or turkey or even a rich pasta.  Bargetto has been making wine since 1933."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,40.0,93.0,"In the range of what Clos Troteligotte calls micro-parcels, this is in the middle. It's full of generous black fruits and attendant acidity. At the same time, it is young and still coming together. The future promises great concentration and depth of flavor. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,La Prevostura,40.0,93.0,"Made with 90% Nebbiolo and 10% Vespolina, this elegantly structured red offers a fragrance of crushed rose, wild berry, tilled soil, baking spice and iron. The sleek, focused palate boasts juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and white pepper backed up by a vein of energizing mineral. Bright acidity and polished tannins provide balance. Drink through 2017–2030."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Piazzo Armando,40.0,93.0,"Classic Nebbiolo aromas of wild berry, aromatic herb, tilled soil and a balsamic note slowly emerge on this structured red. The focused, full-bodied palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper, anise and mint alongside assertive tannins and bright acidity. It needs to come together but already boasts finesse and complexity. Drink 2019–2031."
Syrah,Chile,Marchigue,Polkura,40.0,93.0,"Ripe berry and cassis aromas are supported by sweet oak scents and related notes of graphite, vanilla and maple. This high-end Syrah is flush, full bodied and widespread. Flavors of oak, vanilla and mocha are up to the wine's rich blackberry and cassis fruit, while a plump wide finish with smooth tannins includes doses of mocha and coffee. Drink through 2023."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,La Chablisienne,40.0,93.0,"Situated next to the Grand Cru vineyards, this Premier Cru has produced a rich, concentrated and beautifully dense wine. Its rich, creamy texture is enhanced by bright acidity and underlying power. Touches wood aging show through in its spiciness. Drink from 2019."
Red Blend,Israel,Judean Hills,Shiloh Winery,40.0,93.0,"Dark violet-red in color, this is a blend of 40% Petite Sirah, 35% Petit Verdot and 25% Shiraz. A bouquet of cherry, violet and mesquite lay the groundwork for a winning mélange of savory fruit flavors—think cherry, strawberry, smoke, flint, jasmine and orange peel. Smooth tannins lead the way to an orange-rind finish, with a hint of smoke and a slight umami feeling on the palate."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tenuta delle Terre Nere,40.0,93.0,"Aromas of blue flower, wild berry, a hint of leather and brimstone lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry, grilled herb, oak, mineral and a hint of vanilla alongside firm, polished tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2017–2022."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Holman Ranch,40.0,93.0,"There's a touch of forest floor funk on this wine, but the nose also shows lots of stewed black cherries, chemise and mint-chocolate chip. The palate is deep and rich but not overly ripe, with raspberry and elderberry fruit cut by herbal seasonings of oregano, thyme, marjoram and mint."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Melipal,40.0,93.0,"The curtain rises to smooth, lightly balsamic aromas of blackberry, black cherry and cedar. On the tongue, this Malbec is plush, smooth, chewy and a touch creamy. Elevated berry, mocha and vanilla flavors are oaky but not overdone. The finish is pure, succinct and deep, with lasting black-fruit echoes. Drink through 2019."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,40.0,93.0,"Named after the lords of Hattstatt—a word that evolved to Hatschbourg—this wine comes from selected grapes. It's a medium sweet, rich wine with a smooth structure and opulent texture. Lychees and yellow fruits are cut with lime acidity to balance ripeness and freshness. It's a wine to age, drink from 2018."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tenuta delle Terre Nere,40.0,93.0,"Aromas of dark berry, mineral, blue flower and leather come together in the glass. The structured palate offers black cherry, coffee, oak, licorice and grilled Mediterranean herb alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. It ends on a mineral note. Drink 2017–2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Poças,40.0,93.0,"New wood aromas give this very fine wine a firm start in life. It also shows rich blackberry fruits, dark plums and a solid, tannic character. Dense and concentrated with a smooth surface hiding a much firmer core. A serious wine  needing aging."
Chardonnay,US,California,Jax,40.0,93.0,"Waxy and lightly lemony, this is a well-made, small-production wine from well-farmed vineyards, a steely, medium-bodied study in tangerine and green apple. Balanced and ready for the table, it has enough weight to match well against a wide range of foods and impress as an apéritif."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,La Chablisienne,40.0,93.0,"Facing almost due south, this Premier Cru vineyard produces some impressively rich wines. This bottling from the crisp 2014 vintage still shows ripe character, contrasting deliciously with intense acidity. The balance is just right, with a structure built to age. Drink from 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Domaine Eden,40.0,93.0,"Once again, this more affordable “younger brother” to the Mount Eden bottling competes with gusto. Including 14% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, it shows savory black plum, black pepper, char, leather and dried herb aromas on the nose. The palate is hearty and almost salty tasting, with beef, charred black fruit, pine resin and caramel flavors. Very satisfying and full of umami characteristics."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Vincent Carême,40.0,93.0,"From one of the top of the new generation of Vouvray estates, this wine is a delicious medley of fruit flavors. With a touch of honey to go with the apple, and citrus to give extra freshness, this is a beautiful wine. It is very drinkable although still so young. Drink now if you can't wait, but it's better to hold on until 2021."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Losada,40.0,93.0,"Losada wines are dark, dense, heady creatures. This high-end version delivers deep mineral and lead aromas alongside cassis, berry and toasted notes. The palate is upright like a good cadet, with lively acidity, blackberry and spice flavors. This is big and modern but not extreme. Drink through 2023."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Domaine de Cause,40.0,93.0,"Produced from the old vines of one of Cahor's emblematic estates, this is a dark, dense and concentrated wine. Full of black plum skins that are balanced with acidity, it is rich with black cherry and a smoky character from the wood aging. This 100% Malbec does need aging and should be drunk from 2019."
Syrah,US,California,Dragonette,40.0,93.0,"This blend comes from seven vineyards: John Sebastiano, Shadow Canyon, Thompson, Harrison Clarke, Watch Hill and Stolpman. Melded with 10% Grenache and 1% Viognier, it shows warm gingerbread and blackberry aromas, cut by pencil lead and anise. The flavors expertly balance ripeness with tannins and acidity, offering dynamic ollallieberry, pepper-crusted roast pork, wild herbs and a touch of vanilla on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Chamisal Vineyards,40.0,93.0,"Wildly expressive aromas include maple syrup-laced chamomile tea, root beer extract, wild raspberry and menthol. The palate continues the excellent array: red fruits with oregano, thyme, even basil, some sanguine flavors, some coffee. It would be a perfect companion to roasted pork or turkey, or anything that needs some extra spice."
Syrah,US,California,Chasseur,40.0,93.0,"Tannic on the entry, this wine evolves softly into balanced overtones of leather and cherry, representing the more restrained and elegant side of Syrah that's possible in cooler pockets of the Russian River Valley when the grapes are put in good hands. A peppery bite to the finish adds intrigue."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,40.0,93.0,"Here the blend is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, the rest an even split between Cab Franc and Merlot. Straightforward and unadorned, this wine is tightly defined, with sleek and juicy red fruit flavors. Cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and even a bit of pomegranate mingle together, with substantial acids. The 50% new oak is barely evident, but some pleasing toastiness seeps into the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,40.0,93.0,"From the oldest vines owned by the producer, this wine is intense and concentrated. Packed with citrus and still-bright herbal flavors it has layers of minerality and perfumed acidity. It still has its freshness which is in the process of changing into a rich maturity. Drink now and until 2024."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fess Parker,40.0,93.0,"This bottling from the historic vineyard boasts a balanced, smoky quality on the nose that pairs well with its sharper white flower and salted nut aromas. Its acidity and tongue-tingling texture on the palate is addictive, revealing ripe Gala apple flavors backed by lemon juice, sea salt, oak and wet stone notes."
Syrah,US,Washington,Doyenne,40.0,93.0,"Cofermented with 2% Viognier, this elegant Syrah rests on a base of toast, coffee grounds, loam and savory herbs. The fruit—pie cherries and plums—is subservient to the details of earth, mushroom and leather. All is beautifully integrated, balanced and long. A wine to savor."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,DiamAndes,40.0,93.0,"Blackberry, blueberry and maple aromas announce a rich, ripe wine. There's also toast and char on the nose. In the mouth, this is layered and grabby, with mossy black-fruit flavors that end in a cool, earthy swirl of cola and licorice. This blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Syrah is a stunner and should be consumed now through 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,José Maria da Fonseca,40.0,93.0,"This is a dense wine, with mint aromas and dark, brooding tannins. Black plum and berry fruits are both rich and tight, with a strong mineral texture. It brings out the hard soil of the Douro and also the heat in the valley. It does need to age, so drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Walt,40.0,93.0,"A full-bodied, well-polished and nicely oaky wine with a smooth and full texture. Flavors are ripe and fruity and laced with vanilla, maple and toasted bread nuances. Vibrant acidity pairs with firm tannins to keep it mouthwatering on the finish."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,40.0,93.0,"Peachy overtones hover around the rose-petal scent of this fruity offering. This aromatic combo re-appears on the palate where it is rounded off with a little residual sweetness that suits the plush palate rather well. Here and there are wondrous glimpses of clear honey, dried peach and honeysuckle. Citrus freshness provides a lovely counterpoint and carries the long finish."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Gloria Ferrer,40.0,93.0,"The later disgorging of this wine made from 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay has given it a complexity of texture and flavor that's compelling, an older golden-apple and dried apricot sensibility that's intriguing on the nose and palate. Sizzling acidity makes for a crisp, dry wine, with lengthy finish."
Syrah,US,California,La Voix,40.0,93.0,"Steve Clifton's music-inspired project heads to the Syrah-focused appellation of Ballard Canyon to produce this well-hewn bottling that kicks off with boysenberry, hibiscus, rose bud and white pepper aromas. Tart elderberry jam flavors meld with wild thyme and savory pepper spice on the complex palate, which culminates in a mouthwatering finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,José Maria da Fonseca,40.0,93.0,"A rich and smooth wine, its tannins already deliciously integrated into the juicy black fruits. The wine has a tarry character along with its blackberry acidity, sweetness and an extra roundness from the wood. Worth aging for 3–4 years."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Wiegner,40.0,93.0,"This fragrant wine starts with aromas of rose, violet, cake spice and woodland berry. The vibrant palate doles out juicy black cherry, licorice, cinnamon, pipe tobacco and mineral. It's impeccably balanced with velvety tannins and bright acidity."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Geyerhof,40.0,93.0,"One of a series of great single-vineyard wines from Geyerhof, this is as impressive as the rest. It has weight, complexity and richness. Its perfumed fruits provide a delicate counterpoint to the acidity, taut minerality and herbal edge. For aging over at least five years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Walt,40.0,93.0,"What stands out most in this wine is its floral flirtation, the ability to draw in the nose effortlessly and seductively. From there, it offers cherry-berry, cola and peppery clove in equal measure, the acidity in check and spicy on the tongue."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Maritávora,40.0,93.0,"This powerful, tarry and ripe wine offers weight as well as good black fruits. As it develops, it will reveal ripe berry flavors with a balanced structure. Drink this potentially impressive wine from 2021."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,John Duval Wines,40.0,93.0,"Dark berry and plum fruit dominates, but hints of mint, vanilla and cedar add interest. Somewhere between silky and velvety, this full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz finishes long and appears to have the tannic structure to age well, though it's delicious now."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Gunter Triebaumer,40.0,93.0,"Soft aromatic notions of red cherry and blueberry, along with white pepper, rise from the glass. The palate brims with tart crunchy ripe fruit and emphasizes blueberry. There is a light touch here and lovely fluidity—the tannins are like starched velvet. This is refreshing and very elegant. It's neither light nor heavy, but just right and medium bodied, perfect for subtle cuisine."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Stadt Krems,40.0,93.0,"Soft and aromatic hints of orange fruit and zest play on the nose. Riper hints of juicy mirabelle also join. The palate has the same, fragrant, generous and appetizing aspect of fruit, but has an extra dimension of savoriness from yeast and a wonderfully linear body, shaped by freshness and zest. The finish is long, tangy and aromatic."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Peake Ranch,40.0,93.0,"This is the first round of wines from this project by John Wagner, who owns parts of Sierra Madre and John Sebastiano vineyards, and winemaker Paul Lato. Black-plum skins, roasted game, anise and sandalwood aromas show on the nose. Earthy and zesty, the palate delivers cranberry-beet juice along with roasted fennel, eucalyptus oil and bitter Earl Grey tea touches."
Chardonnay,US,California,Peake Ranch,40.0,93.0,"This is the first white bottling from a new project by John Wagner, co-owner of John Sebastiano and Sierra Madre vineyards, and winemaker Paul Lato. Flint, dried limes, chives and a touch of smoked chicken show on the fresh nose. Light and clean on the sip, it's distinctive with flavors of buttered lemon slices, smoke and sweet onions."
St. Laurent,Austria,Niederösterreich,R&A; Pfaffl,40.0,93.0,"Fine red-cherry notes are perfumed by the more decadent aroma of candied Amarena cherries. The palate reveals hints of conifer and white pepper, framing the mellow but surprisingly textured and dense body. This is sumptuous in oak and concentrated for a St. Laurent—but the fruit is at perfect pitch. This needs further bottle age; drink 2019–2028."
St. Laurent,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,40.0,93.0,"Sumptuous notes of fresh, aromatic red cherries are central to this wine. They are joined by a sonorous, soft and mellow oak spice and texture and sprays of fresh white pepper. There are hints of iron oxide and an intensely brooding flavor of pure, black cherry at the very core. This draws you in and just makes you want to savor. Lovely now, this will come out of its shell with some bottle age. Drink 2016–2020."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Kiona,40.0,93.0,"Cyclops II is an equal blend of Syrah and Mourvèdre from 2011, and Grenache from 2009. Complex and fragrant, it's a perfect match of strengths. Strawberry, cherry and blue plum fruits are underscored with layers of earth, graphite and licorice. It's already nicely balanced, and its nonvintage makeup may have helped push along the aging process. Drink now and over the next five years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Northstar,40.0,93.0,"Consumers may find it difficult to differentiate this from the 2010 Ste. Michelle version of the same wine—both are 100% Cold Creek vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. But this one, bottled under the Northstar label, has more muscle, more power and more depth. Tannic, thick and darkly fruited, it's a tightly-wound yet expressive effort, with complex flavors that move from black cherry and cassis into fig, tar, tobacco, espresso, dark chocolate and smoke."
St. Laurent,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,40.0,93.0,"A very intriguing nose of fresh dill and dried anise gives this plenty of aromatic lift, following through on the concentrated palate where ripe cherries join. Oak tannins lend additional structure but never dominate. While lovely now, this will certainly gain from a year or two in the cellar. Its soft, but full body is a triumph. Drink from 2016–2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Waits-Mast,40.0,93.0,"A distinctive personality shines through in the almost floral and lightly spicy aromas, the vivid and generous cherry-tart flavors and the ever-so-supple texture of this full-bodied wine. While it has firm acidity and tannins, this is a posh, luxurious beverage in which to indulge."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Chandon,40.0,93.0,"This is a finely made mix of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes, light golden in color and dripping in marzipan, hazelnuts and baked bread. Complex and layered, it's got a depth of soul around zesty acidity, staying fleshy and full on the tongue."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,40.0,93.0,"Produced from the oldest vines on the Bourgeois family estate, this is a flint and steel-textured wine. The fruit is still coming through the intense texture of this complex wine. The hints of apple and grapefruit will develop as the wine ages. Unlike so many Sancerre, this needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin,40.0,93.0,"A structured, tannic wine, this has dark fruits and a solid, dense character that's freshened by the acidity. The wood aging is still showing with toasty, spicy flavors. These need to be further integrated into the wine as it ages, so wait to drink until 2018."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,40.0,93.0,"Old vines from the Bisamberg Vineyard have produced a rich, beautifully ripe wine. Its white and yellow fruit flavors give richness, concentration and a great spicy character. With its density, structure and intense acidity, it's likely to age well over 3–5 years. Glass stopper."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Bernard Fleuriet et Fils,40.0,93.0,"Produced from the oldest vines of the Domaine, the wine is taut while also ripe. It has a crisp edge along with hints of the year's wood aging. That adds spice and a peppery edge to the ripe yellow and golden-plum flavors. Drink from early 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quevedo,40.0,93.0,"Aged for 14 months in large new-wood barrels, this wine from the Quevedo siblings is lush and generous, with swathes of ripe, rich fruit. Firm tannins promise further aging, while the juicy fruitiness shines strongly. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Waits-Mast,40.0,93.0,"Warm spicy wintertime scents like cinnamon, clove and nutmeg meet baked fruit flavors and a broad soothing texture in this full-bodied wine. The color has an amber tint at the rim, the texture is absolutely mouth-filling but gentle, and the finish lingers nicely. The husband-wife winemaking duo let native yeast ferment the wine, and then aged it in 33% new French barrels from Remond."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Lange,40.0,93.0,"This wine is all Dijon clone, aged in two- to four-year-old puncheons. Bright and aromatic, it opens with a toasty scent and a mix of lemony citrus, pineapple and banana fruit. It's smooth and delicious and nicely layered, with an enduring finish."
Syrah,US,California,Terre Rouge,40.0,93.0,"This bold, spicy, well-structured makes a big impact on the palate. Cedar, clove and black pepper aromas lead to rich, ripe blackberry and dried plum flavors, while firm tannins and good acidity lend both grip and texture. Known to age well, this wine will be best after 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Italy,Tuscany,Rocca di Castagnoli,40.0,93.0,"Aromas of licorice, cedar, red currants and graphite unfold in the glass. The structured palate offers black cherries, blackberries, coffee, tobacco and black pepper alongside firm, velvety tannins that wrap around the palate. Drink 2016–2022."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Altesino,40.0,93.0,"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this supple, delicious wine opens with aromas of blackberry, tilled soil, leather, vanilla and tobacco. The juicy palate doles out black cherry, fleshy plum, well-integrated oak and graphite. It's balanced with firm but fine-grained tannins and modest acidity. Drink through 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Orfila,40.0,93.0,"Luxurious aromas of gingerbread, blackberry jam, black cherry juice and smoked pork meet with a touch of iodine, loam and lava rock in this wine from a producer just north of San  Diego. Red cherries and pomegranate juice tighten up around dried fennel stalks and pencil shavings on the sanguine palate. It's tasty now, but will blossom from 2019–2025."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weixelbaum,40.0,93.0,"Creamy, nutty hints of oak frame fresh pear on nose and palate. The creamy texture cushions the freshness of the wine which has a pleasant weight. Together this makes for an unusual but convincing wine. Lovely now but this has the mileage to last three to five years."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,40.0,93.0,"The heavy bottle leaves little doubt that this is the top wine from Château Eugénie. Inside is an impressive, beautifully balanced wine. It has new-wood mint flavors, with still young fruit. In 4–5 years, this will be at its peak"
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,40.0,93.0,"Black as ink, this is a rich and beautifully smooth, concentrated wine. It has weight and depth of flavor, with cinnamon and finely integrated opulent fruit and tannins. This is a wine for aging over several years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine l'Ancienne Cure,40.0,93.0,"From this top Bergerac producer comes this powerful blend. With its 30% Malbec, it has intense tannins and a firm, solid structure, with dense and richly concentrated blackberry fruit. It does need to age for at least five years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Schmelz,40.0,93.0,"Sprightly grapefruit zest notions play with peppery arugula to make a spicy streamline along the palate. White pepper is vibrant along the edges and delivers lots of excitement on the tight, concentrated and slender palate. Beautiful now but with the stuffing to age."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Avennia,40.0,93.0,"This stunning blend of Mourvèdre (49%), Grenache (28%) and Syrah brings a complex, nuanced assortment of mineral, raspberry, white pepper, thistle and carob notes. It's richly flavored, layered, dense and supple showing both great subtlety and intensity, with fruit flavors that linger after the last sip."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta de Chocapalha,40.0,93.0,"The owners' Swiss connections are commemorated in the international initials for Switzerland (CH) on the label, but everything else about this wine is resolutely Portuguese. From its dense tannins and dry core to its bold red fruit, it's full bodied, rich, ripe and likely to age further. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,40.0,93.0,"Aromatic but tart notes of kumquat signal concentration and citric poise. The palate is rich with zesty, aromatic notes of tangerine zest. This is concentrated and dry, explosive and aromatic—a bundle of citrus energy, with swirling clouds of kumquat and tangerine."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Martin Schaetzel,40.0,93.0,"Lifted notes of beeswax and chamomile signal maturity. In contrast to these wonderfully evolved notes, the palate sings with freshness and verve. This is resolutely dry but full of charm, despite its serious if gentle nature. The body is characterized by fluidity, concentration, warmth and freshness. A great joy that lasts long after the last sip."
Müller-Thurgau,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tiefenbrunner,40.0,93.0,"Showing extreme elegance, this fragrant, radiant wine opens with aromas of jasmine, white peach and aromatic herb.

Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,La Chablisienne,40.0,93.0,"In the Middle Ages, this vineyard was on the boundary between Burgundy and Champagne. This is a plush , rich wine with a broad, full character. It offers ripeness, yellow fruits and crisp, fresh acidity at the end. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,La Fenêtre,40.0,93.0,"There's a unique nose on this single-vineyard bottling by Joshua Klapper, with black olives, dried figs, cranberries and wood ash combining into a delicate almond-brittle sensation. The palate is subtle and restrained, all about finessed energy and nuanced texture, opening up into strawberries and cracked black pepper. Great right now but will live through 2025-plus."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Laporte,40.0,93.0,Organically grown grapes are the source of this wine that comes from selected parcels on the Domaine de Rochoy. Flint soil gives a strongly mineral character that permeates the wine. The tight and steely texture contrasts happily with the sliced apple and lemon flavors. It needs to age for several more months. Drink from late 2017.
Zinfandel,US,California,Sequum,40.0,93.0,"A brambly and intense vineyard-designate rich in blackberry and brown sugar, this proffers just intense enough to provoke, but never gets extreme. Soft on the palate, it has a lively undercurrent of dark cherry grenadine and black pepper. This is one to remember, with a cool label to boot."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),40.0,93.0,"Heady notes of saffron and pollen lend a savory spicy tone to honey-kissed chamomile and white grapefruit flavors in this dazzling auslese. Shocks of lemon-lime awaken the midpalate, leading to a long crystalline finish."

Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,40.0,93.0,"Produced only in top years, this Tannat-dominated wine is named after the Greenwich 0-degree longitude that passes through the vineyard.

The wood aging combines easily with the fruit tannins to give a textured, dry background. Drink from late 2015."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Timbre,40.0,93.0,"A basket of tart red cherries, chipped asphalt, fresh-picked thyme and even a touch of rosemary show on the nose of this bottling by Josh Klapper from Riverbench Vineyard. Warmer flavors of cranberry, bay leaf and more thyme make the mouth water, boosted by a plum-skin-flavored acidity."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Chateau Les Amoureuses,40.0,93.0,"Mainly Grenache, this is a full, rich, velvety Rhône blend. Toasty oak, vanilla and baking spices dominate the youthful aromas, backed by black cherry fruit on the palate. It's warm and plush on the finish. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,US,Washington,Fielding Hills,40.0,93.0,"The Fielding Hills Syrah remains one of my favorites in a state loaded with great Syrahs, fruit-powered with spicy purple fruits, annotated with scents of game, anise, smoke and moist earth. The black and purple fruits dominate, as expressive and ripe as any Syrah in the state. It's still young, a bit oaky, and relatively high in alcohol. Give it some bottle age and all the complexity will come into focus."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Kaleidos,40.0,93.0,"Dark and dense in the glass, this blend of 65% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 10% Mourvèdre by winemaker Steve Martell shows deep but fresh blueberry fruit with an herbal edge of oregano and marjoram, plus touches of crushed asphalt, milk chocolate and smoke. Thyme and fennel fronds show on the dry and structure sip, with blackcurrant, tobacco, elderberry and leather flavors as well."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Jean-Marc Brocard,40.0,93.0,"The wine is rich and full in the mouth with ripe fruit from the deep clay soil of this premier cru. It is beautifully concentrated and ripe. The fruit is so crisp and juicy that this yellow and white-fruit flavored wine could be drunk now. That would be a shame, because it will be even better from 2018."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Godelia,40.0,93.0,"Ripe black-fruit aromas are cuddly and reflect the warm conditions of 2012. Tight and ribbed on the palate, this has the structure to handle blackberry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors without seeming overripe or jammy. A saturated finish benefits from the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2023."
Muscat,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,40.0,93.0,"A lovely mix of gentle rose petal, sandalwood and honeysuckle perfumes the nose. The palate has an earthy element, grounding these flavors and a texture of silky peach skin, along with soft peachy fruit. The body is light and lifted—an almost weightless pleasure—but with concentration and lasting flavors. This is a compact bundle of aromatic joy."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Cafaggio,40.0,93.0,"Made with Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of toasted oak, cedar, mocha and plum. The fresh palate delivers juicy blackberry, black cherry, vanilla, dark chocolate and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. A licorice note tops off the lingering finish."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Verrazzano,40.0,93.0,"This full-bodied blend of Sangiovese and 5% Canaiolo opens with heady scents of iris, violet, dark berry and a note of pipe tobacco.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Alleromb,40.0,93.0,"Holding 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, this wine leads with inviting aromas of blackberries, dark cherries and tar, showing a fresh, fruit-forward profile. The dense fruit flavors deliver on all of this promise with layers of complexity, spot-on balance and good length."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Casa al Vento,40.0,93.0,"Red berry, pressed violet, tilled soil and a whiff of tobacco lead the nose.

Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Casa al Vento,40.0,93.0,"Elegantly structured, this opens with enticing scents of red berry, blue flower and a whiff of tilled soil. The vibrant palate is loaded with finesse, offering crunchy red cherry, strawberry, star anise and a hint of mineral alongside silky tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2023."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Long Meadow Ranch,40.0,93.0,"This new wine from an estate vineyard is the strong, quiet type that's not effusively fruity but instead emphasizes mineral elements and great structure. An attractive chalky, spicy aroma leads to beautifully restrained red cherry and pomegranate flavors that seem to grow and expand with each sip. The texture is firmly tannic but also polished, supported by perfect acidity that keeps everything sharp and focused."
Malbec,US,Washington,Kerloo,40.0,93.0,"All varietal coming from two blocks of this vineyard, this wine dazzles with its strikingly pure aromas of plum, herbs and spice. The flavors don't disappoint, coating the palate with velvety, restrained, exquisitely balanced fruit flavors that perfectly capture the essence of this variety. For those looking for a primer on Malbec in Washington, look no further."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Viña Cobos,40.0,93.0,"The color of this Malbec and the legs it gives off help separate it from the pack. A plush nose shows unabsorbed oak and char along with deep berry and cassis notes. Total saturation on the palate matches the nose, and this tastes of chocolate, mocha, wood spice and rich berry fruits. Oak is currently speaking the loudest on the finish. Drink through 2023."
Syrah,US,California,Hard Six Cellars,40.0,93.0,"From a new, small producer, this vibrantly peppery wine captures the power and grace the variety is capable of when grown on the far reaches of the coast. That peppery quality follows through on the palate, buoyed by juicy acidity and smoothly layered blackberry, tobacco and tea flavors. Exquisitely made and worth seeking out."
St. Laurent,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,40.0,93.0,"Something floral and soft hovers above the fruit. There also is the rich hazel presence of fine oak. The fruit is beautifully luminous: very aromatic red cherry is drenched in the soft vanilla of oak. The tannins are silky but dense. White pepper shimmers everywhere, supported by the inherent freshness of the palate. This still needs time. Drink 2020–2030."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Rede,40.0,93.0,"Dominated by Touriga Nacional, this is a powerfully structured, rich wine. The wood aging shows through the mint flavors that brings complexity to the wine. Toast and spice also feature strongly while masking the ripe black plum fruits. Drink this impressive wine from 2018."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Langtry,40.0,93.0,"This wine has dark fruit and spicy oak flavors, plenty of concentration and a full body. It maintains a sleek, balanced feel despite the potent tannins of this grape variety. The finish is flavorful and long-lasting. Drink a bottle or two now and cellar several more until at least 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,La Crema,40.0,93.0,"This wine is made in decent quantities, enough to hopefully find, and that's good news, given its quality for the price. Juicy, spicy and just the right amount of herbal, it has sizzling acidity that livens and refreshens the palate, dotted in chocolate-covered cherry, plum and clove."
Syrah,US,California,Donkey & Goat,40.0,93.0,"There are subtle wild cherry and blackberry high notes in this stellar Syrah, much of it whole-cluster pressed from a cool site in a cool year. That combination of site and year dance into a peppery, leathery, savory, slightly smoky Syrah, medium in body, that's more about complexity and finesse than power."
Zinfandel,US,California,Bella,40.0,93.0,"Quite full bodied and obviously powerful in flavor, this wine is piled deep and rich with fruit aromas and flavors like ripe blackberries and blueberries plus chocolate and espresso. An impressive, astringent texture adds structure and makes it appetizing to drink, while the tannins seem to help the opulent flavors linger during the aftertaste."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Boeckel,40.0,93.0,"Lovely enticing freshness of freshly cut Conference pear jumps from the glass. On the palate, the pear fruit becomes fleshed out with more juiciness and ripeness and shines with its pristine purity. There is a lovely phenolic edge that gives guiding structure alongside lemon freshness. This is concentrated but not heavy, rounded but utterly refreshing. This strikes a great balance between freshness and generosity and has a dry lip-smacking finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,Portugal,Tejo,Rui Reguinga,40.0,93.0,"Both stylish and complex, this wine has great tannins and impressive fruits. An impeccable balance along with flavors from 12 months of wood aging is what gives this wine its cohesion and aging potential. This is a fine wine from the top vines of this producer. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sanctuary,40.0,93.0,"Toasted sandalwood, hints of sagebrush, crushed pencils, tart cranberry and vanilla brioche show on the nose of this bottling. The tannic structure is light but shows structure and tension, with rich flavors of cherry, cola, vanilla and clove."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Mouchão,40.0,93.0,"This is the second wine of Mouchão estate, a power in its own right. It is beautifully perfumed with violets and spice while its tannins and dark chocolate flavors are well integrated with the generous black fruits and acidity. The wine, even at four-years-old, is still young and will need much further aging. Drink from 2020."
Syrah,US,California,Larner,40.0,93.0,"Fresh blueberry and blackberry juice aromas meet with pepper and pressed lavender on the nose of this sleek bottling by Michael Larner, one of the Ballard Canyon appellation's loudest proponents. Black plum and dried black raspberry flavors show on the palate, which is layered with cracked pepper, cigar box and a minty lift on the lengthy sip."
Spätburgunder,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,40.0,93.0,"Gorgeous sprays of blossom cascade upon layers of ripe blackberry and plum in this ripe yet elegantly structured red. The palate is intensely concentrated in black-fruit flavor, brightened by cranberry acidity and extending through a long vanilla-kissed finish. A neatly balanced, irresistible wine to enjoy now through 2025."
Red Blend,US,California,Wilde Farm Wines,40.0,93.0,"This is a field blend from a great vineyard site in the heart of Sonoma Valley, aged in neutral oak and 40% whole cluster, unfined and unfiltered. Zinfandel, Mourvèdre, Mondeuse, Alicante Bouschet and other grapes make up the mix, providing an extracted, whole-cluster richness of flavor and body without reaching too far. Crisp black cherry, subtle white pepper and smoky tannin star."
Syrah,US,California,Terre Rouge,40.0,93.0,"Massive in structure and very generous in flavor, this wine has light vanilla and nutmeg aromas, but dark and potent blackberry and espresso flavors smothered in a thick layer of fine tannins. There is no denying the wine's richness but it holds everything in a dry, firm texture to achieve great balance. Best to drink from 2018 to 2028."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Le Casematte,40.0,93.0,"A blend of 55% Nerello Mascalese, 25% Nerello Cappuccio, 10% Nocera and 10% Nero d'Avola, this intriguing wine boasts earthy aromas of tilled soil, pressed blue flower, black-skinned fruit, black olive, nut and a touch of game. The velvety palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, cake spice and mineral while a saline note energizes the finish. Bright acidity and firm, refined tannins provide seamless support."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kessler-Haak,40.0,93.0,"This wine by winemaker and owner Dan Kessler offers a zesty nose of crushed boysenberry, black raspberry, scarlet rose petal, wild sage and a touch of violet. There is lots of fresh zip to the sip, where woody elderberries and black plum are lifted by mint and more lively violet character. The finish is laced with juniper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,William Knuttel,40.0,93.0,"A 100% varietal wine from the hillsides of the appellation, this dances in crisp, upfront acidity and soft texture, showcasing a wealth of juicy blackberry, cranberry and mocha dust flavor. It's robust yet balanced, with a seam of firm tannins tht lends both structure and grace."
White Blend,Italy,Tuscany,I Sodi,40.0,93.0,"Made with dried grapes—67% Malvasia and 33% Trebbiano—this meditation wine opens with intense aromas of maple syrup, carob and crushed raw almond. The concentrated palate doles out dried apricot, chestnut honey and toasted hazelnut while fresh acidity balances the sweet flavors."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Hugel,40.0,93.0,"Slight smoke mixes in the nose of this wine, with lifted mandarin-peel notes. The dry palate is streamlined and has uncommon lightness. It's weightless but concentrated, with full and bright citrus lift and a lively core brimming with lemon, bergamot and lime. The finish is wonderfully clean. This will drink well through 2024, at least."
Zinfandel,US,California,Renwood,40.0,93.0,"With fresh, pure fruit flavors, great balance and very full body, this wine will be great at the table. It has a dry but velvety feel, moderate tannins and good acidity, all of which lift up the great cherry and boysenberry nuances and give an overall impression of freshness."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Minuty,40.0,93.0,"The top wine from this estate, this is also the most dense and tight. An ageworthy medley of red fruits and peach is sharpened by acidity and a peppery edge. It does have a lighter touch with its poised crisp texture and its juicy aftertaste. However, it will be even better from the end of 2016."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin,40.0,93.0,"With wood-based aromas, this is currently a closed, taut wine. It has green fruits and minerality; it's nervy and under tension. The acidity is crisp while very light in character. This is for aging."
Syrah,US,Washington,Crossfork Creek,40.0,93.0,"Crossfork Creek is a new label for Sheridan Vineyard, designed, says winemaker Scott Greer, as his laboratory for vinous experimentation. This meaty, smoky, dense and chewy Syrah is one of the first releases. The black cherry and cassis flavors are accented with a touch of cola, and the wine resolves with a firm, substantial and somewhat tannic finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Montrose,40.0,93.0,"The wine is powerful with fine tannins and concentrated black fruits. The dense texture is lifted by the acidity and beautiful fruit of the vintage. The tannins are dusty, tight and surrounded by beautiful fruit and acidity. This, the second wine of Montrose, will develop surely over the next several years. Drink from 2024."
Pinot Noir,US,California,De Loach,40.0,93.0,"Garden herb and forest floor aromas make a case for this wine to be considered the producer's “Finest Selection” (the “FS” in “OFS”). On the palate, wild strawberry, black cherry and berry are the story, while powerful spice adds intrigue to the velvety texture, roundness and full-bodied concentration."
Chardonnay,US,California,Alma Fria,40.0,93.0,"Clarified butter is the first flavor to hit the palate of this wine, with a fresh, herbal essence that gives it a farmhouse feel. Cucumber and lemony acidity follow, as well as a pronounced oyster shell-like mineral note. This is a light, bright white ready for the table or as an apéritif."
Tannat-Syrah,US,California,Pulchella,40.0,93.0,"A fascinating, promising blend of 66% Tannat and 34% Syrah, this bottling begins with lavish aromas of blueberry, cola, milk chocolate and sweet tobacco on the rich, deep nose. It's hard not to like once sipped, with lots of big, juicy black fruit but also an elegant tannic structure. Flavors of vanilla, cocoa and roasted meat ensue."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,40.0,93.0,"Nuanced aromatics of smoky red cherry and the slightest tinge of elderberry promise joy. The palate is supported well by unobtrusive, well-handled oak and comes together as an elegant, velvety whole. Edges of spice fizz around the central backbone of acidity. This is lovely and slender, beautiful now but with the structure and stuffing to age. The lingering aftertaste speaks of ripe fruit."
Syrah,US,California,Barton,40.0,93.0,"This bottling is a reference to the Guns 'n' Roses hit song, and proves to be quite a destination itself, with aromas of cocoa, coffee, smoked meats, ginger snaps and cinnamon strudel against a canvas of deep blueberry. Tannins provide tension on the palate, with rich flavors of mocha and blackberry, coming in just a tad hot."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Schmelz,40.0,93.0,"Hints of woodruff, green pear and grapefruit zest frame the ripe yet firm palate. A pleasant phenolic edge adds even more structure, while the finish is bracingly clean. A tight and concentrated wine which will last and develop."
Claret,US,Washington,Matthews,40.0,93.0,"This wine is 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot, 5% Syrah, 3% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot. It displays fruit-forward aromas of blackberry seed, plum, asphalt and spice. The flavors are dense, focused and layered, showing depth, purity and texture."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Trerose,40.0,93.0,"Lovely aromas of plum, crushed violet, iris and cake spice mingle in the glass. The delicious, smooth palate doles out layers of ripe black cherry, blackberry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside velvety tannins. It's already tempting but will age well for a decade or more. Drink 2017–2027."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,40.0,93.0,"Perfumed with floral, citric freshness this evokes jasmine blossom and cut grapefruit peel. The palate is of an exquisite lightness and a slight spritz adds extra zip to the already electric little number. Just one sip of this ultrapure, racy wine and you are thoroughly refreshed. This is a Riesling that spells summer."
Syrah,Israel,Galilee,Recanati,40.0,93.0,"This deep-violet colored wine has a bouquet of cherry and butterscotch. Powerful tannins lay the groundwork for bold fruit flavors of blackberry and cranberry laced with notes of butterscotch, pipe tobacco and cocoa. It is full in the mouth, with a lingering finish marked by a pleasing vein of bright acidity."
Malbec,US,Washington,Kontos,40.0,93.0,"Sadly, only one barrel was made of this exceptional wine, from what may be the best site for Malbec in the entire state. It's a mouth-teasing mix of plum, cherry, cola, chocolate and clean loam, with silky tannins and a hint of Bourbon on the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Renwood,40.0,93.0,"This sleek wine carries ripe, complex fruit aromas and delicious cherry and blackberry flavors on a silky-smooth texture, despite high alcohol. There is definitely an exotic touch to the fruit character, and it seems perfectly supported by fine-grained tannins, lip-smacking acidity and good length on the finish. Drink now through 2020."
Zinfandel,US,California,Renwood,40.0,93.0,"A striking and flavorful wine, this bottling shows a little more spicy oak than most of the Renwoods, giving a slightly sweet cinnamon accent to the vivid blackberry and strawberry syrup flavors. The fruit character is powerful and delicious, seemingly seeping out of the wine in all directions. It's dry, full bodied, firm textured and will drink nicely now through 2020."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Weszeli,40.0,93.0,"Notions of ripe, red apple are deliciously pervaded by spiky lemon freshness, creating a tension between tart crispness and inviting ripeness—much like a perfectly balanced apple itself—just supercharged and concentrated. This seems to have a drive all of its own and a luminous, appetizing, irresistible fruitiness."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Margerum,40.0,93.0,"Black cherry, cola, dried sagebrush and caked lilac and lavender flowers show on this blend of 41% Grenache, 37% Syrah, 14% Mourvèdre, 4% Counoise and 4% Cinsaut. The palate focuses on purple flavors of lavender, lilac, black plum and black pepper, with a strong acidity that lingers long on the tongue."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lombardi,40.0,93.0,"This producer impresses again with this vibrantly layered, fleshy coastal-grown white, which is golden in color and brooding in baked lemon and a length of spiced apple. Its nicely contoured acidity supports a tang of crisp citrus."
Chardonnay,US,California,Calera,40.0,93.0,"There's a stunning amount of action on the nose of this bottling by Josh Jensen, with dried jasmine, lemon curd, squeezed tangerine, key lime pie and a warm touch of nuttiness. Rounded stonefruit and apple blossoms show on the palate, which is bound by a grapefruit pith grip and features a steadily growing salty character that comes on smooth and strong. A botanical twist hits the finish."
Petit Verdot,US,Washington,Côtes de Ciel,39.0,93.0,"Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron. Note the alcohol is pushing 16% however it is beautifully integrated."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine Coustarret,39.0,93.0,"With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of Jurançon, in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity. It is delicious, but it would be a shame for the taste Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret created not to age it, so drink from 2019."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Badia a Coltibuono,39.0,93.0,"Forest floor, new leather, ripe, dark-skinned berry and hint of blue flower are some of the scents you'll discover on this structured, polished red. The smooth, delicious palate offers layers of fleshy black cherry, baking spice and dried Mediterranean herb while firm, refined tannins provide the framework."
Zibibbo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Donnafugata,39.0,93.0,"Made with 100% dried Zibibbo grapes, this elegant dessert wine offers intense aromas of ripe apricot, lemon jam and acacia honey. The fresh balanced palate doles out juicy layers of tangerine zest, candied fig and a touch of cinnamon."
Zinfandel,US,California,Elyse,39.0,93.0,"Sourced from the Teldeschi and Ramazzotti vineyards, with 12% Petite Sirah and 6% Carignane, this impressively bold, inky wine is undeniably pretty on the nose, recalling strawberries and cherries. Juicy, big and delicious, it has memorable structure and elegance that balances the ripeness of its fruit."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Michele Chiarlo,39.0,93.0,"A lovely medley of iris, violet, mature berry and cake spice aromas emerge on this polished, structured wine. The elegant palate doles out juicy Morello cherry, black raspberry, white pepper, chopped herb and a licorice note while firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. It's still tightly wound and needs time to fully develop. Drink 2018–2027."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Burgenland,Umathum,39.0,93.0,"Once coaxed out of the glass, there is something ethereal about this Pinot Noir in its compelling, lifted nose of elderberry, wild raspberry and aromatic nettle. It is deceptively light on the surface with translucent veils of silky tannins that draw you in. While there is engaging verve right now, this will come into its own once time has revealed the deeper layers of fruit. Drink from 2016."
Syrah,US,California,Wrath,39.0,93.0,"From a vineyard adjacent to the Santa Lucia Highlands, this wine's wondrous nose of dense black currants, blueberries and fresh-cracked black pepper is made even more complex by black olive, gamy roasted meats and chaparral notes. Black pepper thrives on the palate in this cool-climate study, with touches of asphalt, elderberry fruit, charred meat and licorice all playing supportive roles."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Domaine J. Meuret,39.0,93.0,"It takes a precision winemaker to craft a Pinot Noir with such detail from a cool vintage in a cool region. Jon Meuret (founder of Maison Bleue) has the right stuff, as this new project demonstrates. Drink it now for its pure raspberry and cranberry fruit, its lightly rendered oak, its length and texture. Or wait 8–10 years and watch it develop into a complex, elegant wine with mature fruit and polished, terroir-driven flavors. Drink now through 2026."
Grenache,US,California,Seven Oxen,39.0,93.0,"Made in a powerful and thick Paso Robles style, this unique bottling offers cherry syrup, nutmeg, rhubarb and crushed graphite aromas. Baked blueberry pie flavors show on the palate, loaded with mace and spice cake notes. Its tannic texture builds over time, adding to the depth."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,39.0,93.0,"A shy nose with a hint of citrus leads onto a palate with equally restrained flavors. This wine is all about texture and dryness. The superfine mousse is exquisitely creamy, playing off ripe lemon freshness against a softly autolytic background suggesting oatmeal with hints of white pepper. This is unshowy but conveys understated elegance. It finishes beautifully dry and fresh."
Chardonnay,US,California,Williams Selyem,39.0,93.0,"The fruit is sourced from multiple vineyards across the appellation, including Eastside Estate, a vineyard formerly known as 3 Starrs recently purchased by the producer. Aromas of exotic plumeria provide an inviting entry, followed by a subtle, yet lightly rich expression of yellow apple and ample minerality. Everything combines for a balanced wine that's not overly heavy or overripe."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Adams Bench,39.0,93.0,"This is finished in a dense, dark, super-saturated style, and aged in two thirds new French oak barrels. Grainy, smoky, ripe tannins wrap around deep cassis, black cherry and black olive, with occasional whiffs of truffle. For those who love a blockbuster style, this wine rocks. Just a little heat in the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Woodward Canyon,39.0,93.0,"All hand-harvested and hand-sorted, this is a spectacular effort—racy, sharp-edged, showing a steely, stony definition that is rare in the New World. Woodward Canyon wines need time and reward cellaring, but that is not to say that these wines cannot be savored when young. It's just that they will improve dramatically with time. Here are intimations of herb, olive, bark, pepper, tobacco and clove. It's a truly gorgeous wine, rarified and tight."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,Prinz Salm,39.0,93.0,"A steely edge sharpens this perfumed, blossomy Riesling full of ripe white peach and apricot flavors. Dry in style, it's rich and weighty on the palate with a penetrating, powerful finish. Drinks beautifully now, but likely to improve through at least 2021."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Portal,39.0,93.0,"Always a powerful wine, this has the added benefit of being produced from a fine vintage, yielding a hugely dense and concentrated bottling. Power comes from the ripe blackberry and black currant fruit and from the dark, firm tannins. Age this wine at least five years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta Seara d'Ordens,39.0,93.0,"Still young, this wine is firm and structured. It shows great concentration from the tannins and the rich blackberry fruits. With the acidity and the mineral texture, it is classic Douro, needing some more time. Drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,Oregon,Sineann,39.0,93.0,"These Pines Vineyard vines are nearing a century in age. In the new vintage, the wine seems almost brutally powerful, with rough, rugged oak flavors that will want further bottle age to mellow. Ripe blueberry and cherry tones are matched to strong streaks of caramel, cocoa and coconut. Drink 2018–25."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Emmerich Knoll,39.0,93.0,"Superb, rich, fruited wine that has an intense creamy character to go with spice and ripe apples, peach and greengage. It has great elegance, a very stylish character, keeping the richness beautifully in balance. Age this wine for 3–4 years."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Esporão,39.0,93.0,"This is one of a series of limited-production single-variety wines from this large Alentejo estate. Ripe spice and bold juicy flavors, both the hallmark of Alicante Bouschet, give this wine its richness and concentration. It is generous, opulent and just ready to drink."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre,39.0,93.0,"One of the most familiar and best situated Premier Crus, this vineyard has produced a fine and ripe wine from the fruity, crisp 2014 vintage. It's lively, bright, textured and still packed with citrus and apple fruit. Drink now."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,39.0,93.0,"An exemplary rendition of the RR reserve bottling, this vintage is loaded with honey and spice. Smooth, off-dry, complex and full bodied, it's in perfect balance between sweetness and tang, mixing fruit and skin components with that succulence. Lively and energetic, it's delicious now but will benefit from age. Drink through 2030."
Zibibbo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Donnafugata,39.0,93.0,"Made from 100% dried Zibibbo grapes, this classic dessert wine opens with intense raw apricot, date and orange marmalade aromas. It's fresh, full-bodied and elegant on palate, with layers of ripe fig, tangerine zest, chestnut honey and eucalyptus flavors that persist long into the finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Le Vigne,39.0,93.0,"This ripe, attractive wine leads with notes of red and black cherries, dried sage, crushed violets and pipe smoke on the fragrant, herbal nose. Once sipped, it's light and lofty for such a dense-smelling wine, with well-spiced cherry flavors and easy-to-enjoy tannins on the palate."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Fog Crest,39.0,93.0,"Strong, earthy and herbal, this dances in wild strawberry and dark cherry that's concentrated in texturally pleasing layers leading up to a potent, spicy finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine l'Ancienne Cure,39.0,93.0,"This is a dark purple colored wine, packed with tannins that come both from the rich fruit and new wood used in aging. It's still a young wine with black fruits showing strongly through the structure. Powerful and concentrated, it will age well over many years."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Schramsberg,39.0,93.0,"This proves that sparkling wine does not have to be bone-dry to be sophisticated. Although moderately sweet, it is complex in aroma, elegant in texture and balance, rich in flavor and long on the finish. An appealing fresh-bread aroma leads to rich poached-pear flavors. This will be great with an after-dinner cheese course."
Red Blend,US,California,Kynsi,39.0,93.0,"An intriguing, eye-opening blend of Grenache and Pinot Noir, this shows stewed strawberry, black cardamon, clove and wet slate on the nose. Flavors of deeply ripe strawberries mesh with black pepper, soy, potpourri and dried purple flowers on the juicy but tight palate."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Hudson Vineyards,39.0,93.0,"This is an estate-grown blend of 80% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 5% Viognier from the great vineyard site, savory in spicy white pepper, blueberry and a persistence of cinnamon and clove. Floral aromas and a delicate texture provide a memorable experience on the palate, finishing in a tease of tobacco."
Red Blend,US,California,Kynsi,39.0,93.0,"This ode to the owls that surround the region's vineyard is a compelling mix of Pinot Noir and Grenache that offers juicy cherries and strawberries on the nose alongside smoked meat, allspice, nutmeg and a touch of caramel. The flavors are broad, inviting and rich, with black cherry, blueberry and smoked beef. It's as delicious as it is avant garde."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Ellevin,39.0,93.0,"Crisp and firmly structured, this wine is textured with acidity and minerality. The apple, pear and lime flavors are shot through with this steely character that is still integrating in this concentrated wine. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Chehalem,39.0,93.0,"Delightfully piercing and pungent, the brambly bouquet features a little oak-driven caramel to soften up the leather and smoke elements. The mouthfeel is big and cushy, and at first there’s lots of vanillin on the red-fruit palate. With breathing, it really opens up and comes together, showing complexity and style galore. Drink now or within three years."
Syrah,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Esk Valley,39.0,93.0,"Rich, velvety and intense, this is packed with gorgeous mulberry and spice aromas and flavors, with intriguing hints of tar and espresso. Senior Winemaker Gordon Russell deserves much credit for crafting such a voluptuous expression of Hawke's Bay Syrah. Drink now–2025."
Sangiovese,US,California,Cloak & Dagger,39.0,93.0,"There's an elegant blend of red cherry, rose petal and purple-flower aromas on the nose of this wine. The palate is even more exquisitely layered, with espresso, dark red cherry, black plum, mission fig, North African spice and a touch of mint, all hung on a solid tannic structure."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,39.0,93.0,"The core of the “K” range, this wine shows its wood and tannins right up front. It's certainly powerful, with a sense of concentrated black fruits behind the firm and dry structure. A dark and brooding wine, this has enormous potential, so give it at least six years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Durham-Agrellos,39.0,93.0,"An impressive wine, with spice, intense ripe black berry fruits and a solid core of tannins. It has power without being overwhelming, densely textured and ready to age for several years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Joseph Jewell,39.0,93.0,"Joseph Jewell's 2009 Elk Prairie is even better than its 2008, which is saying something. This vintage opens with perfumed cola spice and cinnamon that evolves in its lightly textured, lush mouthfeel into decadent strawberry in crème Anglaise. Bright, with a lingering finish, this Pinot Noir only gets better while in the glass."
Chardonnay,US,California,Beringer,39.0,93.0,"Heady oak aromas lead the nose of this silky, rich wine sourced from a cool site on the producer's own Big Ranch Vineyard at the southern end of the valley. Golden honey notes add to its luxurious nature, contrasting the linear infusion of tart lemon zest, orange peel and nutty spice flavors."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Vilano,39.0,93.0,"Aromas of molasses, wood grain, blackberry and cassis are alluring. Bright, bold and energetic across the palate, this Crianza from a warm, dry year offers toasty oak, chocolate, spice, licorice and black-fruit flavors. As it moves towards the finish, toasty, blackened notes along with hints of mocha rise up. Drink from 2018–2028."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,39.0,93.0,"The HJW Vineyard bottling shares the same backbone of mineral and citrus purity common to the producer's entire 2014 Riesling lineup, but with far greater intensity and penetration. Blossomy and perfumed at first, its grapefruit flavor and honed, steely density build on the palate with elegance and power."
Red Blend,Spain,Spain Other,Valquejigoso,39.0,93.0,"The vineyards to the immediate south of Madrid rarely produce wines like this, which is a blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. Fully toasted, creamy aromas of fine oak accent plum and berry scents entice the nose, while this feels fresh, fruity and structured. Saucy plum and berry flavors deliver a savory aftertaste, while the finish impresses via exquisite balance, elegant dryness and spicy fruit flavors. Drink through 2022."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Olivier,39.0,93.0,"This has smooth, rich fruit, with sweet berries, ripe tannins and strong layers of wood. The wine is powerful; the stalky and bitter chocolate edge contrasts the sweet, ripe fruit. This is meant for long-term aging."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,39.0,93.0,"The nose wants to reveal next to nothing of this rich complex wine, but the palate hints at future glory. This is as tightly closed as a firm fist, but the rich fluidity of the palate is undeniable. There are glimpses of juicy yellow pear while dark flinty spice thunders in the background. Drink 2018–2025."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Wrights Station,39.0,93.0,"Herbal and chaparral-driven, this bottling from a specific estate block shows bay leaf, thyme, oregano and menthol notes against a ripe cranberry aromatic base. The earthy palate offers beet, rhubarb, oregano, marjoram and anise. Camphor, juniper and pine needle kick in toward the finish."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Jalits,39.0,93.0,"A touch of black cherry with the faintest lick of licorice appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent but incredibly juicy.

A cool and profound red, it draws you in with its inherent freshness."
Sparkling Blend,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,39.0,93.0,"A delightful spray of cherry blossoms meanders from nose to finish in this standout Pinot Noir sparkling. Elegantly mouthfilling, it showcases whisper-soft cherry and plum flavors against a dazzling backbone of acidity and minerality. Grace and power synchronize through a long, long finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Baer,39.0,93.0,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah, finished off with Petit Verdot. The aromas and flavors of dried herbs, blackberry, tar and fresh flowers show multiple layers, with the palate displaying density and richness. It needs time to be at its best but will be worth the wait. Drink 2020–2027."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,California,Piocho,39.0,93.0,"This is a cohesive and well-integrated blend of 34% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 9% Petit Verdot and 8% Malbec.

The well-hewn palate combines pepper and blackberry at the tip of the sip, followed by oaky vanilla and a touch of pine. it's very well focused."
White Blend,US,California,B Cellars,39.0,93.0,"This is an unusual blend of 55% Sauvignon Blanc, 39% Chardonnay and 6% Viognier from a selection of fine vineyard sites, including Maldonado. Baked pineapple, mango, anise and lemongrass ride along tightly grained texture and a tension of acidity, finding a manageable weight of viscosity on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Dolin,39.0,93.0,"This Malibu winery's bottling from the historic Bien Nacido vineyard is lush with lemon curd, buttered croissant and brown spice aromas. The palate is both plush and vibrant, its apple cream and poached pear favors enlivened with sea salt, lemon rind and slate accents. It's complex and awesome."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Doren,39.0,93.0,"A tiny-production, 100% varietal wine from a tiny ½-acre site in heart of Kenwood, next to Chateau St. Jean, this is a wow wine, melding flavors of baked plum, moist earth, mocha and blackberry. It has a lively richness that's both lush and expansive, with a soft, firm tannin structure and lengthy finish."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Zusslin,39.0,93.0,"Notes of fresh sourdough rye bread, crisp apples and citrus vie for attention and signal an evolved wine with beautiful notes of long autolysis. This is borne out on the exquisitely pure and fresh palate, still sprightly with lemon and green-apple freshness against a background of bread crust and crumb. Over time, the apple notes mellow and are reminiscent of spiced winter apple. This is marked by exquisite elegance and purity. Without any dosage, this shines with pure, intense and lively fruit."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Suduiraut,39.0,93.0,"Illogically, there are two second wines at this estate. This is the richer of the two (the other is Lions). It has intensity, spice, ripe apricot fruit and a smooth, dense texture. Its honey and botrytis notes are just right while the thread of acidity keeps it all in place. Drink from 2019."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine Coustarret,39.0,93.0,"Sébastian Bordenave-Coustarret has the light touch needed to show the delicacy and great charm of the Petit Manseng grape. With a fine balance between honey and apricot fruits and such poised acidity, the wine is light and fresh as well as ripe. It's wine that will develop slowly, so drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,California,Jamie Slone Wines,39.0,93.0,"Quite light in the glass, this 50-50 blend from La Encanta and La Rinconada vineyards is done in a refreshingly crisp style, with lime pith and nectarine flesh aromas. It's fresh and vibrant on the palate, where tons of chalky grip frame a sizzling lime zest acidity and flavors of river stone and chalk. It's a laser-focused, very tense and nervy wine."
Syrah,US,California,Novy,39.0,93.0,"Adam Lee's bottling from an iconic vineyard offers thick black fruit on the nose as well as fields of fennel and a dense array of purple flowers including lavender. Ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit make for a warm palate, lifted by roasted fennel and lots of tarragon and wild mint."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Montebaco,39.0,93.0,"Blackberry, a hint of raisin, mild char and lemon-peel aromas make for a fine bouquet. This is lively, punchy and chewy, with big tannins. Blackberry, chocolate, loamy earth, toast and peppery flavors finish long, baked, ripe and with the potential for an even better future. Drink through 2021."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sojourn,39.0,93.0,"Clear in color and texture, this is a refined and yet voluptuous wine, a blend from several of the producer's single-vineyard designates, from Ridgetop Vineyard near Annapolis to Gap's Crown within the Petaluma Gap. It works on several levels, retaining the acidity of the cooler sites while combining the deeper, more complex aspects of others. Expect dark cherry and blueberry along a foundation of earthy truffle."
Syrah,US,Washington,Efeste,39.0,93.0,"This is warm region, warm vintage Syrah at its decadent best.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Casca Wines,39.0,93.0,"Old vines in a field blend give a rich structured wine that has dark tannins and powerful black fruits. It is firm, very concentrated with dense fruit as much as dense tannins. This wine could still age another few months, so drink from 2017."
Charbono,US,California,Judd's Hill,38.0,93.0,"What a treat to find a great rendition of this rare varietal. Concentrated black-fruit flavors pair beautifully with aromatic oak accents in this bold and complex wine.

Syrah,US,California,Mesa Del Sol,38.0,93.0,"From a warm-climate zone in a cool vintage, this wine is fascinatingly savory.

Spätburgunder,Germany,Pfalz,Philipp Kuhn,38.0,93.0,"High-impact aromas of sun-ripened blackberries, smoke and char extend throughout this rich, complex Pinot Noir. Blackberry and black cherry flavors are plump and ripe, yet layered with savory herb and mineral tones. It's solid in structure, framed tightly with tannins and should meld beautifully through 2025."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,38.0,93.0,"Finished off dry, this masks its residual sugar with ample acidity. Some portion of the winery's numerous individual Riesling lots is barrel fermented, and here there are unmistakable highlights of caramel. On the palate it's smooth and rich, with wide-open flavors of peach and pear."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,California,Still Waters,38.0,93.0,"The best Still Waters release right now, this presents a sophisticated nose of cherry chutney, black pepper, blueberry and burning sagebrush.

Chardonnay,US,California,Grow Wines,38.0,93.0,"This small-production, single-vineyard white hails from a site at the southern end of the appellation, close to Carneros. It shines in golden apple, honey graham cracker and a rich texture that impresses from start to finish. A floral element persists and intrigues, a mix of wildflower and fennel."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,F X Pichler,38.0,93.0,"On the surface there is brisk, spicy grapefruit zest, while underneath the nose hints at generously ripe apricot and Mirabelle plum. The palate plays off juicy stone fruit and zesty citrus on a sleek, slender, concentrated body. The freshness is brisk and taut, while the fruit is charming and soft. With a slender, sleek and dry mouthfeel, this is just what you want from Riesling."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Bodega de Edgar,38.0,93.0,"From a high desert vineyard in the Cuyama Valley area, this bottling impresses with structure and earthy minerality. Aromas of black rocks, loamy soils and beef crust meet with shreds of elderberry and black plum on the nose.

Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,38.0,93.0,"Racy, lime-tinged acidity cuts a fine edge through this steely, intensely mineral kabinett. On the palate, pristine, honeyed sprays of lemon and tangerine lend a mouthwatering feel. The finish is long, accented by touches of pollen and spice."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,DanCin,38.0,93.0,"This is all Pommard clone Pinot from a vineyard in the McMinnville AVA.

There is lots of chalky texture on the palate and a pointed acidity, presenting exotic flavors of plum, mulberry, pepper spice and a touch of nutmeg."
Chardonnay,US,California,Talley,38.0,93.0,"This is a slightly riper approach from the longtime producer, with browned butter, vanilla, honeyed pineapple and a hint of seared marshmallow on the nose. The palate shows ripe brown pears and caramelized apples that carry deep into the finish. It's a balanced take on this style, never over the top."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Karl Schaefer,38.0,93.0,"Perfumed blossom and apricot aromas are especially appealing here. Dry in style, with a plush pink grapefruit palate, the wine's sharp acidic edges lend verve. The finish is long, marked by a cool, mineral tang. Delicious already, it should hold well through 2025."
Chardonnay,US,California,Patz & Hall,38.0,93.0,"A well-crafted blending from several marquee vineyards within the producer's portfolio, this is a subtle, flirty and floral white, vibrant and dusted in minerality.

Red Blend,France,Provence,Château de Calavon,38.0,93.0,"Solid, ripe, perfumed and tannic, this is a concentrated, dark wine. Hints of mint and wood frame rich black fruits on the palate. It is a powerful wine with a good future, so drink from 2015."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,38.0,93.0,"Intensely slatey, even smoky mineral tones distinguish Maximin Grünhäuser's Abtsberg spätlese from the Herrenberg. It shares the same sweet-tart peach and apricot fruit profile, but it's deeper, reverberating minerality gives the Absberg refined elegance. The finish is zesty and strong."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Schloss Saarstein,38.0,93.0,"Freshness abounds in this invigorating mineral spätlese. It's judiciously sweet, showcasing delicate peach and honey flavors balanced by bracing acidity and complexities of saffron and earth. The finish undulates impressively."
Zinfandel,US,California,Peachy Canyon,38.0,93.0,"This is a unique and exciting take on California's historic grape from one of the region's pioneering wineries.

Zinfandel,US,California,Tres Sabores,38.0,93.0,"From the producer's dry-farmed estate vineyard, this elegantly powerful wine opens in cracked black pepper, dried herb and cedar, continuing the peppery theme on the palate.

Sagrantino,Italy,Central Italy,Cantina Fratelli Pardi,38.0,93.0,"Crushed black raspberry, plum, clove and white pepper are among the inviting aromas of this bold wine. The richly textured palate offers blackberry, mature cherry, black pepper and baking spice. Thanks to smooth, velvety tannins, it seamlessly combines power and grace. Drink 2016–2022."
Red Blend,US,California,Écluse,38.0,93.0,"A nontraditional blend of 44% Zinfandel, 31% Syrah, 15% Merlot and 10% Petite Sirah, this bottling shows tight blueberry, milk chocolate, river rocks and rose petals on the dynamic nose. The palate is juicy with more blueberry and vanilla, but bound by a plum-skin tartness and a decently strong tannic grip."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sarah's Vineyard,38.0,93.0,"This is a fabulous example of a light, balanced wine from the Santa Lucia Highlands, which is perhaps better known for richness. It shows savory aromas of smoked cherries, nose-tickling sage, juniper-laced sausage and cayenne pepper.

Chardonnay,US,California,La Follette,38.0,93.0,"This wine is beautifully floral, with a honeyed touch of apple blossom on the nose. Stony mineral and sea breeze accents add to its complexity, as seductive, smooth layers of creme brûlée and preserved lemon flavor provide oomph and grace."
Tempranillo,US,California,Bodega de Edgar,38.0,93.0,"Impressively dark and dense in the glass, this bottling from Edgar Torres from a coastal site offers pungent black currant, leather, wet asphalt and black pepper aromas. The palate's charred black plum flavors are wrapped in serious tannins and bolstered by bright acidity. This will evolve into a stellar wine with patience. Drink 2020–2034."
Chardonnay,US,California,La Follette,38.0,93.0,"Crisp and balanced in bright acidity and apple skin, this also offers subtle toasted oak and caramel, the best of both worlds, exuberant and elegant at the same time. Enjoy now or cellar until 2020."
Cabernet Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Luigi Bosca,38.0,93.0,"Ripe but subtle aromas of aged balsamic vinegar, blackberry, baked plum and vanilla are alluring and feed into a flush layered palate. Spicy black plum and berry flavors are just rustic and toasty enough, while this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with Cab Franc and Merlot tastes peppery, deep, a touch hot and on the money. Drink from 2018–2026."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Chapel Hill,38.0,93.0,"This winery uses ample amounts of oak, but in years when the fruit concentration matches that intensity the wines can be compelling. Cedar and vanilla notes frame blackberry and cassis fruit in this firmly structured wine that folds in savory notes of roasted beef and black olive on the finish. Drink 2020–2030."
Red Blend,US,California,Pulchella,38.0,93.0,"Baked blackberry, vanilla, dust and chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 22% Grenache and 9% Tannat. The palate is ripe with plum, blueberry and black currant and lifted by dried ginger and nutmeg, but the dazzling acidity and tannic firmness is what takes it to the next level."
Syrah,US,Washington,DeLille,38.0,93.0,"Here is what all the excitement is about:  a Washington Syrah bursting with dense, thick, textured, rich, ripe fruit, yet not too “jammy.” The acids are there to support all that weight, along with generous amounts of oak. The zippy, berry-laden fruit shines through, then the oak kicks in with an abundance of smoke, coffee and licorice notes. Big, sappy, sensuous and flat-out sensational wine. Editors' Choice."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Anglim,38.0,93.0,"More people would crave Mourvèdre if it were done in this style, with light rather than heavy leather scents alongside purple fruits. Once sipped, it hits the tastebuds with blueberry soda, tobacco, licorice, black pepper and wild game, all restrained and juicy rather than brooding and thick."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Derby,38.0,93.0,"From one of the most ocean-adjacent vineyards in the state, this is a swarthy and powerful bottling, showing black plum, violet, olive and coffee touches on the concentrated nose. There is a bracing acidity and upright structure to the palate, while the flavors remain power-driven: stewed plum and hoisin sauce, with an espresso-like finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler,38.0,93.0,"There is a touch of smoke and stone that lends a darker aspect to the ripe but crisp apple fruit. The palate has that same taut but very full-fruited feel—of very tightly held ample fruit reminiscent of red-cheeked, aromatic apples. This is both powerful and svelte. The palate is dry and finishes very clean, leaving you with haunting apple notes and fresh lemon."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin,38.0,93.0,"This is a full-bodied, dense wine. A hint of austerity in the mineral texture gives the wine a steely core. Around this center, ripe fruit fills out the wine and gives apricots and generous fruitiness as well as a crisp, perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Syrah,US,California,Frequency,38.0,93.0,"Black currant, lavender, black pepper, soy and graphite show on the nose of this bottling by Zac Wasserman, an assistant to Joey Tensley. There is a flash of lavender at the tip of the sip, and then the darkness descends, with charred meats and blackened berries cut by a strong acidity. It still needs time to develop, but these wines disappear fast, so stock up."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Seven Oxen,38.0,93.0,"Very fresh and inviting aromas of blueberry, plum, rich rose petal and vanilla bean show on the nose of this blend of 65% Grenache, 30% Mourvèdre and 5% Tannat. Once sipped, mulberry, vanilla and red cherry mesh with lavish clove and baking spice, creating an elegant and layered wine."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Ponzi,38.0,93.0,"From the estate's original vines planted in 1978, this exceptional wine envelops the palate with layers of richness not often found in Pinot Gris. It's lush and seductive, with hints of honeycomb, brown butter, toasted peanut and dried apricot. The flavors persist, and lovely details keep it interesting through the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Stark,38.0,93.0,"A bright, fresh Syrah delicious in restrained blackberry and blueberry fruit, it has a luscious mouthfeel, plenty of acidity and an undercurrent of wild herb. Stark managed to do good things with many varieties in 2011. This wine is a standout, ready to pair with something gamey dribbled in black pepper sauce."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Domaine Eden,38.0,93.0,"This Cab shows intensely pure blueberry fruit alongside cocoa, sandalwood, dried scarlet rosebuds, leather and pencil shavings on the nose. Very savory on the palate with restrained fruit, this offers crushed oregano, marjoram, thyme, black pepper, sea salt, soy and miso flavors. It's pleasantly approachable and enjoyable now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Montemar Wines,38.0,93.0,"This is a tip-top appellation blend from a winery based in the Lompoc Wine Ghetto, showing fresh-pressed raspberries, fennel pollen, dried rose petals and hibiscus on the nose. It's tightly wound on the spicy palate, with light cranberry, thyme, marjoram and Earl Grey tea flavors."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,38.0,93.0,"Rather austere whiffs of lemon, lime and pine on the nose of this medium-sweet Spätlese belie the fruity mélange of grapefruit and guava that awaits on the palate. It's dainty in mouthfeel, yet buoyant and penetrating in sweet citrus, honey and melon flavors. The finish draws out dramatically, meandering on a murmur of tea tannins."
Chardonnay,US,California,Davis Family,38.0,93.0,"Dark gold in color and mightily textured, this lovely wine is medium-bodied and salty in pear, mango an pineapple. The flavors are subdued and nuanced, finding their way within layers of acidity and refined oak."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Rieflé,38.0,93.0,"This is rich, full of spicy fruit, apricot juice and white peaches. The fruits are topped by an unctuous honey character that pushes the wine towards sweetness while keeping a fresh flavor in the background. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),38.0,93.0,"Honey tangerines and freesias perfume this dazzling auslese that's full of pristine yellow peach and citrus flavors. It's luscious, almost opulent with fruit, but cut with a shock of lemon-lime acidity that extends the long, long finish."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Arrocal,38.0,93.0,"Elegant yet ripe on the nose, this gets going in fine form via spicy, exotic, oaky aromas on top of primary berry tones. Powerful and oaky on the palate, with a creamy vanilla flavor, this brings on the blackberry, mocha, cocoa and toast as it works its way to a clean, long finish. One can drink this now, but the optimum window will be 2018–2021."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Muruve,38.0,93.0,"A top-flight Toro that knows how to step on the gas but keep the car centered. Aromas of dried lavender, violets, coffee and black fruit come together marvelously, while the palate is dark as Mud Cake but still loaded with tasty blackberry and black currants. Pure and strapping, and giving all the oomph that Toro is known for."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Seven Hills,38.0,93.0,"A blend of 33% Merlot (from the original, 1976 block), 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Petit Verdot and 13% Cab Franc, this shows Euro-style refinement from first sniff to last swallow. The alcohol has climbed up a bit without any sacrifice of detail. A mix of berries, cherries and cassis, the fruits are woven around tightly defined, perfectly ripened tannins, with an underlayer of acid and mineral."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Peter Lauer,38.0,93.0,"Delicate floral notes mingle with smoke and struck flint on this gorgeously composed Riesling sparkling. The palate is delicately pétillant with soft, tiny bubbles that fill the mouth with layers of caramelized sugar, fresh pears, blossom and minerals. Striking acidity drives a long, umami-touched finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Kaleidos,38.0,93.0,"Rich notes of black currant, black cherries, pressed violets and a shred of tar show on the nose of this wine by Steve Martell of Sextant. The small-batch blend of 83% Syrah, 13% Grenache and 4% Mourvèdre mixes concentrated berries with dark chocolate, espresso beans, peppercorns and crushed herbs on the palate."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Benovia,38.0,93.0,"Subtle and shy at first, exhibiting light aromas of rose petal, this wine unveils slowly to reveal complex elements of cinnamon, red and black cherry—a curious commingling that comes together nicely. From several vineyards, including Martinelli, it's medium bodied and lengthy, with plenty of earthiness to the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Montemaggiore,38.0,93.0,"A rustic, French countryside kind of a wine, this is deliciously reflective of a cooler vintage and the nuances the variety can display in the right hands. Meat and a shaker's worth of pepper make for a savory, sauvage taste experience that's soft in texture and exotic, with a powerful bite of tannin on the finish."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Still Waters,38.0,93.0,"Scents of sesame oil rise to the forefront of the nose on this east Paso Robles estate wine, accompanied by violet, strawberry and black sage. The nicely balanced flavors touch upon cotton candy and pretty pink fruit."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta Monteti,38.0,93.0,"A blend of 55% Petit Verdot, 25% Cabernet Franc and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with raspberry, black plum, orange zest and cocoa aromas that follow through to the full-bodied palate. Polished tannins lend a smooth, creamy texture. Enjoy through 2021."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Theopolis,38.0,93.0,"Black pepper and boysenberries put oomph into this dark-colored and firmly structured wine. While vivid and concentrated, the fruit, spice and dark-chocolate flavors are not sweet, but beautifully dry and appetizing, made to pair with a rare steak or tender osso buco. It will drink best from 2019."
Riesling,US,Washington,Dunham,38.0,93.0,"This lightly cloudy wine displays aromas of orange marmalade, candied pear and citrus peel. Honeyed dried apple and pear flavors display exquisite balance and length."
Malbec,US,Washington,Woodinville Wine Cellars,38.0,93.0,"One of the finest Malbecs ever made in Washington, this pure varietal wine, sourced entirely from the Conner Lee Vineyard, is deeply concentrated with raspberry and loganberry fruit. Intense and structured for aging, it retains its clear, pure focus right on through an exceptionally long finish."
Grenache,US,California,Frequency,38.0,93.0,"Vibrant aromas of raspberry, tart cherry, lavender, red flowers and freshly plucked garden herbs show on the pretty nose of this bottling by Zac Wasserman. The sip starts with a touch of unexpected red-fruit richness, then rides waves of sandalwood, dried rose petals and thyme. The acidity is mouthwatering and the tannins a bit sticky. Altogether it is both light and lively."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Casca Wines,38.0,93.0,"A powerful, full-bodied and rich wine. Its tannins are already well balanced, layered within the dense black fruit. The wood aging brings hints of bitter chocolate and spice to go with its impressive fruit. This is a wine for aging over the next 4–5 years."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Wolf Blass,38.0,93.0,"This wine is an excellent value in the world of big, rich Shiraz. While the vanilla and boysenberry aromas seem simple at first, the bouquet and flavors develop impressively with time in the glass, adding hints of roasted meat, mocha and black olive. It's full bodied and rich in texture, with a long, mouth-coating finish. Drink now–2025."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf,38.0,93.0,"High-toned tangerine and lime acidity cuts a sharp edge through this intensely ripe yet composed dry wine. It's zesty and green, but boasts rich yellow plum, melon and grapefruit flavors. It's delicious already but should continue to meld beautifully through 2025."
Roussanne,US,Washington,Doyenne,38.0,93.0,"This stunner of a wine brings notes of nut oil, ripe, fresh-off-the-tree peach and mouthwatering apricot. It's nectarous and rich with a rounded feel and abundant sweet fruit flavors that linger. Terrific stuff—a benchmark for the variety in the state."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf,38.0,93.0,"While it shares the same electricity and mineral finesse of Bürklin-Wolf's other 2014 Premier Cru (labeled P.C.) wines, the Rechbächel has an intensely fruity, almost tropical appeal. It's concentrated and ripe, but with cutting white grapefruit and tangerine acidity leading a long, focused finish. Drink now through 2025."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ayoub,38.0,93.0,"The entry-level Pinot in the Ayoub lineup would be the top cuvée for any number of wineries. Full and fruity, with rich cherry flavors backed with defining minerality, it's powerful, deep and immaculately clear."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Winderlea,38.0,93.0,"Once again Winderlea's outstanding Chardonnay is a blend of grapes sourced from Carabella, Hyland and Thistle. Immaculate winemaking builds a full-bodied wine, lushly flavored with apples, peaches and citrus. The concentrated midpalate is framed with skin flavors and toasty oak, lightly applied."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,38.0,93.0,"Apart from its quite heavy bottle, this is a fine wine. It has great black plum and berry aromas that are balanced by wood aging. The tannins, direct, firm and dense, bring out the best in the juicy fruitiness and give shape. At the end, this structure, combined with acidity, promise good aging. Drink from 2016."
Red Blend,US,California,Parducci,38.0,93.0,"This is an exceptionally concentrated, smooth and delicious wine. It has ripe blueberry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, and its texture strikes the right balance between supple and tannic. A Coro Mendocino blend, it's made from a base of Zinfandel, with Petite Sirah, Syrah and a dash of Grenache. Delicious now, it also has the stuffing to age. Best from 2018."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Boeckel,38.0,93.0,"Subtle hints of tart apples appear first, then there is the merest touch of quince, even a touch of lemon balm. The palate pans out aromatically, always in that apple and quince spectrum, and has a brightening crisp edge of freshness and absolute concentration and dryness. With more air, the aromatic lemon balm note adds its special perfume to this wine. This is invigorating and enlivening."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Flying Goat Cellars,38.0,93.0,"Norm Yost presents luscious and broad aromas of black currant candies, black slate and well-integrated clove and allspice aromas on this wine from an extreme coastal slice of the Central Coast. It's quite boisterous for the restrained vintage, with blood, iodine, black cherry juice and black pepper flavors."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,38.0,93.0,"Intense freshness and acidity follow the most delicious perfumes in this crisp wine. It shows considerable minerality, bursting with citric flavors and a mouthwatering aftertaste. Age for several years. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Vrignaud,38.0,93.0,"The fruit here is pure, fresh with the merest hints of its future richness. The green fruits, citrus and acidity are prominent, with a hint of toast and a finishing line of minerality. It needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,38.0,93.0,"This golden wine confounds in a mix of wet stone and caramel on the nose, the body creamy in vanilla. Fuller in style and body than some, it remains balanced in acidity and tangy citrus, maintaining a freshness and brightness throughout. The finish is intense with more of that citrus, plus an accent of ginger and lemongrass."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Goat Bubbles,38.0,93.0,"Vigorous bubbles present a Pinot Noir-like nose of crushed rocks, Indian spice and sour earth on one of the best Central Coast sparklers of the vintage. The intriguing flavors center on pluot and nectarine flesh, with fringes of salinity, lemon juice, cardamom and even dashes of curry."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Domdechant Werner,38.0,93.0,"There's so much body and ripeness in this bold, dry-style Riesling, it's admittedly blousy, but irresistibly so. Voluptuous and alcoholic on the palate, it shows intensely concentrated peach and cantaloupe flavors, as well as a sensual, almost oily, mineral richness. It may not age for decades but offers plenty of hedonistic enjoyment through 2021."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),38.0,93.0,"Pristine orange blossom and tangerine hints turn riper and richer on the palate in this delicately honeyed Riesling. It's lively and deft in mouthfeel, with sweet yellow cherry and peach flavors that dart on the midpalate. A sun-filled yet gorgeously balanced wine, it's calibrated by scintillating acidity and a mineral sheen on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,St. Rose,38.0,93.0,"Light in color it's composed of violet and rose petal aromas, zippy in acidity, with layered dark cherry fruit and an earthy, herbal backbone. With texture on the palate, it has a buoyancy and electricity of minerality and finishes with the slightest suggestion of anise. Only 72 cases were made."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Spottswoode,38.0,93.0,"Grapes are meticulously sourced from a range of sites, including Sonoma Mountain and Knights Valley on the Sonoma side, and Spottswoode estate, Hyde and Ink Grade from Napa. Opening with the aromas of grassy knoll, it develops in the glass to show juicy, fresh acidity and well-defined flavors of apricot and wet stone. Young and bright, the acidity is tenacious and supportive, making way for a final lilt of creaminess on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,38.0,93.0,"Distinctive and precise, this well-priced wine should have a place in your cellar. It captures the specific characteristics—terroir if you will—that distinguish the best Willamette Valley Pinot Noirs: highlights of cola and herb, refreshing minerality, a perfect balance of fruit, acid and tannin, and a riveting liveliness in the mouth. All this without any hint of new oak makes this a winemaking tour de force."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Winderlea,38.0,93.0,"The Carabella, Hyland and Thistle vineyards continue to be the fruit sources for this gorgeous wine that's tart and stylish. The well-blended flavors mix citrus, tea, mineral and toast, and the length is impressive. Drink through 2025."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,The Setting,38.0,93.0,"This barrel-fermented white wine from Jesse Katz of Devil Proof and Aperture Wines is impressively layered and complex. A reductive whiff of petrol leads on the nose yet the palate is juicy, showing a wealth of peach skin and green apple. A bite of acidity supports its fresh, fruity core."
Red Blend,US,California,The Tribe,38.0,93.0,"This lovely blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Grenache is hearty and robust, with lavender, garrigue, black pepper and cinnamon aromas. Its velvety texture gives way to rich blueberry cobbler flavors peppered with firewood smoke notes, recalling a winter's night."
Chardonnay,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,38.0,93.0,"Crafted from six vineyards within the Dutton family's holdings, this is a pretty wine, smooth and supple with a balance of acidity and light body. Citrus and apple vie for attention with a slight tropical note and expansiveness of ginger cookie and toffee."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,38.0,93.0,"A curious whiff of lemon pastry entices on the nose of this sprightly wine. The palate is intensely ripe, bursting with sweet honeysuckle nectar and tangerine, yet it's almost lacy in texture, cut by a spray of green-apple acidity. It's delicious already, but sure to hold well for another decade."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Refugio Ranch,38.0,93.0,"Roasted beef, black cherry, rainbow peppercorn, dried lavender and a touch of rosemary arise on the nose of this blend of 51% Grenache, 39% Syrah and 10% Petite Sirah. There is lots of pizzaz to the palate, where rose petals, ripe plums, rosewater and aromatic spices show on the sip."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,38.0,93.0,"The enthralling intensity of fruit and minerality in this sprightly wine make it well worth cellaring. On the nose, it's still quite closed, with smoky tones of struck flint and slate. An explosion of rich mango, pineapple and stone fruit flavors await on the palate, highlighted by a spine-tingling spray of acidity. It's deliciously wild now but should gain depth and elegance from 2021."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Jaffurs,38.0,93.0,"Though younger than most current Petite Sirah releases, this bottling impresses wildly with fragrant boysenberries and crushed lavender on the nose, proving to be a floral-driven style that's not beaten down by richness or ripeness, despite the higher alcohol level that doesn't show at all. Insane amounts of cracked white and black pepper meet with toasted sesame seeds, tart boysenberries and more lavender on the palate."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,38.0,93.0,"The heady lift of lemon oil hits you first. Next comes a dry, slender palate full of apple flavors: crunchy and red, crisp and green, baked and mellow. This is so juicy and light, yet also concentrated and punchy, expressing laser-sharp Riesling at its best. The wine is poised and has a precise liquid vein of bright acidity before finishing with chalky stoniness. Drink now until 2030."
Chardonnay,US,California,McIntyre Vineyards,38.0,93.0,"Toast, lightly roasted Marcona almonds, a touch of hazelnut and hints of melon and lemon blossom converge on the nose of this delicious and cleanly made wine. The flavors are savory, full of lemon zest and sea salt, hinged together by lines of well-rounded acidity. It would pair with everything from lighter fish dishes to smoked chicken."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Aequorea,38.0,93.0,"Aaron Jackson blends extreme coastal vineyards from Cayucos, Cambria, Pismo Beach and San Simeon into this wondrous wine, which shows blackberries, black cherries, damp fennel and wisps of blood on the nose. Mashed plums and Bing cherries emerge on the palate, along with black olives, elderflowers and a coyote brush grip."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Musso,38.0,93.0,"Initially closed, this eventually offers alluring aromas of toasted hazelnut, exotic spice, steeped plum and nutmeg. The chewy palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, baking spice, vanilla and a hint of coffee alongside velvety tannins that lend polished support and a smooth mouthfeel. Drink through 2023."
Syrah,US,California,Francis Coppola,38.0,93.0,"White and black pepper jump out of the glass, calling to the senses in this wine from the Wallace Creek Vineyard. A complex tangle of body and texture interweaves between an underlying elegance that belies the considerable ripeness behind this wine."
Syrah,US,Washington,Sparkman,38.0,93.0,"Almost impenetrably dark, this juicy Syrah includes 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The Red Mountain fruit brings a blast of boysenberry and black cherry fruit, heightened with citrusy acidity. It's an expression of pure fruit power, with barrel notes of black coffee and tannins that taste of wet rock. This is a wine that should have a good decade of life ahead."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Mercy,38.0,93.0,"From a vineyard that's bisected by a seasonal creek comes another excellent showing from this vintage, with black slate, lightly smoked blackberries and bloody iron on the nose. The palate is quite lush, with more smoke, brambly berries and roasted fennel, all clinging to a strong graphite core."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fess Parker,37.0,93.0,"Bright, fresh and vivacious, this bottling from the historic vineyard offers white flowers, sea salt, lemons and buttered white peaches on the nose. Apple flesh and lime rind sizzles into the citrus-driven palate, where a touch of lemon verbena adds complexity to this straightforward and delicious wine."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Weninger,37.0,93.0,"Fleshy cherry fruit becomes immediately apparent, while on the palate the fruit acquires a spicy edge of appetizing white pepper. This is lip-smackingly fresh, even tart, but in a very appetizing, bracing way that will mellow with another year or two in bottle. The fruit is crunchy and juicy, the tannins are ripe and fine and wood smoke hovers deliciously."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Chapel Hill,37.0,93.0,"Powerful and concentrated, this Shiraz is seemingly imbued with the essence of dark fruit, framed by well-managed oak. Cedar, mint and cassis notes are a bit Cabernet-like, but the structure is pure Shiraz, broader and suppler than Cabernet, with a rich texture and a long finish. Drink now–2025."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Jean Sipp,37.0,93.0,"There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Roger & Christophe Moreux,37.0,93.0,"From one of the most famous vineyard slopes in Sancerre, the wine is tight, structured and still young. It has great potential with rich citrus, herbs and green fruit flavors. Along with the tense, mineral texture, the wine has both concentration and aging ability. Drink from 2019."
Macabeo,Spain,Catalonia,Agustí Torelló Mata,37.0,93.0,"This is superb Cava, no ifs, ands or buts. Soft, yeasty, complex aromas of bready apple and spice feed into a round, yeasty palate. Bready flavors of pear, papaya and mango end with stony minerality and a closing note of lime."
Merlot,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,37.0,93.0,"L'Ecole is one of the three partners in the Seven Hills vineyard, and sources its grapes from some of the oldest vines. The blend includes 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, tight and spicy at first, then opening into a deeply flavored, brambly wine with a vivid mix of berry and stone. Firm tannins anchor it solidly and the overall structure suggests it could age for at least a decade, maybe two."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Herdade do Rocim,37.0,93.0,"In its powerful, heavy bottle, this is a powerful, rich wine that is impressively dense and concentrated. Ripe red and black fruit flavors mingle alongside dark chocolate tones, supported by structured tannins. Age this impressive wine and drink after 2015."
Syrah,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,37.0,93.0,"A pure varietal blend from the estate vineyard, this has everything you look for in Walla Walla Syrah—black fruits, loam, graphite, balsamic—and an inviting scent of orange liqueur. Licorice, iron and a concentrated, muscular depth elevate the finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,37.0,93.0,"Rich, with a taut, minerally, steely texture, this wine has a fine perfumed character, with notes of white spring flower, intense quince, pear and white currant. The bright acidity adds lift to this concentrated, age-worthy effort."
Meritage,US,California,Leoness,37.0,93.0,"Black loam and black cherry darkness are met with a minty lift, coffee grinds and cigar leaf on this blend of 57% Merlot, 27% Cabernet Franc, 12% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon. There are solid tannins and lots of vibrancy on the palate, followed by flavors of fresh red cherries, black peppery spice and dried meats on the finish."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Riojanas,37.0,93.0,"Aromas of roasted earth, leather and fine oak are more out-front than berry fruit, and that's the way it should be for a Gran Reserva. This feels bold, lively and still a touch bumpy. Chocolaty oak and vanilla notes rest comfortably on top of ripe berry and black-plum flavors, while the finish is persistently earthy and chocolaty. Drink through 2028."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Sangenís I Vaqué,37.0,93.0,"This ripe holdover from 2006 proves that Priorat wines can age well. This wine is full of licorice, spice cake and other heady aromas, while the palate is lush and chewy, but still hanging in there. Flavors of black fruits, chocolate, burnt toast, black coffee and licorice finish dense and long. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,Australia,Victoria,Jasper Hill,37.0,93.0,"This is a dry, fairly full-bodied Riesling that's approachable now, but should hold well through at least 2024. It's fairly dark in hue for a young white wine, with smoky notes of grilled toast, honey and citrus that linger on the lip-smacking finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Sheldon,37.0,93.0,"Made in even smaller amounts than the vintage before it, this combines 90% Petite Sirah with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from old head-pruned vines. The winemakers succeeded in coaxing fruity raspberry and blackberry around a fully brazen acidity that explodes on the palate. Softly textured, the wine is incredibly fragrant and inviting in white pepper."
White Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Heidi Schröck,37.0,93.0,"Wonderfully heady notes of berries preserved in spirit, with vague hints of dried apple slices, strike a sonorous note, with a seemingly more grown-up sweetness, tempered by almost autumnal flavors of cinnamon. A rounded but totally precise body speaks of purity, which is only highlighted by glimpses of very ripe, yellow Mirabelle plums. A very elegant BA."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Johannisberger,37.0,93.0,"Squeaky-fresh lemon and lime shine a spotlight against sweet melon and stone fruit flavors in this gossamer-textured spätlese. It's dancingly delicate, yet deeply penetrating on the palate, finishing on lingering notes of hazelnut and white flowers."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Glaetzer,37.0,93.0,"This has gone up in price over the years, but it's still a solid, relatively affordable example of Barossa Valley Shiraz. This is youthful and edgy, with meaty, savory notes accenting mixed berries and a hint of mint. The finish is a bit chewy right now, but mouthcoating and long."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Leithaberg,Tinhof,37.0,93.0,"The slightest and most haunting aromatic promise is made on the nose. The palate does not disappoint and follows up in waves of fruit-tinged petals and floral fruitiness. The texture is taut, dense and packed with crushed blueberry and cherry, yet there is a lightness of touch and an unforced charm that make this very, very attractive. Freshness and white pepper add the finishing touches. Lovely."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Sébastien Dampt,37.0,93.0,"From a 2.4-acre vineyard with vines that are 60 years old, this is a tight, mineral wine, very pure and with a line of acidity and crisp apple flavors. Very perfumed, it is fresh but also densely textured, finishing with tannins and concentration as well as liveliness. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fess Parker,37.0,93.0,"There's a sharp element of lime rind and brie cheese skin at first sniff of this wine, but the nose quickly softens into white peach elements. Once sipped, the citrus pith tightness remains, and while it doesn't veer into juicy ripeness, there are supple apple and pear fruit flavors, cut further with lemon juice on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fess Parker,37.0,93.0,"There's a touch of soft cheese rind at first on the nose of this wine from the historic vineyard. It quickly emerges into a gray slate and white rock minerality, followed by warmed pears and apples. It's tightly focused on the steely, tense palate, with lime sorbet and green pear ripeness and a sunny body."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Joh. Jos. Prüm,37.0,93.0,"Heady aromas of rose petal, red berry and tropical fruit lend an unusual expressiveness to this delicately framed kabinett. Dainty and dancing, the texture is almost ethereal, finishing long, with a lacy swath of berries and blossoms."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Patricia Green Cellars,37.0,93.0,"The biggest production and lowest priced of all the winery's vineyard designates, this is sexy, substantial and one of the best offerings from any winery sourcing fruit from this exceptional vineyard. A riot of berries, plums and Asian spices fills the mouth—well-integrated, layered and detailed right on through the extended finish. A light dusting of cocoa powder lingers and invites the next sip."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Gianfranco Alessandria,37.0,93.0,"Black-skinned berry, grilled herb and balsamic aromas meld together in the glass. On the ripe juicy palate, notes of cinnamon, white pepper, star anise and chopped herb accent the fruity core of black cherry and crushed raspberry. Velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. Drink 2018–2027."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sandler,36.0,93.0,"Plump but sour cranberry fruit aromas meet with sweet sandalwood, clove and forest floor on the nose of this San Francisco-made bottling from the historic property. Sanguine touches on the palate lead to raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and juniper flavors, ending in a menthol finish."
Syrah-Viognier,US,California,Prospect 772,36.0,93.0,"A stunning Syrah with 4% Viognier that's almost black in color and aching with deep, dark cherry and black licorice surrounded by a lush, dense herb garden. This is a heavy, rich California Syrah, practically a velvet curtain, that will appeal to Rhône aficionados and anyone with a taste for something big, accentuated by a smoky finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Doyenne,36.0,93.0,"The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!"
Grenache Blanc,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Domaine Cazes,36.0,93.0,"This is a lush and satisfying Rivesaltes Ambré, made from 100% White Grenache and aged in oak for seven years. There's a gorgeous rancio quality to the wine with notes of almond and orange rind throughout, framed by aromas and flavors of quince paste, wood-grilled peach, fruit cake and carmelized date. The long finish shows good evolution, transitioning from notes of stone fruit to peach pit and finally ending on a sweet spice accent."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Villa S. Anna,36.0,93.0,"This shows floral and underbrush aromas of violet, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate offers ripe black cherry, red currant, Asian spice and toasted notes. It's structured yet elegant, with firm but fine tannins and nice depth. It's ready now, so enjoy soon."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,36.0,93.0,"Named after the barn owl (Tyto alba) that nests in the woods of the Lezirias estate, this has great tannins that give shape to the dense black fruits. With a powerful structure and so much of the Touriga Nacional perfumes, this is a wine for aging. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Melville,36.0,93.0,"Both a study of clone and stainless-steel processing, this wine offers fresh-cut pineapple, ripe Gala apple, honeydew and even peach, with a citrus-skin sharpness to the nose. The flavors are delicate and familiar but complex and deep, with Anjou pears, lemon-lime soda and apple flesh. It's a lively stainless expression."
Sangiovese,US,California,Cent'Anni,36.0,93.0,"With just 1% each of Cabernet and Merlot, this wine is darker in color, and offers pretty while dense aromas of concentrated violet, hot brick and boysenberry juice. It's dense and grippy on the palate, but quite lively with flavors of dried blackberry, pepper spice, black slate minerality and, on the finish, semisweet chocolate."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Thomas Fogarty,36.0,93.0,"This mountaintop winery puts much effort in single-vineyard expressions, but this blend rivals even those, with nose-tingling aromas of concentrated hibiscus and pomegranate, plus dried sour cherries and graphite. Prominent herbs like oregano, thyme and dried sage mix with eucalyptus and menthol on the palate, where soft cranberry fruit serves as backbone."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Josef Jamek,36.0,93.0,"Peach and bergamot, mirabelle plum and lemon zest, ripeness and freshness, amplitude and sleekness: whoever loves to trade in juxtapositions will love this expressive, irresistible wine. Etched with very clear contours it nonetheless delivers generous, gorgeous fruit."
Chardonnay,US,California,Timbre,36.0,93.0,"A warm and welcoming yet light dusting of vanilla lifts the Marcona almonds, honey, buttered toast and white peach on the nose of this bottling from the brand formerly known as La Fenetre. Cashew nuts pop on the palate alongside brown butter, lemon peels, salt and light caramel flavors, all in utter balance."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,36.0,93.0,"Sumptuous and hedonistic, this perfumed single-vineyard bottling shines a spotlight on luscious grapefruit, guava and pineapple flavors. It's decadently fruity, but crisp acidity and a delicate crushed-mineral undertone keep it fresh and invigorating."
Chardonnay,US,California,Zotovich Cellars,36.0,93.0,"Very focused Key-lime aromas meet with strongly earthy, wet-clay scents on the nose of this wine that also offers a subtle minty kick. The palate is citrus-driven, with kumquat and tangerine flavors that give way to a warmer cream element before settling on a tense pink-grapefruit pith element."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,36.0,93.0,"This 100% Touriga Nacional comes from the government-owned estate in the north of Tejo. Named after the barn owl that is found in the woods, the wine is structured with dense tannins as well as concentrated black fruits. It is balanced with its fruit and structure already working well together, but it will need time. Drink from 2019."
Riesling,US,California,Greenwood Ridge,36.0,93.0,"A warm amber color and intense, concentrated honey and toasted-nut aromas are followed by a supple, soft texture and mouthcoating flavors of sweet apricot and baked peaches. This will be fantastic as a dessert in itself, or with some less-sweet cookies or sautéed almonds."
Syrah,US,California,Kaleidos,36.0,93.0,"Richness is on full display in this bottling by Steve Martell, with baked black plum, vanilla, allspice and nearly a prune scent on the nose. Caramel flavors of blackened blackberry pie with vanilla ice cream make for a very full and undeniably delicious sip."
Zinfandel,US,California,Newsome-Harlow,36.0,93.0,"A consistent standout among Newsome-Harlow's stellar lineup of single-vineyard Zins, The Donner Party is rich in blackberry liqueur and licorice, finely structured and soft in tannins, with a dusty, mocha-lined finish and just the right seasoning of leather. Blended with 12% Petite Sirah."
Red Blend,US,California,Big Basin,36.0,93.0,"Coming from Monterey and Santa Cruz vineyards, this blend of 34% Grenache, 23% Syrah, 18% Mourvèdre, 21% Carignane and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon features notes of plum jam, sagebrush and root beer. It jumps off the palate with bright acidity and grippy tannins, delivering ripe berry fruit and chili pepper spices, enlivening more senses than just tastebuds."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta de Chocapalha,36.0,93.0,"There is a great, juicy feel to this otherwise serious and firm wine. Black fruit flavors push through the structure, offering richness as well as power. The acidity, layers of toast and an impressively fresh feel all come through strongly. It needs aging; drink from 2017."
Merlot,US,Washington,J. Bookwalter,36.0,93.0,"Supple and layered, this nicely captures the scope and scale of this superb vintage. It's still young, tight and quite compact, but shows threads of tobacco, anise, stone and pencil lead, along with full, fleshy, plum and cassis fruit. Great structure and dense, ripe tannins. This is a perfect illustration of why Washington Merlot can claim to be the best in the world outside of Pomerol."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Cooper-Garrod,36.0,93.0,"Alluringly seductive aromas of black cherry syrup, blueberry pie, blackberry preserves and fresh-cracked black pepper draw the nose into this blend of Lone Oak and Valley View vineyards, located 800 to 1,000 feet in elevation. Flavors of blackberry-chocolate liqueur, plums and black cherries are elevated by pine sap, rosemary and strong tannins that maintain perfect grip. Serve with lamb."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Zusslin,36.0,93.0,"Fresh yellow apple aromas broaden out into notes of ripe, baked apple. The palate is creamy and beautifully textured by autolysis and shows off rounded flavors of freshly baked shortcrust and pastry. The overall effect is one of poised freshness and harmonious balance. This is dry and taut but generous with ample substance that highlights both fruit and structure—all achieved without dosage and addition of sulfur dioxide."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,St. Innocent,36.0,93.0,"Biodynamically farmed Momtazi Vineyard is a favorite of several high-end Willamette Valley producers. Fresh cranberry and raspberry scents introduce a young wine still showing a blue shade around the rim. It's silky and sensuous, with blue plum, black cherry, dark chocolate and notes of earth and iron."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Domaine de la Bégude,36.0,93.0,"A structured and still young wine from the estate owned by the Tari family, formerly of Château Giscours in Margaux. It is packed with black fruits, spice and dense tannins that are melding together so well. Licorice and wood aging give the wine an extra complex dimension. Drink this from 2019."
Sangiovese,US,California,Cent'Anni,36.0,93.0,"Kudos to winemaker Doug Margerum for holding onto this extremely pleasing wine long enough for all the components to come together. Six years in, the aromas of cola, black cherry, rose petal, pepper dust and crushed gravel are still fresh and vibrant, while the palate remains upright due to structural tannins. Flavors of blackberry, raspberry and baking spice abound, making for an elegant wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Soos Creek,36.0,93.0,"This is the first reserve for this unassuming, low-profile winery whose wines clearly belong in the first rank of Washington's boutiques. It shows classic Cabernet fruit from three top vineyards, long and persistent, yet never over extracted or alcoholic. True Bordeaux style in an elegant, ageworthy wine. Editors' Choice."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Paul Blanck,36.0,93.0,"A lovely lemony lift jumps from the glass and immediately signals maturing Riesling. The palate is still taut with freshness but has the harmonious balminess of bottle age. Hints of dried pear and candied lemon peel appear. The palate is as precise and taut as ever, brightened by utter apple and citrus crispness. The finish is long, dry and utterly clean cut."
Red Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,36.0,93.0,"A slightly brooding nose suggests brambly fruit as well as freshness. The palate crunches with red and black cherry, imbued with a kind of boyish impish joy. This is disarmingly rustic, but also very, very unusual and utterly moreish in its singular and honest simplicity. Drying tannins coat the mouth while juicy tart freshness makes you want to take another sip. This is all about stormy, romantic wilderness. Beware, this might just steal your heart."
White Blend,US,California,Barden,36.0,93.0,"This blend of 35% Chardonnay, 35% Pinot Blanc and 30% Pinot Gris from La Encantada Vineyard is a stunner, starting with its crystalline brilliance in the glass. Lime blossom, pomelo, baking soda and lanolin aromas lead into a grippy palate of green apple, chalk and wet cement. Extremely tense and compelling."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Leeuwin Estate,36.0,93.0,"The Art Series' little brother is all grown up and ready to stand on its own as a terrific wine. Toasted hazelnuts accent bold pineapple and ripe citrus flavors in this full-bodied, slightly creamy bottling. It's complete and complex, with a long, zesty finish. Drink now–2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Aether Wine Company,36.0,93.0,"This is an excellent appellation blend, starting with a slightly sweet nose of concentrated grenadine, carnations and wild herbs. The sip dries up considerably, with lots of eucalyptus showing at first and then a strong candied raspberry flavor riding the herbs and a strong acidity. Strawberry arises into the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Boekenoogen,36.0,93.0,"This family-run vineyard and winery continues to excite, delivering delicious, broadly appealing aromas of caramelized yellow pears with a cinnamon-butter glaze, honey-laced pineapple and lemon soda. The creamy mouthfeel carries flavors of yellow cake, lemon custard and warm peach, yet candied grapefruit peel carves a sharp line down the middle."
Syrah,US,California,Margerum,36.0,93.0,"Ripe black cherries get aromatic lift from sagebrush and thyme on this wine that Doug Margerum makes from the fruit of his friend, Reo Reiswig. There is an immediate zing of acidity, with red and purple fruit flavors that bounce between raspberry and blueberry while also picking up mocha, herbs and leather along the way. A very dynamic wine."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Doyenne,36.0,93.0,"A compelling blend of 40% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 20% Syrah, this wine captures your attention from the first sniff. The aromas have a rare mix of fruit, soil, barrel and animal, the sort of complexity that eludes language. It fills the mouth with wild and arresting flavors, sweet cherry fruit, animal, loam, cut tobacco and coffee grounds, all folding into dense, dark tannins."
Malbec,US,Washington,Kontos,36.0,93.0,"Pure Malbec from one of Washington's best vineyards, this is power personified. Cassis and black cherry fruit is tightly wound around mineral-drenched tannins. There are telltale streaks of earth and stem, a dusting of ground coffee, and other nuances that show the varietal details often missing from domestic Malbec. A fine effort."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Anita und Hans,36.0,93.0,"Red cherry fruit spiced by gentle white pepper notes makes for an enjoyable, fresh and joyful red. This combines the virtues of fruity, cherry-ish Zweigelt with the more sumptuous, fuller-bodied and spicy notions of Blaufränkisch. If you are new to Austrian reds, this pretty much is exquisite Burgenland in a glass."
Chardonnay,US,California,Calera,36.0,93.0,"Josh Jensen's 40 years of experience result in an expert wine that subtly delivers a touch of everything needed, but nothing in excess. The nose boasts scorched peach flesh at the core with squeezed lime on the edges, and the palate offers apple skin, nectarine flesh and lime zest, with a faint display of the nuttiness that will emerge with time. Elegant and excellent."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,August Kesseler,36.0,93.0,"A musky, floral perfume melds with ripe white peach and a crush of stony mineral on this beautifully composed off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush, with juicy melon, peach and mango flavors, but balanced by a long, flinty finish. Drink now to maximize its ripe, perfumed exuberance."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Paul Blanck,36.0,93.0,"The nose is closed and gives a little lemon and chamomile lift. The palate is more expressive: concentrated lemon and mandarin zest play aromatically on a zesty, pure and very streamlined and dry palate. There is something incisive and intense about this. There also are glimpses of floral peachy edges that will only increase with age. This is ready now but has the stuffing to go the mileage: drink now through 2030."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lafon-Rochet,36.0,93.0,"Big-hearted fruit dominates this smooth wine. The estate, owned by the Tesseron family and close to their other property of Pontet-Canet, is performing well and it shows in this juicy ripe wine, full of generous tannins. The aftertaste shows both acidity and concentration. Drink from 2022."
Chardonnay,US,California,Pellet Estate,36.0,93.0,"From a beautiful site overlooking the Petaluma Gap, this wine opens in pretty honeysuckle aromas before unfurling clean, focused flavors of green-apple slices, lemon meringue and a touch of anise. Bright acidity is left to shine without the intrusion of oak, and yet the texture doesn't suffer, offering plenty of velvety smoothness."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ebner-Ebenauer,36.0,93.0,"Yeasty roundedness plays the leading role on the nose and palate. Amidst those rich leesy notes, hints of pepper and lemon appear and the overall impression is one of savory yeasty richness tempered by zesty freshness of lemon and grapefruit. This is full-on drama. Enjoy."
Chardonnay,US,California,Melville,36.0,93.0,"Tasted blind alongside the 2005 and 2010 vintages, this bottling, which is Chad Melville's first for his family winery after years focused on the vineyard, carries the same persistent sizzle of acidity on the front of the sip. But it's fresher on the nose, with pear juice, lychee and vanilla dust, and more approachable on the tropical palate, where jasmine, exotic banana, papaya, plumeria and a touch of guava shine."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carlisle,36.0,93.0,"Ripe and juicy in red and black berries, this wine has a big presence and plenty of bold flavor, retaining all the elements so beloved in the variety, from black pepper to leather and cigar, while displaying a deftness of winemaking skill in the cellar. Mouthfilling, it has zinging acidity on the finish, making for a memorable wine."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Pierre-Bise,36.0,93.0,"Already with a deep golden color, this single vineyard wine is richly honeyed and dense. It has a viscous texture, ripe with Seville orange marmalade and apricot fruits that are cut by the acidity that gives this wine its lift and its ageability. The wine is delicious now, but don't be too impatient: it will get better and better over many years. So drink from 2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lombardi,36.0,93.0,"Made in minuscule amounts, with fruit sourced from the Martinelli family's Charles Ranch, this is a fulsome, come-hither white. It's ripe in apple caramel and butterscotch, beautifully unctuous on the palate in all the right ways. Finding a balance beneath the generosity, it ends in crisp lemon and lime."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Graci,36.0,93.0,"Underbrush, menthol, new leather and black-skinned berry aromas emerge in the glass. The smooth, full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, baking spice, tobacco and mineral alongside firm, velvety tannins."
Pinot Noir,US,California,McIntyre Vineyards,36.0,93.0,"Featuring and named after a painting by renowned Santa Barbara artist James Jarvaise, this intriguing bottling shows Anjou pear, Key lime, green pluot, cider apple and strong sourdough notes on the nose. Those unique aromas carry to the palate, where a mix of yellow flowers, yellow melon, lemon blossom and lemon verbena soar across a flavor base of lightly buttered toast."
Viognier,US,California,Sanford,36.0,93.0,"Seductive aromas of caramel, fresh-crushed soda rock and squeezed lemon introduce this Viognier from a historic vineyard by winemaker Steve Fennel. The palate releases flavors steadily, from tight lime juice and citrus pith in the midpalate to round nectarine and ripe apple flesh on the edges."
Chardonnay,US,California,Diatom,36.0,93.0,"Freshly cut Anjou pear, crisp apple, hints of honeydew and lime skin show on the nose of this vibrant bottling by Greg Brewer. There is bouncy acidity and a fine-grained, chalky grip to the sip, delivering chilled green-melon and lime-sorbet flavors. It's tangy yet laced with stony minerality and intriguing texture."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Wait Cellars,36.0,93.0,"One of the producer's native-fermentation wines, this was given 25% whole-cluster fermentation and one-third new oak. The wine blends grapes from the Devoto Garden and Skikos vineyards, combining them into light, clear color with a twist of pine resin. Juicy in acidity, it offers complexity and balance."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,36.0,93.0,"Whiffs of wildflowers, fennel and slate combine in this deliciously blossomy, complex wine. While dry in style, it's a touch softer and riper than the HJW or Josef Vineyard bottlings, coating the palate in a supple silk of peach and grapefruit flavors. Powerful and concentrated, it lingers long on the finish. Delicious now, but sure to improve through at least 2023."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Brophy Clark,36.0,93.0,"Though an appellation blend, this bottling often comes from a single vineyard and is treated with great care, resulting in a complete package. That starts with baked red cherry, mulberry and tangy plum on the nose, dusted with nutmeg and hickory smoke. The intriguing flavor profile offers tangy black raspberry, suave hibiscus and other red-flower touches along with clove stick and cinnamon spice."
Zinfandel,US,California,Newsome-Harlow,36.0,93.0,"Winemaker Scott Klann combines with friend and fellow winemaker Marco Cappelli, the owner of Herbert Vineyard, to craft this celebration of elegant blackberry, jammy fruit, black pepper and licorice. Fine-tuned and elegant, it's also brawny, with substantial mouthfeel and texture."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin,36.0,93.0,"This shows a hint of mineral along with tropical fruit. This is a seductive combination that shows richness and a taut, nervy character. Age for at least six years."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sineann,36.0,93.0,"Focused, deep and rich, this lovely vineyard designate is dotted with notes of charcoal, caramel and mocha. It offers both power and finesse, a rare combination, with persistent flavors, anchored on a substantial core of raspberry and cherry fruit. Drink now through 2026."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,36.0,93.0,"Feathery, lifted notes of citrus, lemon zest and leaf announce a lightness of touch. Some topnotes of chamomile tisane swing alongside. The palate is fresh, taut, dry and light-footed. Deeper notions of fruit are still just hinted at, a core of fruit that still takes time before it is unlocked. Purity and elegance mark this one out."
Chardonnay,US,California,Leo Steen Wines,36.0,93.0,"This Chablis-esque bottling from Leo Hansen—the Danish, Healdsburg-based sommelier-turned-winemaker—offers Gravenstein apple, buttered toast and mandarin orange zest aromas. The palate is high-toned and brisk, with zesty citrus peel and grapefruit pith flavors and a prominent chalk-like minerality."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Valserrano,36.0,93.0,"Woody aromas of vanilla complement ripe black-fruit scents. This wine feels dry, comported, mildly tannic and nicely structured. Flavors of cherry and blackberry are accented by oaky notes of vanilla and toast, while hints of baking spices lurk around the edges. A dry, classy, well-oaked finish seals the deal on this excellent Rioja; drink from 2020–2028."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bailiwick,36.0,93.0,"This wine is from a blend of four vineyard sites, including the single-vineyard-designated Silver Pines, chilled by Petaluma Gap air. Clear and light in color, the wine is vibrant and earthy in dark cherry, clove and petulant Asian spice. The tannins are well integrated and soft, rounded in forest floor and toasted oak."
Grenache,US,California,Stephen Ross,36.0,93.0,"This is an attention-grabbing example of how compelling cool climate Grenache can be. Rosewater, fennel, black plum and loamy soil aromas grow more rosy as the wine opens. The palate is superdry, with chalky tannins and zesty acidity, revealing more floral flavors. An extremely elegant wine."
Grenache,US,California,Kokomo,36.0,93.0,"This producer is showing true skill with this variety, vibrant in red and black cherry and cassis. Bright and satisfyingly generous on the palate, it's succulent as well as being earthy, with lingering layers of black pepper and cinnamon. It never gets heavy or burdensome, maintaining a fleetness of freshness that's irresistible."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Larner,36.0,93.0,"A fresh array of boysenberry, black raspberry, white pepper, crushed violet and dried lavender show on the nose of this bottling by Michael Larner. It's a very lively wine on the sip, with more boysenberry and black pepper as well as crushed lilac character."
Red Blend,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Loma Larga,36.0,93.0,"Immediately this Syrah-led blend registers as something special. Ripe berry and herb aromas are spicy, fresh and textbook for Chile. A full, dense, chewy palate is potent but under control. Flavors of olive, spice, coffee, toast and dark fruits finish with barrel spice, a final wave of black-fruit flavor and notes of juniper and eucalyptus. Drink through 2021."
Rosé,US,California,Young Inglewood,36.0,93.0,"This is a truly delicious wine, worthy of accolades no matter its gulpability, made in a pretty off-pink color from 80% Malbec and 20% Merlot and aged six months in stainless steel. Tangy and crisp, it sings on the palate, an undeniable reward of watermelon and mandarin orange that's got meat on its tender bones."

Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Forstreiter,36.0,93.0,"This is intensely rich, with very concentrated ripe fruit. Apple and peach flavors are cut by acidity. A note of pepper details the finish. Age for 3–4 years."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,St. Innocent,36.0,93.0,"This biodynamically farmed vineyard is often found as a named designate, and for good reason. It's one of the Willamette Valley's most distinctive and evocative sites, with less of an emphasis on pure fruit flavors, and more attention to details such as herbal tea, earth, stone and dried leaf. The fruit is tart and lightly herbal, like a fresh-picked mountain berry."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,La Chablisienne,36.0,93.0,"Complex and rich, this is full of tangy fruits, with a dense structure that brings out weight, minerality and a chewy core of zesty citrus. It very crisp and fruity at this stage and needs to develop its many other flavors. Drink from 2017. This is a balanced, fruity wine with a beautiful line of fragrant acidity. Apples, pears and a touch of chewy tannin all work together well to give a wine that is both firmly textured and fresh with fruit. It could be drunk now, although it will be best from 2016."
Chardonnay,US,California,Artesa,35.0,93.0,"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Joseph Phelps,35.0,93.0,"This is a standout, showing Napa Valley's true potential for the variety. Steely and light bodied in approach, it offers a lively complement of apricot and juicy green-apple flavors, finishing on a fresh fig note and feeling balanced and complete."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Tejo,Fiuza,35.0,93.0,"Ikon refers to Touriga Nacional's position as Portugal's iconic grape. It is almost black in color, and profoundly dense and dry with wood tannins at this early stage of development. Yet it promises a palate that's rich and smooth with fruit in time. It's intended for long-term aging so drink from 2017."
Zierfandler,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,35.0,93.0,"Creamy notes of red and yellow apples, just an edge of citrus zestiness and inviting notions of apricot announce a subtle, elegant white with a dense but never heavy structure. Rounded fruit with a wonderfully linear trajectory make this a worthwhile food companion. This is a wonderful expression of the indigenous Austrian Zierfandler."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sequum,35.0,93.0,"A tiny-production wine that is exuberantly brambly and wild, this has a bouquet of juicy black and red berries at its core.

Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Castello di Neive,35.0,93.0,"This takes a few minutes to open up in the glass before revealing alluring classic Nebbiolo scents of wild red berry, sweet cake spice and a balsamic note.

Firm, glossy tannins and bright acidity give it an elegant structure."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Dion,35.0,93.0,"Four clones, aged in 50% new French oak, constitute the heart and soul of this outstanding reserve. Redolent with a fertile mix of moist earth, compost, tobacco and floral highlights, it fills the mouth with a rich and seamless mix of plums, baked cherries and barrel notes. It leaves a tantalizing trail of mocha, toasted hazelnuts and caramel as it winds dreamily through a lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Wrath,35.0,93.0,"A study of umami, this wine shows shiitake mushrooms, decomposing wood, soy and hibiscus on the nose. The palate is silky smooth yet with immediate verve, unfolding with flavors of loam, beef char, teriyaki-laced berries, smashed plums and graphite. It's focused yet expansive."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Giesen,35.0,93.0,"Thick, unctuous and impressive, this is one seriously sweet Sauvignon Blanc. Honey and bergamot notes mark the nose, while the palate features more citrus and folds in hints of pineapple as well. Long and sticky on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lynmar,35.0,93.0,"An impressive blend of different vineyard sites, given a touch less oak than many of the producer's single-vineyard selections, this wine doesn't skimp on flavor nor complexity. It weaves steely minerality into warmer layers of nutmeg, apple and preserved lemon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Cono Sur,35.0,93.0,"Dense, baked and mulled blackberry and cassis aromas include bold but classy oak notes. This feels seamless except for raring tough tannins, while flavors of toast, graphite and spiced blackberry finish smooth and chewy, with a sense of lushness despite lasting residual tannins. Drink through 2025."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,35.0,93.0,"Dark in color and deep in heavily ripened fruit flavors, this full-bodied, concentrated wine is a show-stopper. A quiet sense of power comes from the dried plum and raisin aromas and the rich blueberry, clove and dark-chocolate flavors. This is a keeper that will be best to drink after 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,35.0,93.0,"Named after the steep slopes that back the Bourgeois winery, this powerful, concentrated wine shows both wonderful white and yellow fruits and a mineral character that gives a superb tension. Packed with fruit and impressively textured, it can still age. Drink from 2017."
Syrah,US,California,Spicy Vines,35.0,93.0,"From Montemaggiore Vineyard on the western hills of the appellation, and containing 5% Viognier, this is a well-made wine, nicely rustic in a dirty, rowdy mix of black pepper and earth. Dense, thick layers of cocoa play with floral notes of lavender and rose, finishing softly. This will age well through 2023."
Chardonnay,US,California,Chanin,35.0,93.0,"Clean Asian pear, wet gravel and lime peel aromas show on the tightly wound nose of this bottling. The palate is quite delicate at first, offering lightly seared white peach, chalk and lime zest notes, but grows increasingly savory and delicious as it opens, indicating great cellar potential. Drink 2018–2030."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Domaine Eden,35.0,93.0,"This wine's wild raspberry, mace, composting violets, kola nut and musk hints make for a very pretty but extremely complex nose. Fermented with 30% whole clusters, it's energetic on the palate, with dark cranberry and sharp raspberry flavors enhanced by allspice and anise. It has a very long finish."
Red Blend,Austria,Carnuntum,Markowitsch,35.0,93.0,"Peppery berry fruit is the joyful, dominating factor here. Nose and palate simply burst with spicy fruit. There is some grippy tannin as a counterweight. Wonderful freshness against oaky vanilla provides a subtle, understated nuance. There is absolute elegance despite the exuberance."
Syrah,US,California,Pace,35.0,93.0,"Tarry, savory notes of dried beef, soy, charred lamb and underlying blackberry combine for a nose that screams umami. The palate carries a similar effect of grilled, lavender-covered lamb shank, black peppercorns and black sesame."
Syrah,US,California,Beauregard,35.0,93.0,"Concentrate rose petals, crisp raspberries, and a rocky, black gravel—not quite as pungent as asphalt—pervades the nose on this wine from an extremely coastal, 13-acre vineyard planted in 1988. Flavors of freshly picked blackberry mesh with lots of fennel, licorice and anise-seed spice."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,La Chablisienne,35.0,93.0,"This refreshing wine comes from one of the Premier Cru sites on the north-facing bank of the Serein river. It's structured, tight and full of fine acidity and grapefruit and crisp apple flavors. Its texture and mineral character will allow it to age. Drink from 2019."
Albariño,US,California,Marimar Estate,35.0,93.0,"A longstanding estate wine inspired by the producer's Spanish heritage, this shows bright, measured acidity and stainless-steel fermentation, remaining fresh and fleshy in the glass in its offerings of green apple, lime and peach. Thirst-quenching, the fruit flavors are complemented by floral notes of jasmine."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rosenblum,35.0,93.0,"A classic of the genre, this combines a deep color with luscious fruit character and spicy accents on a velvety texture. Firm tannins lend an appetizing grip, while the fresh ripe blackberry, clove and cedar flavors seem to melt on the tongue and linger on the finish. It shows great complexity and balance in a traditional dry style."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lincourt,35.0,93.0,"Named after Bill Foley's jingle-writing mother , this wine sings, starting with the starry shine in the glass. Aromas of light salmon brittle turn to apple blossoms, and then a sip reveals sea salt, lemon rind and poached apple, with a nutty macadamia paste note throughout."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Manzoni,35.0,93.0,"Deeply funky aromas of salted rhubarb and beets, grilled meats, anise and hot tar greet the nose on this fascinating Pinot Noir. Sanguine, bloody flavors evolve down a line of licorice and slate toward raspberry, with a bit of grilled meat at the very end."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre,35.0,93.0,"Rich and dense, this is full of ripe apple and lemon juice flavors. It's supercharged with acidity that shoots right through the fruitiness and gives a tight, crisp character. Delicious now, but it will be better in 2016."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Boudreaux Cellars,35.0,93.0,"This is remarkable, with modest alcohol and a concentrated, ageworthy structure. Lime and pineapple flavors are enhanced with lively, gin-like botanicals. There is vivid acidity and a lick of butterscotch on the finish."
Fiano,Italy,Southern Italy,Villa Raiano,35.0,93.0,"This opens with subtle aromas of wild flower and a whiff of exotic fruit. The bright fruity palate offers white peach, apple and a hint of honeydew melon. It's straightforward and refreshing."
Merlot,US,California,Gundlach Bundschu,35.0,93.0,"This stellar, gracefully understated Merlot is bolstered by small additions of four other red Bordeaux varieties. It opens with a fresh tropical note that's unexpectedly bright and slowly unwinds to reveal threads of plum, cinnamon, mocha and espresso bean flavor."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Syncline,35.0,93.0,"This 100% varietal wine delivers mineral, citrus twist, raw meat, raspberry and black pepper notes. The palate is full bodied and packed to the brim with fruit and savory flavors. It brings a seamlessness and length that are absolutely dazzling."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Gorman,35.0,93.0,"Big, round and lush, this is the fourth vintage for this wine, one of the best Chardonnays in Washington state. In this vintage it did not go through full malolactic, leaving a nice underlying acidity with a leesy, creamy freshness. Golden apples, stone fruits and a lick of butterscotch add to the luscious, generous finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Emmerich Knoll,35.0,93.0,"A beautiful combination of ripe, tropical fruits with flint, honey and smoke. There is a great steely backbone here, offering a linear character as well as elegant, ageworthy fruit."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,35.0,93.0,"Honeysuckle wafts softly amidst white peach and lemon aromas on this dry, unctuous wine. Richly textured, it's almost oily in mouthfeel, but balanced by a streak of high acidity and a steely, mineral tone. Finishes long and lean on a bristling lime-zest note."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Nittardi,35.0,93.0,"This opulent Chianti Classico opens with aromas of violets, black berries, meat juices and spice. The delicious palate delivers concentrated black cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, clove and balsamic herbs. It's soft and round but at the same time it boasts alluring intensity."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Seal Beach,35.0,93.0,"There's been lots to like from this SoCal winery, and this bottling adds to the list. Rusty in color, it offers cranberry, strawberry, sagebrush and iron aromas. The palate pops with zesty pomegranate fruit, lifted by herbal garrigue notes and spice."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,35.0,93.0,"This dark, almost black-colored blend combines Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Syrah. They all come together in a rich, powerful palate full of explosive black fruit and fine, focused acidity. The structure shows that the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2020."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Helwig,35.0,93.0,"Very impressive color, fruit concentration and tannic structure add up to an outstanding Petite Sirah. What's compelling is that this full-bodied wine seems to get its character purely from the concentrated and tannin-laden grapes rather than from new oak barrels or add-ins. This needs time in a cool cellar to show all its potential complexity. Best from 2016–2022."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Picque Caillou,35.0,93.0,"Produced with advice from the late Denis Dubourdieu who was instrumental in revolutionizing Bordeaux white wines, this is impressive. The wood aging is just right, giving toast and allowing the ripe fruits to blossom and smooth out. The wine will age well, so don't drink before 2020."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Edmeades,35.0,93.0,"Unusually graceful and elegant despite full body and dense tannins, this wine has lush, rich fruit flavors like blackberry compote, plus clove and black pepper accents. It's an outstanding example of how attractive the variety can be, and no surprise considering its long history in Mendocino County."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Quilceda Creek,35.0,93.0,"You have to love the '07 vintage. This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mélange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice. But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantial—cherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Le Crock,35.0,93.0,"Owned by the Cuveliers who also own Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien, Le Crock in 2012 is a powerhouse of ripe tannins and juicy acidity. It's a wine that demands aging with its tannins and still-youthful fruitiness. Drink from 2019."
Moscatel,Spain,Spain Other,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega,35.0,93.0,"Orange peel, nutmeg and burnt brown-sugar aromas set this sweet Moscatel apart from the masses. Round and creamy but still elegant on the palate, this blends flavors of honey, cinnamon, orange and apricot into a fine whole. A long, integrated finish with honey and caramel flavors is ideal. Drink through 2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Domaine Eden,35.0,93.0,"This bottling includes 14% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec. Sharp blackberry, smoky cedar and slightly green tomato-leaf aromas give way to a medium-bodied palate that's complex, with flavors of crushed oregano, dill, thyme and marjoram, all surrounding a smoky, juicy blackberry core."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Altocedro,35.0,93.0,"Intensely dark in color, this syrupy rich, extracted Malbec pushes the envelope of max ripeness via heady balsamic aromas of leather, blackberry and cassis. The palate couldn't be much riper, while heavy oak means flavors of chocolate, vanilla and wood grain are as prominent as the wine's massive berry fruit components. Drink through 2020."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Januik,35.0,93.0,"An elegant, supple, toasty, very tasty Cabernet Franc from one of the oldest vineyards on the Wahluke Slope. Winemaker Mike Januik carefully sculpts his flavors, running threads of black cherry, baking chocolate, espresso, loam, sandalwood, caramel and coconut through the core of this exceptional wine. Drink young or cellar and let it evolve—it's a winner either way."
Syrah,US,Washington,K Vintners,35.0,93.0,"This opens with beautiful dark fruit that's thick and voluptuous, tasting of black cherry and cassis, with excellent depth and intensity. It's sleek and supple, yet at the same time deep and polished, with impressive minerality and a note of granite-like rock."
Syrah,US,California,MacLaren,35.0,93.0,"Winemaker Steve Law hails from Scotland and honors his heritage with a nod to his “thirsty neighbors,” who will only gain further thirst after enjoying this Syrah. Pure to Law's cool-climate winemaking sensibilities, this offers a leathery tribute to peppery spice and bright fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,California,Brander,35.0,93.0,"Brander's annual Bordeaux blend features 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. There is ripe boysenberry, cedar and worn leather on the nose, followed by Bing cherry flavors on the palate, where acidity and a light body combine for a lively finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,S.A. Prüm,35.0,93.0,"Deep veins of citrus—white grapefruit, lemon and lime—pulsate through this vibrant, spine-tingling Riesling. It's delicately framed, glazed by a sheen of honey and hibiscus nectar, yet remarkably complex, touched by pollen and dusty mineral tones. Juicy and thirst quenching yet deeply satisfying."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,S.A. Prüm,35.0,93.0,"While gossamer-light in texture, this intensely sun-kissed spätlese builds in fruity, floral exuberance. Tropical mango and melon flavors are almost ruddy in richness but offset by an electric jolt of acidity. The finish is long and persistent, marked by tea leaves and lavender. Drink now through 2020."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Ancient Peaks,35.0,93.0,"This wine delivers aromas of molten-lava chocolate cake with black cherry syrup and a mint leaf on top. The palate shows bacon fat, blackberry extract, dark chocolate and freshly ground espresso, with a peppery roast-beef crust on the finish. It's a touch hot, but the wondrous flavors are worth it."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,35.0,93.0,"Classic Dão tannins—firm, dry and powerful—are supported by satisfyingly ripe black fruit to yield a concentrated, dense, perfumed wine. Swathes of fruit are layered with this solid structure and given a final lift by ample acidity. It still needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Betwixt,35.0,93.0,"Subtle, intricate aromas and equally sophisticated flavors of baking spices, tamarind and cherries make this a fascinating wine to taste. It's full bodied but lithe. Energizing acidity and firm tannins give it great structure and help carry the complex flavors through a lingering finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,35.0,93.0,"This is pure Riesling, very mineral, steely and direct. With intense acidity as well as the crispest green and citrus fruits, it's still very young. The fresh current gives an initial lift while keeping the concentrated texture in mind. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sokol Blosser,35.0,93.0,"This particular block was first planted in 2007, so these are young vines. Sometimes fruit from young vines will burst forth in spectacular fashion, and that's the case here. Supremely aromatic, this opens with a velvety mix of Asian spices, fruit leather, plum, cherry, cocoa powder and coffee grounds. All this and more can be tasted as well as sniffed, with excellent penetration through a lingering, cedary finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Grâce Dieu,35.0,93.0,"This is a deliciously balanced wine. Spice from the wood aging makes a happy contrast with the black-currant fruit and acidity. It is elegant and with great fruitiness. The wine, with its tannic base, will age well. The estate is to the west of Saint-Emilion, close to Château Figeac. Drink from 2023."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,35.0,93.0,"There is the merest hint of chamomile lift on the nose, pulling all the other flavors heavenwards with it. There is apple as well as lemon zest. The palate is wonderfully pure and totally dry. Here and there more herbal inflections show and more mellow hints of baked apple. This is dry, taut and aromatic, but also clean-cut and precise. Lovely now but with definite aging potential. Drink now through 2030."
Chardonnay,US,California,Presqu'ile,35.0,93.0,"This begins with round, lush scents of honey butter on hot toast and roasted almond. The initial flavors are light and fresh, with peach and slight guava. That tropicality emerges even more thoughout the long, lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Weatherborne,35.0,93.0,"Brewer Cris Carter, who works at Golden Road Brewery in Los Angeles, also makes stunning wines, in this case from John Sebastian Vineyard, showing a lush cherry-vanilla nose that's tightened with iron, iodine and earth. It's soft on the palate, with violet and rose petal florals and plum-skin tartness in the midpalate."
Chardonnay,US,California,Chappellet,35.0,93.0,"Grapes for this wine are sourced from a wide selection of sites, from Poe Vineyard in Carneros to Bald Mountain Vineyard on Mount Veeder. Together they sing harmoniously, offering a lightness of color and plenty of perfume around a rich body marked in toffee and supportive oak."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tranche,35.0,93.0,"The first Syrah in an expanding lineup of Tranche estate wines from the Blue Mountain Vineyard, this exceptional effort hews to a European style despite its substantial alcohol. Initially dark and smoky, hinting at streaks of herb and showing compact berry fruit flavors, it broadens out and expands aromatically, weaving in highlights of cured meats, bacon and clean earth. Just a dollop of herb and stem adds further interest, in a wine that retains its elegance along with exceptional power."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Oregon,Ellanelle,35.0,93.0,"The blend includes 4% each Cabernet Franc and Merlot. It was aged in 80% new oak, but retains its lovely, sweetly floral nose and luscious, berry fruit flavors. Yes, there is plenty of toasty oak goodness, but it's layered in with the fruit and soil flavors. Overall, this is a thoroughly enjoyable bottle right now, with a good decade or more of aging potential."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Elizabeth Chambers,35.0,93.0,"The winery's multiple vineyard designates are very good, but the blending that goes into this Winemaker's Cuvée puts it right there with the best of them. Bursting with blueberry, cherry and plum scents and flavors, this complex and complete wine piles on the details. A streak of chocolate here, a dash of cumin there, and on it goes."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lucas & Lewellen,35.0,93.0,"Juicy strawberries, raspberries and plums are balanced by wet slate on the nose of this wine from grape growing pioneer Louis Lucas and his vintner-partner, Judge Royce Lewellen. The palate shows more raspberry and a bit of boysenberry along with an orange rind tartness and woody herbs like juniper and black sage."
Syrah,New Zealand,Waiheke Island,Man O' War,35.0,93.0,"Representing a new level of quality for Waiheke Syrah, this wine boasts captivating aromas of peppered meat, violets and cassis. It's full bodied without being heavy, and the flavors seamlessly blend fruity with savory for a thrilling ride. Finishes long, with firm tannins and a hint of espresso. Drink now¬–2018."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Bergström,35.0,93.0,"This cuvée, says winemaker Josh Bergström, is crafted to compete with village Burgundies. Principally Temperance Hill fruit, it more than does the job, with great mouthfeel, and a succulent tangy ripe mix of citrus and stone fruits. There's a lick of caramel apple coming through also, and the wine is bursting with bright flavors across the board."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Luis Felipe Edwards,35.0,93.0,"This Syrah and Carmenère blend is bold but elegant, with ripe, spicy, bullish aromas that tell of what's to come. That would be a muscle-ripped palate with depth. Blackberry, black cherry, spice and blackened toast flavors finish in smoky darkness, with toasty length. This is a serious wine for red meats. Drink through 2025."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Picque Caillou,35.0,93.0,"The estate is within the urban area of Bordeaux, an oasis of green in the busy city. It is a smooth, rich wine that has benefited from the consultancy work of the late Denis Dubourdieu. Ripe tannins and fine acidity support the black currant and plum fruits. The wine is developing well. Drink from 2020."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Cave du Roi Dagobert,35.0,93.0,"Very pure and totally appetizing notes of ripe pear and juicy Golden Delicious Apple fill the nose. The same insistent lively fruitiness pervades the taut, dry and very juicy palate alongside a blazing vein of lemon freshness. This is full of fruit, life and freshness. The finish has a lifted touch of conifer and is totally refreshing and whistle clean."
Chardonnay,US,California,Center of Effort,35.0,93.0,"Though golden-hued in the glass, this is rather mellow on the nose, with soft lemon cream, toasted apple and marzipan aromas. The palate shows intense acidic energy, with zippy, tight and clean nectarine sorbet and Meyer lemon rind flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Au Bon Climat,35.0,93.0,"Candied lemon peel, Asian pear and marzipan hints show on the slightly oxidative nose of this bottling from Jim Clendenen. Ripe apple and pear flavors mark the palate, along with a warm toast component, but a Meyer lemon tang and bitter orange accents cut the richness."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Au Bon Climat,35.0,93.0,"A blend from Jim Clendenen's own Le Bon Climat Vineyard and the Bien Nacido Vineyard where his winery is located, this bottling shows candied red cherry, star anise, fennel and sagebrush on the earthy but fruity nose. The palate combines fresh thyme and other wild herbs with tart Montmorency cherry—bold flavors wrapped in a delicate package."
Pinot Noir,France,Loire Valley,Daniel Chotard,35.0,93.0,"A selection of old vines and 12 months of barrel aging have produced a ripe, full and spicy wine. Red-plum and black-cherry fruits are concentrated and dense with flavors of dark chocolate from the wood aging. Drink this powerful wine from 2019."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Tapiz,35.0,93.0,"Tapiz's best wine to date, and the first one to shoot higher than the basic or reserve level. Aromas of fresh balsam wood, ripe blackberry and cola are clean and deep. Feels just right, with rich, rewarding flavors of molten berry, chocolate and coffee. Finishes warm, toasty and with focus. Has it all; drink now through 2015."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Colombera & Garella,35.0,93.0,"A savory blend of 95% Nebbiolo and 5% Vespolina, this opens with lovely scents of fragrant purple flower, tilled soil, woodland berry, dark spice, new leather and a whiff of chopped herb. The polished palate offers mouthwatering black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and star anise framed in firm, elegant tannins. Drink 2017–2024."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Zusslin,35.0,93.0,"The faintest note of caramel precedes hints of baked red apples. This is soft and generous, mellow and smooth, supported by very fine mousse and pervaded by subtle freshness. All the structure and richness of Pinot Noir are evident in this elegant rosé. Its purity and poise is outstanding, its flavors linger and last. This is immensely rich yet slender: clearly the art of zero-dosage has been mastered here completely."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Filhot,35.0,93.0,"This wine is already balanced, rich and structured. Acidity, honey and yellow fruits are well integrated. At the same time, aging potential is there with the dry core, firm texture and the strong final acidity. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Flying Trout,35.0,93.0,"This blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon delivers notes of savory herbs, vanilla, cocoa and dark plum surrounded by a salty brine. The cranberry and blackberry flavors exhibit depth, elegance and purity, with a mesmerizing mouthfeel that leads to a hyper-extended, fruit-filled finish."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Molino di Sant'Antimo,35.0,93.0,"Earthy aromas of game, leather, tilled soil and eucalyptus lead the nose. The concentrated palate shows some muscle, delivering ripe wild cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha, licorice and tobacco along with assertive but fine-grained tannins. Hold for complexity. Drink 2018–2028."
Chardonnay,US,California,Wild Horse,35.0,93.0,"Reticent aromas of lemon peel, honeysuckle, meringue, tangerine, sea salt and chalk show on the nose of this top-end white from one of the region's pioneering properties. Rounded pear and apple show on the palate, but it's chalky and restrained, with a vein of grapefruit peel and lime pith."
G-S-M,US,California,Zenaida Cellars,35.0,93.0,"Pretty red fruit leads the nose on this blend of 50% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre, along with brown spices, anise and chopped herbs. The forest flavors are strong, with pine sap and eucalyptus, as riper boysenberry fruit emerges with chopped oregano and thyme."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,La Chablisienne,35.0,93.0,"This is a rich wine with a warm character. It comes from vines in the heart of Chablis, facing the Grand Cru vineyards on the opposite side of the river. It's full bodied and ripe, with plenty of acidity to partner its yellow fruit. Drink from 2019."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Syncline,35.0,93.0,"This blend is concentrated and meaty. It perfectly captures and combines the raspberry intensity of the Grenache, the brambleberry fruit of the Mourvèdre and the peppery smoke and spice of the Syrah. Somehow winemaker James Mantone coaxes something akin to French garrigue out of the grapes as well, making this one of a handful of Washington Rhônes that really capture those elusive French herbal highlights."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Baer,35.0,93.0,"A five-grape Bordeaux blend dominated by Merlot and Cab Franc, this is a deft mix of grapes nicely melded into a complete and satisfying wine. It's anchored by black cherry and cassis fruit, supple and focused. Surrounding that core fruit are layers of smoke, black olive, pencil lead and coffee grounds. It resonates gracefully through a long finish."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Amirault,35.0,93.0,"This perfumed and floral wine is concentrated and dense. Its ripe black-plum and spice flavors are impressive with their intensity. Produced from biodynamically grown grapes, the wine is showing considerable aging potential. Drink this wine from 2020."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey,35.0,93.0,"A mellow touch of ripe Red Delicious apple hovers on the nose. The palate brims with rich fruit, showing candied pear and dried apple. This richness is countered by a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge and a pure streak of fresh zestiness. A touch of sandalwood and cinnamon adds spice around the edges. While this is attractive now, it will reward cellaring as far more interesting notes of spice and fruit are sure to develop. Drink 2020–2030."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Nada Giuseppe,35.0,93.0,"Aromas of perfumed berry, scorched earth, grilled herb and dried rose petal waft out of the glass. The chewy palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice, ground pepper and clove alongside a solid backbone of velvety tannins. Tobacco and mocha notes close the finish. American Northwest Distributors Inc. and Vintage '59 Imports."
Red Blend,US,Oregon,W.T. Vintners,35.0,93.0,"Grenache (53%) takes the lead on this Rocks District wine followed by Syrah (37%) and Mourvèdre. The use of stems is apparent with aromas of cooked asparagus and green olives followed by earth, smoke, herbs, mineral and cherry. The flavors are rich, focused and mesmerizing, with a velvety feel and a hyperextended, savory finish. It has a distinctive, love it or hate it style."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Roger & Christophe Moreux,35.0,93.0,"This is a tropical-fruit-flavored wine with only a hint of more herbal flavors. It is ripe and juicy with sweeping fruitiness as well as acidity. The texture, mineral in character, comes from the chalk of the vineyard—one of the top sites in Sancerre. Drink this beautiful wine from 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Paetra,35.0,93.0,"The cuvée name Elwetritsche refers to a mythical beast from a town in the Pfalz region of Germany. Totally dry and stainless steel-fermented, it's dominated by citrus rind flavors, with traces of herb and minerality. With its exceptional texture that owes to 24 hours on the skins, it persists long into the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Au Bon Climat,35.0,93.0,"The slightly oxidized nose on this wine, which is sourced from the K Block at Bien Nacido Vineyard and Jim Clendenen's own Le Bon Climat Vineyard, shows seared marshmallow, hot Marcona almonds and honey, with a noticeable alkalinity. The browned-butter palate is cut by a lemon peel zing that evolves into truffle salt and roasted nuts. All elements linger deep into the finish."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,35.0,93.0,"Made from old plantings of Touriga Nacional in the Alentejo, this is a structured wine. Perfumed and juicy, it's rich in dark fruits and powerful tannins. Like any great wine from this grape, it's ready for aging, still densely textured and immense. Drink from 2018."
Fiano,Italy,Southern Italy,Villa Raiano,35.0,93.0,"Aromas of green pear, yellow apple and sage accompany a smoky whiff of flint stone. The structured, vibrant palate delivers a wonderful depth of flavors, including mature apple, white peach, orange zest, grilled rosemary and energizing mineral. It's impeccably balanced, with bright acidity."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Pascal Bouchard,35.0,93.0,"Crisp and edgy, this is a ripe while crisp and cool wine. With bright acidity and tangy lemon zest, it's a still young and full of citrus fruits. The mineral, taut texture promises some good aging. Drink from 2017."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Schoffit,35.0,93.0,"A medicinal lift precedes any notion of fruit on the nose which only hints at juicy ripe peach. The palate has the full hit of fruit with lovely quinine and peach pit bitterness thrown in as a counterbalance to the luscious, concentrated and powerful sweetness. With time, hints of lemony barley sugar and toffee come through. This is full-on and intense with incredible sweetness and length. The flavor just lasts and lasts with a stony warm persistence."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine de la Tour Blanche,35.0,93.0,"Wonderfully lively notes of fresh aromatic orange and citrus zest mingle together. The palate is bright and tight, fresh and concentrated. The body is slender and energetic, precise and fresh and has a lovely translucent quality with a beautifully clean finish. Drink now through 2025."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,35.0,93.0,"This vineyard, just behind the Bourgeois winery, has the steepest slope in Sancerre. With a brilliant exposure to the sun it is capable of producing totally ripe rich wines. This example, packed with mango and apricot flavors, is far removed from an herbal character. Instead, it is exotic, ripe and likely to be ready to drink from 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Seven Hills,35.0,93.0,"A streak of iron and mineral leads, with rich, ripe, dark fruit flavors following. Compact and tannic, this is extremely young. But compressed in the wine are complex streaks of herb and mineral. The tannins are strong and polished."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Reasons,35.0,93.0,"A mix of small lot-fermented, Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon, some from Champoux, it's fine-tuned, varietal, loaded with cassis and plum, light toast, and ground coffee. Elegant, proportionate, and a fine expression of a great vintage."
Pinot Noir,US,California,J. Lohr,35.0,93.0,"This savory Pinot Noir features aromas of blistered tomatoes, Italian herbs, Dr. Pepper and strawberries stewed with anise. Oregano and rosemary give herbal backbone to the pomegranate fruit flavors, all culminating in a very sanguine finish."
Merlot,US,Washington,Seven Hills,35.0,93.0,"Entirely estate-grown, 100% Merlot from old vines, this unfined wine is labeled vegan. Plush, briary, brambly fruit from the 30 year old vineyard brings an extra dimension to the wine, which shows a lovely balance of cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and baking spice flavors. There's a hint of pastry crust in the finish, which is seamless and long. An absolute delight."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Chambert,35.0,93.0,"A very rich wine, spicy and complex. Dark fruits, rich tannins and layers of berries, exuding power and density. There is a sense of fine tannin as well, suspended in the texture of the wine. Firm and solid and with a great aging potential. Drink from 2019."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Maurice Schoech & Fils,35.0,93.0,"Beautifully pure notes of crisp Cox's Orange Pippin apples shine on the nose. The palate is equally tart and wonderfully refreshing. This is a high-wire act of freshness and stony depth. You think you can almost taste the stone underneath all of these beautifully expressed apple notes that are pervaded by zesty freshness. What an invigorating, lip-smacking finish. This is lovely now but will develop. Drink now through 2030."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Léon Boesch,35.0,93.0,"Concentrated and full, this has serious structure, dense, dry spiciness as well as rich lychee and mango fruit flavors. The minerality brings out the chalk soil of the Zinnkoepflé vineyard, the highest in Alsace. It's a wine for aging, so don't drink before 2018."
Malbec,US,Washington,àMaurice,35.0,93.0,"A rush of blueberry introduces this exceptional Malbec. Pure and deep, it is streaked with bark, iron, clove and dark chocolate. Impressively long and focused, this has the structure and balance to develop further in the bottle. But as a young wine, it is already delicious and utterly seductive."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,35.0,93.0,"A structured, dense and concentrated wine, this has richness both in tannins and in fruit. It is a fine, rich, opulent wine that has weight as well as elegance. Delicate acidity cuts through the dark texture, sustained by berry fruits. Produced from old vines, the wine will age well. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,S.A. Prüm,35.0,93.0,"Savory touches of saffron and bee pollen lend complexity to this lithe, dancing spätlese. It's intensely sunny in character, bursting of honey and sweet tangerine flavors, yet held firm and tight by a backbone of reverberating lemon acidity. Drink now through 2021."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Mauro Sebaste,35.0,93.0,"Tilled soil, lead pencil, thyme, iris and wild berry aromas take center stage on this fragrant red. It's vibrant and young, with crushed strawberry, red raspberry cinnamon and white pepper flavors framed in lively acidity and taut youthfully austere tannins. A licorice note closes the finish. Drink 2023–2033."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Geyerhof,35.0,93.0,"A complex nose unites freshly cut russet-pear peel, ripe red apple and juicy, yellow Mirabelle plum, with a spicy touch of pepper. The palate shows oodles of that juicy Mirabelle, framed with tangy ripe lemon and bright tangerine. All this comes in a streamlined, concentrated but sleek shape with briskness and dryness. The long finish tingles with zesty spice."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Castello San Donato in Perano,35.0,93.0,"Underbrush, leather, tilled soil and game aromas lead the nose on this delicious, structured wine. The big, warm palate delivers juicy black cherry, carob, mocha and cinnamon alongside big, velvety tannins. This is aging well with nice depth, but it's in its ideal drinking window. Enjoy now through 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Prim Family,35.0,93.0,"Rich fruit meets hearty earth on this bottling, with aromas of baked cranberry, candied cherry and pomegranate alongside juniper, forest floor and ginger snap. The fresh berry and pomegranate juice-led palate is enhanced by cinnamon and clove, touched by dried orange-rind bitterness."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Anzivino,35.0,93.0,"Enticing scents of perfumed berry, violet, dried herb and cake spice take center stage along with a balsamic note. The palate is firmly structured but elegant, offering tart red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and licorice. It's well balanced and young with taut polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2018–2030."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Retro,35.0,93.0,"This 100% varietal wine is grown in Pope Valley on the eastern edge of the valley. Asian five-spice, strawberry and raspberry meld together seamlessly as a grip of tannin persists alongside a side note of oak. Ripe and rich, it has a pretty nose of bay and mocha, finishing smoothly etched in supportive, subtle acidity."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Borgo Scopeto,35.0,93.0,"This nuovo mondo Super Tuscan represents the first vintage of Borgo Scopeto under the management of Tenuta Caparzo, and it has a tremendous jammy, extracted quality to it, from the smooth, deep plum and blackberry nose to the soft, rich palate that exudes tons of black cherry fruit along with coffee and licorice. It's a mix of 60% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah, and everything is working in unison."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Borgo Scopeto,35.0,93.0,"The label reads Chianti, but this is more about deep, driving black fruit than typically racy Sangiovese. It kicks off with the purest scent of smashed berries, and then offers up a supercharged black-cherry-laden palate with far more hedonistic weight than starching acids. The wine finishes with power and warmth."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,Re Manfredi,35.0,93.0,"Aromas of mature plum, leather, pressed violet, dried herb and a whiff of Asian spice unfold on this full-bodied red. The warm, chewy palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, vanilla, licorice and tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,35.0,93.0,"A tender but perfumed hint of honeysuckle appears first on the nose, followed by rich peach hints. These notions persist on the palate where the peach and ripe yellow-plum notes are boosted by residual sweetness and countered by phenolic, slightly zesty but pleasant bitterness. You can feel the warmth on the medium-sweet finish. This is full on and rich, almost unctuous—perfect for blue cheeses."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Latour-Martillac,35.0,93.0,"This wine is all herbal fruits, with spice from the wood-aging and lively acidity. It has considerable potential, full of its nervy texture, minerality and tight acidity. Wait at least into 2020. Tristan and Loïc Kressmann now run the family estate."
Red Blend,Austria,Südburgenland,Jalits,35.0,93.0,"Tar and smoke add a note of intrigue to dark, dense plum, blueberry and black cherry fruit. Everything is still held back, still taut, still tightly coiled. There is fine structure and smoky-tinged spice. Medium-bodied midpalate weight is countered by freshness and an elegant structure, what echoes is spiced blueberry. A very classy bottle indeed."
Syrah,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Esporão,35.0,93.0,"Even the stain on the base of the cork reveals this wine's huge color. With its open richness and structure, it's comparable to a Rhône wine. Wood aging has lended notes of spice to go with the flavors of plum jelly and ripe, sweet fruit."
Pinot Noir,US,California,O'Connor,35.0,93.0,"A small-production wine from longtime growers, this is light and herbal, integrated in wood and tannin. It's vibrant and fresh on the palate and nose in plum and wild strawberry. High in gentle acidity, it provides a note of black tea and earthy truffle on the finish. Drink now through 2021."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Huët,35.0,93.0,"A tightly delineated wine, ripe, but with a great swathe of tangy balancing acidity. The structure shows the immense possibility of aging in a wine that is not yet getting into its stride."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Weatherborne,35.0,93.0,"Sultry aromas of dark berries and crushed violets show on the nose of this bottling alongside black sage, clove and fine-grained graphite aromas. Dark pomegranate and cranberry arise on the sip, lifted by white pepper and allspice."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Franck Millet,35.0,93.0,"Grown on dense chalky soil, this concentrated, tight and mineral wine is also rich. Pure acidity and rich apple flavors are cut by a nervy streak and textured with lively spice. This wine is worth aging, so drink from late 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,35.0,93.0,"The Herdade da Boavista vineyard has produced a serious powerful wine. It has dark tarry tannins with concentrated black fruits and a dense structure. It is big and solid in all senses, while still keeping a surprising amount of elegance with its fresh fruits and juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
White Blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Weingut Christ,35.0,93.0,"Mellow, ripe Comice pear on the nose leads into a soft, expressive yet light-bodied palate that has slight spritz, subtle, pear-scented flavors and a mellowing earthiness surrounded by overtones of dandelion and jasmine. At the center there is acidic verve. This is very elegant and very balanced."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Stoller,35.0,93.0,"Crafted from estate-grown Dijon clones, this outstanding effort offers sophisticated flavors of pear, quince, ginger and lemon curd, wrapped together in a buttered-nut finish. Barrel fermentation helps smooth the way into a beautifully balanced, ageworthy style."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Pietradolce,35.0,93.0,"Made with 70 and 80-year-old Nerello Mascalese vines planted at high altitude, this opens with delicate but enticing scents of leather, menthol, iris, red berry and thyme. The elegantly structured palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry, mocha, cinnamon and licorice. Polished tannins, bright acidity and a mineral vein provide the framework."
Syrah,US,California,Holus Bolus,35.0,93.0,"One of the few Syrahs from this cool-climate vineyard on the appellation's western edge, this bottling is an expert take on savory, with black and white papper, crushed rosemary, potpourri, oregano and anise seed spicing up the fresh-pressed boysenberry fruit. A wondrous array of peppercorns and tart black fruit show once sipped, with elderberry and underripe black currants mixed amongst fennel, dill, oregano and charred meats."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Stellenbosch,DeMorgenzon,35.0,93.0,"There's a lovely vibrancy to the nose of this wine, as initial aromas of green melon and lime peel are laced with attractive herbal hits of fynbos and white flowers. The medium-weight palate offers a plush yet balanced feel, with ample acidity to counter the notes of toasted red apple, honeydew and honeycomb. Spicy wood tones dance on the lingering finish. It's delicious now, but should age well through 2021."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Baileyana,35.0,93.0,"Named for a small volcanic outcrop on the Niven family's sprawling property, this bottling from winemaker Christian Roguenant shows hearty black cherry, vanilla and star anise spice on the nose. The palate is extremely floral, with lavender, violet and elderflower scents, along with plum skin and crushed-slate flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Wrath,35.0,93.0,"Honey, white peach and vanilla cream show on the nose of this bottling from winemaker Sabrine Rodem, with a kick of hazelnut as well. The palate is all about restrained richness, its buttery lemon curd and cinnamon flavors cut by bright acidity and a lemon-peel tang."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,35.0,93.0,"There is something eternally invigorating in this citrus-pure Riesling that smacks of grapefruit and lemon zest. There is a softer apple aspect too, uniting all in a fresh, pure fruitiness. There is something simply authentic at its very heart that keeps you sipping. And with such a light-bodied wine, you can (almost) do so with impunity."
Malbec,US,Washington,àMaurice,35.0,93.0,"While this wine starts out a bit reductive, it subsequently explodes with aromas of dried herbs and generous amounts of black pepper. It's palate-coating and mesmerizing in feel, showing a dazzling sense of texture, lightness and richness."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Rocca delle Macìe,35.0,93.0,"Structured and polished, this opens with aromas that recall dark berry, leather, blue flowers, toasted oak, mint and spice. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, espresso, cedar, menthol and licorice alongside assertive but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2021."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Brian Carter Cellars,35.0,93.0,"This inaugural release of Brian Carter's “Spanish Style Blend” is 70% Stone Tree vineyard Tempranillo. Carter is a supremely skillful and thoughtful blender, and the result is a luscious, mouthwatering bottle of wine that opens with a perfect mix of berries and light chocolate; scents of spice and mint; and a palate-pleasing streak of bacon fat that lingers happily in the mouth."
Syrah,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Esporão,35.0,93.0,"This is a gorgeous wine that's driven by notes of spice and new wood. The wood is supported by ripe flavors of plum, damson and blackberry juice, with tight acidity. The Alentejo's dry climate is certainly suited to Syrah, producing fine structure. Age for 3–4 years."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,35.0,93.0,"The steep slopes of the Monts Damnés are some of the best known in Sancerre. From grapes grown on this almost vertiginous slope, this wine is concentrated from the low yields and wonderfully juicy, fresh fruits. Apple and spiced pear flavors are totally freshened by the bright, crisp acidity. Drink from 2017."
Dornfelder,US,California,Cambiata,35.0,93.0,"An incredibly dark wine by veteran winemaker Eric Laumann, this rarely tapped varietal offers lush and deep aromas of blackberry pie, black currant syrup, licorice soda and mint-chip ice cream. Velvety, tongue-tingling and extremely lengthy on the palate, it shows almost port-like flavors of milk chocolate, blueberry juice, peppery mint, cherry liqueur-filled chocolate and ripe raspberry-cranberry juice."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Gérard Bertrand,35.0,93.0,"This is a dense, concentrated and expressive wine, although it's still young and promises more beauty and elegance with age. Aromas of African violets and cocoa nibs marry harmoniously with the fleshy black-fruit core. Jammy, ripe plum and cherry flavors lead the lush and slightly creamy palate, transitioning into notes of roasted coffee and chocolate, and finally ending on a sweet toasted-oak and baking-spice accent. It's richly delicious now, but patience will also be rewarded; try after 2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,J. Lohr,35.0,93.0,"This appealing wine is widely available. Blueberry, vanilla cream and gingerbread make for an inviting nose. The palate packs layers of intriguing, ripe and easily lovable flavors: baked strawberries, vanilla ice cream, blueberry sauce and baking spice."
Syrah,US,California,Left Bend,35.0,93.0,"A bit lighter that other Syrahs of this small appellation, this bottling from a Santa Cruz-based producer shows light cherry juice, cinnamon, clove and gingerbread on the nose. Cola, black cherry, cranberry, leather and tobacco arise on the sip, but it's the intriguing crushed-gravel minerality that sets it apart."
Chardonnay,US,California,Walt,35.0,93.0,"Rich sugar-apple and pear tart provide warmth and decadence to this wine. Despite its voluptuous nature, the wine is also layered and complex in intriguingly satisfying ways. A touch of ripe peach and salty pretzel figure into the mix quietly, yet harmoniously."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Domdechant Werner,35.0,93.0,"Green floral notes and juicy, ripe white peaches perfume this complex medium-sweet Riesling. It's ethereal on the palate but penetrating with stone fruit flavors and a sunny, bright tangerine acidity. Finishes with a lingering slick of wet-stone minerality."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Dão,Sogrape,35.0,93.0,"Touriga Nacional is as much, maybe more, at home in the Dão as in the Douro. That's shown by this ripe and powerful wine that is still so young. The dark structure of tannins and wood flavors has a great mineral texture along with the potential for delicious blackberry fruits. It needs several years aging, wait until 2018."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Avennia,35.0,93.0,"The name pays homage to the Graves region of Bordeaux, and the blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc also mimics those wines. Here the grapes are sourced from the Red Willow (Yakima Valley), Bacchus (Columbia Basin) and Klipsun (Red Mountain) vineyards. Supple, with beautifully integrated red fruits, and tannins as soft as a kiss, it's masterful winemaking from Chris Peterson, who tended the wines of DeLille for many years."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Weninger,35.0,93.0,"A complex, concentrated wine. It shows richness as well as tense minerality, the ripe black berry flavors melding with firm tannins. Alte Reben is old vines,  impressive and designed for aging."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Falcone,35.0,93.0,"Roasted beef and pork aromas are interspersed with cherry, blackberry, black currant, dried herbs and just enough cooked bell pepper to know it's a Cab. The palate is all about meaty fun, like cherry-crusted tenderloin topped with herbed béarnaise sauce, finishing on rustic elderberry, cigar and menthol flavors."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Graziano Merotto,35.0,93.0,"Alluring scents of hawthorn, citrus blossom and ripe orchard fruit come together on this lovely sparkler. On the dry palate, nectarine zest and crushed herbs underscore a core of yellow apple and Bartlett pear. It's well balanced, with vibrant acidity and a creamy mousse that lends finesse."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Arndorfer,35.0,93.0,"Creamy, almost mellow notes of ripe yellow apple constitute the nose. The palate intensifies that creaminess with hints of vanilla and burnt sugar as well as with a finely fizzing, creamy mousse. All this is countered and balanced by sprightly freshness. Overall it conveys an opulent, hedonistic style, with an expressive and long finish reminiscent of salted caramel."
Merlot,US,California,Sextant,35.0,93.0,"This is a very delicious and accessible wine for all palates, both lavish in style and complex. Candied blackberry, fragrant rose and fennel pollen aromas introduce a palate of baked red fruit, maple syrup and brown sugar flavors. That fruit-forward richness is balanced by extreme floral character and lively acidity."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Tranche,35.0,93.0,"Held back for almost five years, this GSM (plus a dash of Cinsault) is thoroughly delicious and drinking beautifully. It's toasty and dark, packed with black cherry and cassis fruit, along with strong streaks of wood smoke, graphite, black olive and mineral. Cellar until 2024 at least."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Luneau-Papin,35.0,93.0,"A wonderfully balanced wine, rich, rounded but showing off the crispness, the tightness of great Muscadet. There is a yeasty, creamy element here, from its 30 month's aging on the lees before bottling, but this just makes the crispness even more exciting."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade dos Grous,35.0,93.0,"Harvested according to the moon cycle, this wine is dense, complex and concentrated. With the dark color typical of the red grape Alicante Bouschet, the wine also has rich, smoky tannins and firm black fruits. It is going to need some more aging, so drink from 2018."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Chambert,35.0,93.0,"The Chambert estate was first planted in 1690. Now owned by Philippe Lejeune, it is farmed biodynamically. With consultant Stéphane Derenoncourt as part of the team, this top wine from the estate's best parcels is concentrated, dense and firmly tannic. The wine's young acidity and structure are in place so it just needs time to age. Drink from 2020."
Assyrtiko,Greece,Santorini,Domaine Sigalas,35.0,93.0,"Brisk lemon and lime peel aromas are followed by delicate flavors of grapefruit, white peach and sea salt in this sophisticated white. Elegant and exotic, it has an ageable character and a versatile, food-friendly style. Beautifully rendered and a testament to Santorini terroir."
Syrah,US,California,Occasio,35.0,93.0,"With aromas like boysenberry and blackberry jam and flavors that fill the mouth and linger on the finish, this wine is pure, dark and delicious. Not that it's soft and sweet, but instead is dry, very firm in texture while very friendly and concentrated in flavor. Best to drink from 2018 to 2023."
Chardonnay,US,California,Cenay,35.0,93.0,"A unique nose of chives, dill and more fresh-cut herbs mixes with wet river stones and tangerine peel on this wine from a Napa-based producer. The energetic palate starts with pencil lead before diving into washes of lemon-lime citrus and settling on a cashew-nut frame, presented with tremendous length and depth."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Falcone,35.0,93.0,"This bottling is simply delicious and accessible to all sorts of wine lovers right out of the gate. Black cherry pie, brown sugar and purple flower aromas lead to a palate of cherry, vanilla, licorice and milk chocolate. A silky mouthfeel completes the experience."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Shaw,35.0,93.0,"A contrast to the producer's fresh and fruity unoaked Cab Franc, Shaw's late-release reserve bottling showcases the massive concentration and depth found within the same grape variety in NY. Blackberry and cherry flavors are lush and ripe, intensified by regal tones of wet soil, spice, vanilla and tobacco. It's a powerful richly textured wine that should continue to develop well through 2025."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Terlan,35.0,93.0,"Tomato vine, cut grass, crushed stone and grapefruit aromas almost leap out of the glass. The crisp savory palate delivers juicy citrus, ripe honeydew melon, Alpine herb and a mineral note framed in bright acidity. It has a bright, clean finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Romaneira,35.0,93.0,"The estate wine of Romaneira is aged for 14 months in wood. This doesn't mask the fruit although it certainly gives it extra richness. Dark and structured, the black fruit is laced with licorice, spice and firm tannins. The wine will benefit from time, so drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Rochioli,35.0,93.0,"Exotic wafts of almond and lemongrass make way for an intensity of lemon pith and grapefruit in this wholly satisfying, well-crafted and refreshingly complex white, a sure sign that this variety can thrive in the appellation."
Syrah,US,California,City Winery Chicago,35.0,93.0,"It's amazing how wineries across the country can take Central Coast fruit and make it sing, but this producer certainly does. Lavish vanilla, cola and ripe black cherries invite the nose with glee. Then the palate blends black cherry and black plum with caramel and mocha notes in this crowd-pleaser."
Barbera,US,Washington,Casa Smith,35.0,93.0,"What's this? Single-vineyard Barbera coming from The Rocks District? It's a stunner, with notes of crushed rock and gravel, red and black currants and smoke that show outrageous minerality. The mouthfeel is flat out stunning, showing subtlety and suppleness, with fruit and savory flavors lingering on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Elizabeth Chambers,35.0,93.0,"This is lovely in color, scent and flavor. Elegant and complex, it's perfect for near-term drinking. The strawberry fruit carries some darker highlights, and flavors from aging in 100% French oak bring a lightly charred, toasty frame around the lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Alloro,35.0,93.0,"A sensational bottle at this price, it's ripe and textural, with a plush mix of strawberry and cherry fruit. The flavors evolve throughout a lengthy finish, adding layers of chocolate, malt and caramel, all in beautiful proportion."
Chardonnay,US,California,Presqu'ile,35.0,93.0,"Light and clean aromas of Asian pear, pear blossoms, apple flesh and white flowers show on the nose of this bottling from a property on the far western edge of the maritime appellation. Bright acidity presents flavors of lime, green apples, Anjou pear flesh and a touch of kiwi, with savory sea-salt touches."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,Terredora,35.0,93.0,"Attractive aromas of pipe tobacco, plum and baking spice lead the nose. The tight, elegant palate delivers wild cherry, blackberry, licorice and a hint of mineral framed in austere fine-grained tannins that lend firm structure and polished texture. Fresh acidity provides balance. Give it time to unwind. Drink 2020–2030."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Masson-Blondelet,35.0,93.0,"Full apricot and peach fruits give this wine a rich, warm character. It hasn't lost sight of its mineral, textured origins that shine through and give the wine shape. The fruit is pure on this impressive, ripe while structured wine. Drink from late 2015."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,35.0,93.0,"Ripe Mirabelle and purple plums dominate the nose, with a notion of intense plum compote. The palate reveals that all of this ripeness is streaked with lively lemon zest, pulling the sumptuous fruit into clearer focus. The finish remains ripe and opulent."
Pinot Blanc,Austria,Leithaberg,Hillinger,35.0,93.0,"Delicately floral with subtle notes of ripe pear and fresh lemon, this charmer features a soft but defined palate. The creamy, pliable texture is rather seductive and far too easy to drink, so much so that one might forget what a well-made and ageworthy wine this is. The smoky glints of oak are most appealing."
St. Laurent,Austria,Burgenland,Steindorfer,35.0,93.0,"Lusciously ripe red cherry tinged with peppery spice sets the tone—this is dense with fruit but still light on its feet. Typically a finicky grape, this example of St. Laurent shows with style and grace. The palate is wonderfully balanced showing real resonance. While beautiful now, there is potential to develop. Drink now-2018."
Tocai,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Mario Schiopetto,35.0,93.0,"There is an amazing medley of aromas and flavors in this powerful Tocai. Aromas of perfumed spring blossom, almonds follow through on the palate with flavors of pears, almonds and spice, with just a touch of pepper."
Zinfandel,US,California,Maley Brothers Vineyards,35.0,93.0,"A lightly earthy, mineral-like quality in the aroma and flavor gives a distinct personality to this subtle and complex wine. Hints of wood smoke and grilled herbs play off a core of ripe, delicious, concentrated berry flavors while firm tannins and a great sense of balance keep it appetizing through the finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Kangarilla Road,35.0,93.0,"Mint, black cherries and mocha aromas and flavors swirl together easily in this full-bodied Shiraz. It's burly without being overdone, the tannins coming together in a silky vein on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2030."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Buty,35.0,93.0,"This is one of the stars of the vintage in 2010; the Conner Lee fruit is rich and fully ripe, with a pleasingly candied aspect. Yet it remains lively with bracing acids, citrus and apple, and highlights of toasted nuts and caramel. A big, grin-inducing wine that is virtually irresistible."
Rhône-style White Blend,Canada,British Columbia,Le Vieux Pin,35.0,93.0,"A brilliant blend of 61% Viognier, 21% Roussanne and 18% Marsanne, this impresses with its proportion, tension and balance. Scents and flavors meld citrus oil and rind, fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and Meyer lemon, and a lovely finish with highlights of English breakfast tea. Long and elegant, this is a landmark effort."
Syrah,US,California,Left Bend,35.0,93.0,"Winemaker Gary Robinson named this brand after the San Andreas Fault, which caused the appellation that birthed this aromatic display of blueberry, lilac and hummingbird sage. Dense purple fruit flavors consume the hedonistic palate, which is bolstered by bacon fat, licorice and a strong and lively acidity."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Fieuzal,35.0,93.0,"Ripe and tropical, this full-bodied wine conveys mango, quince and ripe white peach that accompany a rich texture. It's going to develop relatively quickly, so drink from 2018. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001. A new winery and barrel cellar opened in 2011. Hubert de Boüard of Château Angelus consults with Carrier. Fieuzal's newsletter is an accurate report on harvests."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Moulin de la Bridane,35.0,93.0,"From one of the few estates in Saint-Julien that is not a classified growth, this wine represents a bargain. The wine is rich, perfumed and beautifully structured. It has a velvety consistency with its ripe black currants and generous tannins. The estate is named after the mill belonging to Abbot Bridane in the Middle Ages. Drink from 2022."
Zinfandel,US,California,St. Amant,35.0,93.0,"This is one of the best Lodi Native wine yet. It has beautiful, soft, fruit and floral aromas, luxurious and soothing berry and black-currant flavors and a layered texture that seems to melt in the mouth. It's full bodied, braced by fine-grained tannins, and seems to unfold nuance after nuance with each sip before lingering nicely on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Balthasar Ress,35.0,93.0,"Electric acidity penetrates through this sumptuously fruity wine full of rich white-peach and grapefruit flavors. Vibrantly fresh and floral, it's sharpened by a razor's edge of minerality that lingers through the finish. It's gorgeous now for its ebullience and youth but should improve well into the 2020's."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,34.0,93.0,"A very slight citrus lift, edged with ripe pineapple, on the nose announces a precise palate of lusciously ripe flavors: sun-ripened yellow mirabelle plums nestle alongside ripe oranges and clementimes. A straight, linear but ripe acidity at the very core keeps all of this fruit in check and provides direction and precision. Delicious and long."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,34.0,93.0,"Chalk and slate notes juxtapose fragrant, sweet-tart tangerine, lime and lemon on the nose and palate of this laser-edged kabinett. A kiss of honey gives the midpalate just a touch of sweetness that lingers long on the finish."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Schloss Gobelsburg,34.0,93.0,"Flinty reduction hovers on the nose before the palate brings lemony freshness to the fore. While stony notes persist, lemon brightness and a fine, creamy mousse make for a superfresh and elegant body. The finish is dry and long. This wine is lovely now but will reward cellaring. Drink 2017–2022."
Chardonnay,US,California,Transcendence,34.0,93.0,"A successful exploration of how Chardonnay can be both sharp with green fruit yet full in body, this bottling offers just-cut kiwi, crisp Asian and Anjou pear, lemon wedges and underripe mandarin on the chalky nose. A strong simmering acidity and intriguing texturality present flavors of lemongrass and green-apple flesh, with tangy lime pith in the background. Drink now while fresh."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Romaneira,34.0,93.0,"From a great year in the Douro, this is a complex, impressive wine. It has elegance rather than brute power, pushed forward by smooth yet dry tannins and ripe black fruits. A touch of spice, balanced acidity and a great potential for aging. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Alloro,34.0,93.0,"As Willamette Valley vintners continually improve and redefine Oregon Chardonnay, a distinctive profile is emerging. This vivid and taut mineral-driven wine could be the poster child. The citrus, apples and pears bring a light touch of baking spices, extended length and surefire ageability. Plus, it's a fine value for a wine of such quality."
Zinfandel,US,California,Three,34.0,93.0,"Big, powerful and confidently ripe, this full-bodied wine oozes with luscious blackberry, wild sage and blueberry flavors that seemingly melt in the mouth. A great example of the late harvest style without being sweet, it's dry, concentrated and persistent on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,34.0,93.0,Hits of salt and crushed earth mingle amidst sweet tangerine and apricot in this revitalizing spätlese. It's intensely mineral yet chock full of summer fruit catapulted by searing lemon-lime acidity. The finish is marked with lingering notes of caramelized sugar and pollen.
Zinfandel,US,California,Harney Lane,34.0,93.0,"This distinctive, complex and layered wine brings a unique aromatic profile of raspberries, sage and spice before fanning out across the palate with gorgeous raspberry syrup, dark chocolate and blackberry flavors. Its lightly grippy texture of fine-grained tannins perfectly counters the plush effusiveness of its fruit."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,34.0,93.0,"Whiffs of Assam tea and honey permeate throughout this bright, bristling spätlese accenting succulent yellow peach and tangerine flavors. It's vibrant and brisk, but finishes on a sweet, meandering marmalade kiss. Stunning already but structured enough to evolve beautifully through at least 2025."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Alloro,34.0,93.0,"Initially this may strike some tasters as an unusual expression, but give it a chance and it may well become a favorite. There's an interesting component of crushed flowers in aroma and flavor, along with nut oil, butterscotch, pineapple and apple butter. It's all supported by a mineral-driven vein."
G-S-M,US,California,Transcendence,34.0,93.0,"Uplifting aromatics of blackberry soda and purple flowers provide a nose that could be sniffed all day, hinting at a fun but elegant GSM. The flavors fall in line, with cola, Bing cherries and rose water combining for a light, floral palate, yet with green tea tannins and tartness to keep it grounded."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Grand Boise,34.0,93.0,"This lightly wood-aged wine, from an estate that has only changed hands three times in 400 years, is crisp, tight and very young. It has fine potential for the future. There are elegant fruits, spice and intense acidity that needs to soften. Produced from selected high-altitude parcels, the wine is balanced between the tangy texture and mineral fruitiness. Drink from early 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,MacRostie,34.0,93.0,"This wine is the sum of many spectacular sites—including Ritchie and Heintz Vineyards—some of the cooler-climate spots for grapes in the Occidental. Together they sing a tasteful tune that's salty and demure, with an elegant imprint of green apple, ocean breeze and stone."
Alsace white blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,34.0,93.0,"Hints of peach and blossom tell of aromatic varieties in this field blend. The palate confirms this with the rich, almost oily texture of rose oil. This is off dry but balanced: the richness seems to be contained in a cloud that bursts into aromatic atoms the moment you swallow. This makes you long for more and want to delve into the earthy, chalky depths."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Peter Jakob Kühn,34.0,93.0,"Steel and honey meld from nose to finish in this light-footed dry Riesling. The palate boasts spine-tingling lime and lemon flavors intensified by a concentrated sheen of petrol. It's a spry, deeply mineral wine that finishes with remarkable persistence."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Michel Vattan,34.0,93.0,"From a number of old-vine parcels, designated in the past as L-O and only produced in the best years, this wine is beautifully ripe with great layers of rich apple and pear fruits. They are cut with zesty acidity and a more mineral aspect. The wine still needs to age further, so drink from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Mark David,34.0,93.0,"This wine comes from a partnership between winemaker David Galzignato of Jada Winery in Paso Robles, and Mark McWilliams of Arista Winery in Healdsburg. A devotion to Sauvignon Blanc, it succeeds with this sophisticated expression of lemon chiffon and mandarin orange that's bright and complex. With two handfuls of Sémillon to the mix, it's medium in body and length, with just the slightest suggestion of caramel-vanilla oak."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Aequorea,34.0,93.0,"This wine offers very yellow aromas of stewed lemons, pound cake, egg flour, peach blossom, ambrosia melon and even a shy bit of hazelnut on the nose. The fascinating palate shows orange sponge cake, acacia flower, dried papaya, stone fruits and a pithy minerality. Scents and flavors are altogether mysterious yet delicious."
Merlot,US,California,G & L Lurton,34.0,93.0,"From the producer's organically farmed estate, this light elegant red is Old World in approach and execution, offering delicate aromas of leather pouch and black pepper. Wraparound tannins provide structure within a graceful framework of plum and cedar, as the oak integrates to preserve a freshness of acidity and lively complexity."
Syrah,US,Washington,Burnt Bridge,34.0,93.0,"Lovely aromatics introduce this single vineyard Syrah with a snootfull of raspberry, pomegranate, cherry and rock. There's an elusive whiff of diesel also, lifting the palate of this very young, very compact wine. This could easily go 8–10 years in the cellar."
Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay,Austria,Burgenland,Steindorfer,34.0,93.0,"This is a honeyed wine, with a strong showing of ginger marmalade and bright acidity. It's full in the mouth and layered with acidity and lush, unctuous flavors. It shows great aging potential; drink from 2015."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bravium,34.0,93.0,"An ethereal Pinot from high atop Mendocino Ridge, sourced from just one block of the Signal Ridge Vineyard, this wine is a gorgeous glass of strawberry and cherry compote, with a pungency of pomegranate. Soft, well-integrated and zinging with acidity, this unfined and unfiltered Pinot is well worth seeking out."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,DanCin,34.0,93.0,"Though labeled simply “Oregon,” this is 100% Hyland vineyard fruit from the McMinnville AVA. Done in a refined, lightly smoky style, it pushes subtle berry flavors into a substantial midpalate laden with highlights of milk chocolate, café crème and a touch of caramel. Smooth as silk, this will be tough to ignore in your cellar, though it will reward another three to five years of bottle age."
Syrah,Canada,British Columbia,Vanessa,34.0,93.0,"For those who want a little funk in their Syrah, this conjures up flavors reminiscent of wines from the Rocks District in Walla Walla. Credit the rocky soil of this Similkameen Valley vineyard, which delivers dense, well-knit flavors of red and purple fruits, smoke, tanned leather, tobacco and licorice. Concentrated flavors of raspberry purée hold down the core."
Chardonnay,US,California,Anaba,34.0,93.0,"This is the winery's first bottling of estate Chardonnay, from a vineyard on the western edges of Carneros named for the owner's two children. Ephemeral and crisp, it speaks to its cooler conditions, exhibiting low oak impact around lilting, floral notes of citrus. Salty, with a restrained hint of vanilla and coconut, it finishes lengthy and complex."
Zinfandel,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,34.0,93.0,"Sanguine and restrained, this is a lovely version of the variety from the region. It is high-toned in refreshing acidity and accented in red cherry and a memorable spiciness of cinnamon and pepper. Completely understated, it will do well at the table or on its own as aperitif fare."
Malbec,US,Washington,William Church,34.0,93.0,"The best bottle in a strong 2010 William Church lineup, this pure, single-vineyard Malbec is flat-out lovely. Deep purple fruits—plums and cherries—meet silky tannins and just the right touch of French oak, a mix of new, once used and neutral. Young, compact and dense, it should reward up to a decade of cellaring."
Syrah-Grenache,US,Washington,àMaurice,34.0,93.0,"The addition of 28% Grenache brings a punchy, upfront fruitiness to the umami-soaked Syrah. Tangy orange/raspberry fruit is concentrated and fills the mouth; then the peppery, earthy Syrah backbone brings flesh to the finish. Beautifully proportioned."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Pianetta,34.0,93.0,"Blackberry-laced chocolate syrup, black cherry extract, freshly tanned leather and sweet tobacco leaf join forces to power a remarkable wine from this winery near San Miguel, where the owning family first planted vines in 1997. The palate shows black olives, leather, tobacco, clove, black cardamom and dried black cherries, all held together by solid tannic grip."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Domaine de Cause,34.0,93.0,"A powerful, long-term wine. Its density and great concentration all show a solid, powerful character. Jammy black fruits combine with dark tannins and acidity in an already balanced wine. Hold for 4–5 years, but with the sweet fruit, it could be consumed younger."
Syrah,US,California,Novy,34.0,93.0,"Pinot Noir pro Adam Lee shows his Rhône colors with this cool-climate bottling that offers scents of black pepper, violets, purple fruit and fried pork. It's both lush and energetic on the palate, presenting dark blackberry flavors but with acidic verve. An exciting look at the grape's varied potential."
Sylvaner,France,Alsace,Boeckel,34.0,93.0,"Incredible purity rises from the glass, reminiscent of iced pear slices on a bed of the freshest chervil. The palate is filigree and savory, lithe, translucent but intense and shimmering with stone and earth, with pear and apple, with chervil and tangy peel. What light-footed, concentrated and yet elegant joy. This is resolutely dry and shows what Sylvaner does in the right hands."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,34.0,93.0,"Hints of saffron and pollen lend spice and earthiness to this spine tingling but juicy spätlese full of zesty tangerine, lime and yellow peach flavors. It's sheer and spry initially, but builds in fruity, mineral intensity through a long, lingering finish. Drink now through 2025."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Albert Mann,34.0,93.0,"Rich, full bodied and medium dry, it is powered by ripe fruits, lychees and pomegranates. A spicy undertow brings along some acidity to this concentrated wine. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Jean-Marc Brocard,34.0,93.0,"A tight, crisp wine from vineyards that face across the river to the town of Chablis. The wine has delicious yellow fruits, intense acidity and an opulent character. The vines of the vineyard face east giving warmth while keeping a strong mineral texture. Drink this wine from 2019."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Jean-Marc Bernhard,34.0,93.0,"The nose is a very enticing mix of rose petal and peach, grapefruit zest and musky spice. The palate echoes the same flavors and is both intense and concentrated. There is residual sweetness making all the fruit flavors luscious and plump, countered by sprightly fresh acidity that results in an over all medium-sweet wine. The flavors are precise and clean and so is the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Le Crock,34.0,93.0,"Owned by the Cuvelier family of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien and with Michel Rolland as consultant, this is a fine estate with an equally fine chateau. It is dense and richly endowed with black fruits and spice. At the same time, it has style and a way with its fruit and acidity that give it a lift. Drink this very ageworthy wine from 2023."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Burgenland,Weninger,34.0,93.0,"Spicy oak flavors dominate the nose and marry beautifully with the red berry, cherry and forest floor notes. This is Pinot made in an international style that nonetheless keeps its Austrian backbone of fresh acidity and lovely, tingling pepper spice. The fact that this is from 2010 and has just began to show its colors signals its seriousness. It is ready now but will also reward further cellaring. Such depth and length at 12.5% are a real achievement—in its own wonderful way, Pinot is never about power."
Chardonnay,US,California,Failla,34.0,93.0,"In this crisp, tangy white from a cool-climate home, tangerine and pineapple play off each other around a fluffy backbone and structured minerality. More of that tang comes to the fore on the finish, this being a bang-for-your-buck kind of wine that will delight at the dinner table or in the kitchen while cooking."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Jean-Marc Bernhard,34.0,93.0,"Now fully evolved, this is a rich, sweet wine, very ripe and spicy. Balancing the soft texture, the wine has honeyed acidity that shows some freshness. It's a superb wine that is now ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Ferrari-Carano,34.0,93.0,"Smooth, harmonious and seductive, this full-bodied but elegantly structured Pinot has deep red color and lots of fresh, ripe fruit flavor. It offers a texture as smooth as silk and a finish that lingers for 30 seconds. Vibrant acidity and firm tannins help to keep it fresh and vital. Enjoy now through 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,34.0,93.0,"Savory whiffs of lemongrass and tilled earth turn surprisingly floral and fruity on the palate of this complex yet quaffable spätlese. Sweet, sun-kissed tangerine and peach flavors are unctuous and satisfying, off set by zesty lime acidity. The finish is long, peppered by notes of pollen, herb and fennel."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Brophy Clark,34.0,93.0,"Nearing the 20-year anniversary of their winery, career vintners John Clark and Kelley Brophy Clark make solid wines such as this one, which shows marjoram, cardamom and crushed rose-petal aromas against a pomegranate juice frame. It's lush and lively once sipped, with dried strawberries and raspberries lifted with lavender and pencil lead, all flavors that keep going and going."
Syrah,US,California,Shane Wines,34.0,93.0,"This wine forms a beautiful union of sweet, spicy oak with dark, brooding fruit and black-pepper flavors from the grapes. It smells complex and spicy, like cinnamon, clove and cedar backed by concentrated flavors of black cherry, pepper and clove. Built to age, this will drink best after 2019."
Red Blend,Spain,Central Spain,Finca Coronado,34.0,93.0,"Fans of Miguel Angel de Gregorio's Finca Allende wines from Rioja will want to snap up this excellent, lush-styled blend of Graciano, Merlot and Petit Verdot from La Mancha. This wine almost proves that talent is as important as terroir, because no other La Mancha wine features this grape blend, these rich and pure medicinal flavors, and a smooth-handed sense of balance that calls for drinking now through 2013."
White Blend,US,California,Carlisle,34.0,93.0,"A stunning field blend of Gewürztraminer, Trousseau Gris and Riesling, this works in every way. It opens with a fragrance of jasmine and roses on the nose, followed by light, subtle undertones of lilting citrus and lychee. Remaining dry throughout, the finish a study in balance and structure."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Bava,33.0,93.0,"Alluring aromas of dark-skinned berry, exotic spice and an earthy note of tilled soil come together in the glass. The elegant, structured palate delivers red currant, Marasca cherry and star anise alongside bright acidity and refined tannins. It's well balanced and delicious. Drink through 2022."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Windrun,33.0,93.0,"This vintage delivers a wine with deep and rustic cherry, boysenberry, sweet herb and rose aromas, the latter contributing a penetrating floral dimension. Pure raspberry, potpourri and thyme notes pop on the palate, where clean acidity and tight tannins provide a light frame and carry the flavors toward a caramelized finish."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio Basconcillos,33.0,93.0,"Ultraripe aromas of blackberry, cassis, raisin, tobacco and vanilla lead to a plush flush palate with kick-ass tannins. This tastes of baked blackberry, cassis and chocolate, while the finish is stout and dense as a brick. If you like full-bodied, ripe and saturated reds, this was made for you. Drink through 2025."
Grenache,Australia,South Australia,Mr. Riggs,33.0,93.0,"Not many $30 wines can offer fruit from 100-year-old vines, but this one does. It's full bodied and rich, with notes of plum and black cherries supported by hints of chocolate and vanilla. With its long, velvety finish, there's no reason to defer gratification, although it should drink well through at least 2020."
Zinfandel,US,California,Chacewater,33.0,93.0,"Simply delicious, this Zin is well mannered and not too full bodied. Aromas of this dry and elegant wine are like cinnamon and cardamom, and flavors are a little smoky and full of cherries. The mouthfeel is good and gripping due to fine tannins and supportive acidity."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Joh. Jos. Prüm,33.0,93.0,"Deep, dusty slate and smoke tones rim the edges of this sleek, laser-edged Kabinett. It's intensely concentrated in lemon and lime flavors, but darkly mineral as well, finishing on sweet-tart hits of citrus and salt. Delicious now, it should only improve over the next decade."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière,33.0,93.0,"You can tell this is a prestige cuvée by the weight and shape of the bottle. The wine does justify its packaging, a rich and smooth offering that's structured and textured without losing sight of generous fruitiness. Orange peel combines with red berries to give a full while fresh wine. Try aging it for a few more months and drink at the end of 2015."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Malat,33.0,93.0,"Crushed apricot flesh framed by mandarin and lemon freshness sets the tone. Where the nose is full of charm, the palate is full of verve. Exciting, almost electric freshness flashes on the palate and makes for a dynamic, streamlined but structured drink. Somewhere in the background, notes of honey lurk deliciously."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,33.0,93.0,"Rounded, plump little apricots are suggested in this clean-cut but ripe and dry Riesling with its straight, mineral backbone and impressive balance. A deep and rich core of fruit will unveil layers of fruit and complexity over years to come. Drink as of 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Laporte,33.0,93.0,"Produced from a single parcel, whose origins go back to 1492, this fresh, herbal and crisp wine is fruity and complex at the same time. Intense acidity is allied with pineapple and apricot flavors. The elegant mineral texture cuts through the fruitiness, giving a fine structure. The wine is now ready to drink."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Markus Molitor,33.0,93.0,"Dramatically ripe, this delicately framed spätlese is a showcase of pristine, sunny peach and Meyer lemon flavors accented by caramel and crystallized honey. It's nuanced as well, darting with acidity and touches of sea salt and slate that persist."
Grenache-Carignan,Spain,Catalonia,Cellers Unió,33.0,93.0,"This red opens with reticent jammy aromas that expand to include licorice and asphalt notes. The wine is so saturated that it weighs down on the palate. Flavors of savory berry fruits are matched by saucy tomato and spice notes. On a sinewy finish, tomato sauce, raspberry and red-plum flavors stick out. Drink through 2026."
Chardonnay,US,California,Keller Estate,33.0,93.0,"Golden hay in color, this fragrant, vineyard-designated estate wine offers floral jasmine on the nose before delving into notes of minerality and savory herb. Substantial on the palate without becoming overbearing, it's both elegant and memorable."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Domdechant Werner,33.0,93.0,"While the nose is a bit cool, suggesting tart, green notes of melon rind and apple, the palate of this late-harvest Riesling is unctuously ripe. It's boldly honeyed yet pristine in fruit character, suggesting sun-kissed yellow cherries and tangerines. The palate is concentrated and forward but balanced by zesty acidity and a lingering, delicately sweet finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Chacewater,33.0,93.0,"This wine is subtle at first, but each sip brings more richness, nuance and layers. Soft, lightly spicy vanilla aromas lead the nose while Bosc pear, cream and marzipan flavors unfold on the palate. The texture is rich from the beginning and seems to grow more luxurious as it opens, lingering long into the finish."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Beronia,33.0,93.0,"This wine is absolutely what fans of traditional Rioja should be on the lookout for. It's smooth, elegant and complex on the bouquet, the perfect introduction to a firm yet classy palate, with berry, plum, spice, tobacco and vanilla flavors. Dry, toasty and just right on the finish. Drink now–2020."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Proprietà Sperino,33.0,93.0,"What a delightful wine this is. Loaded with finesse, it opens with lovely scents of red berry, crushed rose, graphite, cooking spice and Alpine herb. The beguiling medium-bodied palate offers sour cherry, raspberry, white pepper and mineral while fresh acidity and polished tannins provide impeccable balance. It's already drinking beautifully but will also provide several more years of pure enjoyment."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Lambert,33.0,93.0,"Scents of vanilla and baking spices frame bold raspberry fruit on the nose, while the flavors take a more savory turn, toward mocha and grilled meat. This is full bodied and maybe even a touch warm, but it works, ending long and plush. Drink now–2025."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Thistledown,33.0,93.0,"This wine was aged in hogsheads (300 liter) and demi-muids (500 liter). The oak provides a subtle frame, adding hints of pencil shavings and scorched pie crust to the ripe berry flavors. The wine is still big, lush and unmistakably Barossa Valley, showing off raspberries and blueberries to an unusual (and welcome) extent. Supple enough to drink now, it should also age well through at least 2025."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Müller-Grossmann,33.0,93.0,"The very pure scent of freshly cut Conference pear subtly presents itself on the nose. The palate continues in the same, friendly and evocative vein, adding notions of ripe stone fruit, subtle melon hints and a creamy, textured core of exquisite elegance. Cream and fruit vie for attention—but remain slender, citric and toned until the echoing last note."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Müller-Grossmann,33.0,93.0,"This wine opens with freshly peeled mandarin segments and notes of white blossom. The palate is soft, subtle in its flavors and full of appetizing and fruity juiciness. The Riesling backbone of zestiness makes itself felt on the clean, long and citrusy finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,33.0,93.0,"Violet-red in the glass, this wine has a nose of blackberries and gingerbread spice. It is well balanced, with equal amounts of velvety tannins and refreshing brightness cavorting on the palate. Pronounced flavors of blackberry, aniseed, smoke, flint and thyme are accentuated by notes of mint tea."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Spy Valley,33.0,93.0,"Envoy is Spy Valley's top range of bottlings. In this case, it's a single-vineyard wine that's fermented and matured in oak for 11 months. It's medium-bodied and silky in texture, with distinctive fumé notes, hints of struck match, and layers of passion fruit and grapefruit flavors. Dry, austere and long on the finish, it's a compelling example of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Rex Hill,33.0,93.0,"Sophisticated, complex winemaking is on display here. Perfectly ripe yellow and green fruits are entwined with leesy, textural, mineral-drenched acids. There are gentle touches of citrus rind and a finishing pat of butter. All in all, an exceptional wine for the price."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,33.0,93.0,"This wine is now in perfect condition. Just mature, it has great swathes of ripe plum and dark berry fruits that are textured with tight, spicy tannins. Balanced and rich, it shows mint and a concentrated structure. Drink now and until 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Cooper-Garrod,33.0,93.0,"Rich and lavish aromas of caramelized black cherry, cola, root beer and ginger cake make for broad and inviting entry to this wine. It's lighter in body and more tense than the nose suggests, but still ripe with strawberries and red cherries, framed by a grippy tannic structure ladened with pencil lead."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Domdechant Werner,33.0,93.0,"High-toned acidity lends raciness to this otherwise fleshy dry Riesling. Like many of the producer's 2015 dry wines, it's rich and densely structured, but the profile suggests crisper tones of lime, lemon and tangerine rather than stone fruit. The finish is a touch warm, but it's an undeniably attractive, powerful wine."
Grenache-Carignan,Spain,Catalonia,Cellers Unió,33.0,93.0,"Smooth, integrated aromas of cookie dough, forest floor and briary berry fruits lead to a palate that's plump on the edges but more intense and pulling in the middle. Flavors of ripe berry fruits, vanilla and tobacco finish with dry tannins and bold acidity, meaning this has more gas in the tank; drink through 2024."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Piro,32.0,93.0,"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well. Aromas of wild oregano, thyme, tapenade and red cherry lead into a palate full of tantalizing acidity, with tart Montmorency cherry, tangy tomato and fennel spice."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Secret Spot Wines,32.0,93.0,"This producer specializes in seeking out parcels of old vines. In this case, the vines, planted at high density, have unusually crooked trunks. The wine itself, richly tannic and dense, has new wood flavors, ripe black-plum fruits and a dark firm character. It is still young and will develop into an impressively rich wine. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Ehrhart,32.0,93.0,"Mango aromas and flavors give a sense of the sweetness of the wine. It is rich and full bodied, with spice and pepper notes just hinting at acidity. Keep the wine for 3–5 years."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südoststeiermark,Neumeister,32.0,93.0,"The restrained aromatics of wet grass and gentle smoke are the only reminders that this is Sauvignon Blanc. This is lightyears removed from the pungently fragrant style that has made the variety so popular—here, it comes in a grown-up, classy guise with wonderfully judged balance and a lovely midpalate weight."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Hager Matthias,32.0,93.0,"Dried fruit flavors and the bitter tang of dark fir honey are spiked by concentrated lemony acidity. The nose and palate are round and rich, but tamed by acidity that runs through like an electric current. This rich, dry but distinctly late-harvest style wine, with just a touch of residual sugar, finishes with triumphant apple fruit and lemon zest."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Jean-Paul Brun,32.0,93.0,"Although he is based in the Terres Dorées (golden earth) region of southern Beaujolais, this producer has an enviable palate of vineyards in the crus to the north. This wine comes from one. It has structure, density and a a solid core of both tannins and rich fruit. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Claiborne & Churchill,32.0,93.0,"Red cherry, vanilla, chaparral scrub and cranberry puree show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime estate, and then come the intriguing olive and Middle Eastern spices. The palate hones in on that Mediterranean spice character, with Kalamata olives blending into lavender, exotic mulberry and thyme-laced cherry-plum sauce."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,32.0,93.0,"Slightly more advanced notes stand out: a herbal tinge of sun-warmed, wild thyme has crept into the citrus peel which utterly dominates the palate. This sleek Smaragd has just started on its long ascent. It has the toned muscle and the stamina to go on and on—those who have enjoyed older vintages know of its near eternal youthfulness. On the aftertaste, herbal notes assert themselves again: dried tisane of verbena and dried apple punctuate with pleasant accents."
Zinfandel,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,32.0,93.0,"From vines averaging 95 years old, this is an impressive effort, in balance between savory, sultry overtones of peppercorn and espresso and a riper, juicier core of blackberry. Supportive acidity provides a freshness to the wine, which offers plenty of length and breadth on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,32.0,93.0,"Irresistably juicy and fruity, yet so delicately nuanced by spice, earth and mineral, this light-footed kabinett encapsulates much of what's so special about Mosel Riesling. The palate bursts with rich yellow peach and mango, but nervous lemon-lime acidity lends an electric vibe. It's delicious now but should improve through 2021."
Syrah,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,32.0,93.0,"Dense and chewy at first, this deliciously brooding wine is all about black licorice, berry and meat. Contoured layers of integrated tannin give it an understated elegance and sense of class despite its wild power and body."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Mollie,32.0,93.0,"This wine, made by a relative of the Jocko's Steak House family, is vibrant. Bright and racy, the welcoming nose offers light cinnamon notes, plump raspberries, dried rose petals and a touch of slate. The palate winds tight cranberry-raspberry fruit through layers of bay leaf and dark clay, finishing with a menthol character that lingers into the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Navarro,32.0,93.0,"This suave and sophisticated wine is so smooth to sip that its depth of flavor is a little deceptive. A subtle potpourri of clove, cinnamon, black tea and blackberry aromas swirl around a great core of mild acidity, fine-grained tannins and many layers of concentrated fruit flavor. The texture is velvety and the finish lingers for at least 30 seconds."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,JM Cellars,32.0,93.0,"As before, this features fruit from Conner-Lee, here with some Lewis vineyard grapes added to bring in more minerality. The result is a well-crafted mix of grapes from these two premier vineyards, with a tight core of chalk-laden citrus fruits. Persistent and resonant, the fruit is edged with citrus skin and brings a pat of butter at the end."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,32.0,93.0,"This serious wine is still developing even after five years. It is rich, dense and concentrated with firm tannins that lie under the ripe black fruits and acidity. From vineyards to the east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine has a mineral, structured character that needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lafond,32.0,93.0,"Chive and onion skin aromas blend with hints of mint, marcona almond and vanilla on the nose of this bottling from winemaker Bruce McGuire. From one of Pierre Lafond's special sites, it has a savory palate that recalls salted peanuts, seared lemon and popcorn on the finish. Lemony acidity cuts through it all."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Seven Hills,32.0,93.0,"This 100% Cabernet, from the iconic Klipsun vineyard, has been sourced from the original 1989 planting since the first crop, making Seven Hills Klipsun's longest standing customer. This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Gramercy,32.0,93.0,"This offers reserved notes of cherry and raspberry compote, cranberry, earth and assorted dried herbs. With the oak pleasantly dialed back, the focus remains on the fruit. The palate displays exquisite purity, elegance and detail, with a light grip of tannins pulling it all together. It's drinking beautifully now, but you could open it up in 2025 or 2030 and it wouldn't bat an eye."
Petit Verdot,US,Washington,Cloudlift Cellars,32.0,93.0,"Hailing from Elephant Mountain Vineyard, this new offering—blended with 15% Merlot—brings aromas of fresh and dried herbs, pencil lead, mocha, potting soil and flowers. It's rich and flavorful with coffee and cherry notes backed by exceptionally integrated tannins, all leading to a lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Sol Rouge,32.0,93.0,"This wine is concentrated, deep and tannic, yet nicely polished around the edges. It shows harmony between the vivid cranberry, black cherry, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors and the layered, fine tannins that give it a velvety texture. Drink now through 2022."
Jaen,Portugal,Dão,Quinta de Lemos,32.0,93.0,"The Jaen grape is specific to the Dão region of central Portugal, where it can produce dense wines with enormous color. This 2009, still surprisingly young for the variety, is dark, concentrated and generous, with sweet black plum notes balanced by hints of oak and lively acidity. This wine is worth holding onto. Drink after 2015."
Rosé,France,Provence,Chateau de Pibarnon,32.0,93.0,"The wine is rich—a beautiful blend dominated by Bandol's own Mourvèdre. The grapes gives both structure and a perfumed character to this ripe full wine. With acidity and layers of red fruits, it is worth aging. Drink from 2018."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Éric & Jöel Durand,32.0,93.0,"A finely perfumed wine, with powerful tannins but also excellent flavors of dark plums and ripe black fruits, with well-judged acidity and a sweet jelly character. This will develop relatively quickly for a Cornas, but still has all the right power and intensity."
Tinta Roriz,Portugal,Dão,Quinta de Lemos,32.0,93.0,"Tinta Roriz is one of the grapes that is very much at home on the granite soils of the Dão. Here winemaker Hugo Chavez produces a structured, densely tannic wine, swathed with loads of red fruit, with acidity to balance. This 100% Tinta Roriz is a powerful wine, needing more aging. Drink from 2016."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Saint-Rémy,32.0,93.0,"Tender notes of honeysuckle and rose rise from the glass. On the palate they perfume the generous peach and mirabelle plum fruit, supported by some residual sweetness. This strikes a very harmonious balance between tender opulence an sprightly freshness. The finish is intense, tangy, medium sweet and superbly balanced."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Spy Valley,32.0,93.0,"A tremendous effort from Spy Valley, this easily eclipses the winery's regular Sauvignon Blanc. Fig, melon and hints of vanilla mark the nose, while the palate amps up the citrus component, providing delineation to the nectarine flavors. It's on the full side of medium-bodied, with a silky, slightly creamy texture and a lingering finish that seamlessly blends citrus and stone fruit."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Vallana,32.0,93.0,"Mint, menthol, leather and wild berry aromas unfold in the glass, accompanied by a whiff of forest floor. The elegantly structured palate offers sour cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, white pepper and graphite alongside assertive but refined tannins and nervous acidity. Give this time to unwind and come together. Drink 2017–2030."
Garnacha,US,California,Twisted Oak,32.0,93.0,"What a wine. It tries to intimidate. At first, by its bottle size and alcohol level, but in the glass this 100% Garnacha is like a purring kitten—well a purring 20-pound Maine Coon cat, joyous in its pretty red fruit, and its earthy, meaty, vanilla and cinnamon toast range of goodness. All lush, Twisted Oak's Torcido is, like a retro soap opera, brave and beautiful."
Syrah,US,Washington,JM Cellars,32.0,93.0,"This wine kept improving in the glass over a period of hours, and as it did so, the score kept rising. Initial scents of Bourbon barrel gave way to rich blueberry and black cherry fruit, set in a roasted, potent mix of darker flavors. Smoke, coffee liqueur, a whiff of stem, a streak of vanilla, all tightly wound and elevated with scents of citrus peel."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Brander,32.0,93.0,"Freshly cut quince, guava, lemongrass and key lime aromas combine with a stony quality on the nose of this vibrant, zesty wine. Its acidity is almost effervescent, infusing the palate with boundless energy, while its chalky grip carries sharp green apple notes alongside warmer touches of pineapple and guava. Those vivid flavors linger for a full minute."
Red Blend,US,California,Derby,32.0,93.0,"From an aptly named vineyard, this whopper of a wine blends 37% Zinfandel, 32% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 15% Mourvèdre with 24% new oak and 20% whole-cluster fermentation. The result is a perfume that's both tart with boysenberry and rich with caramel, oak and cola. Black plum, gravel and bay leaf flavors surround its meaty core, persisting deep into the finish."
White Blend,Hungary,Tokaji,Oremus,32.0,93.0,"This late harvest sweet wine leads with delicate lemon blossom, canned peach, ripe apricot and mandarin orange aromas. It delivers white peach and apricot flavors on the palate, which is velvety smooth, with a restrained level of acidity to offset the sweetness."
Syrah,US,California,Sol Rouge,32.0,93.0,"Complex and meaty, this deeply colored Syrah from a family estate vineyard oozes flavors of toasted oak, pepper, grilled cherries (if there is such a thing) and grilled beef. There is more going on than just fruit and oak, as the earthy-spicy tones meld with fine-grain tannins. This kept getting better hours after opening and should mature well through 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Kokomo,32.0,93.0,"There's something special about this Zin, given a handful of Petite Sirah for aromatic depth. It opens with supple, high-toned raspberry and cherry before delving into a layering of dusty, cinnamon spice. Juicy, alive and fresh, it delivers a cherry-vanilla finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Donkey & Goat,32.0,93.0,"After making wine in Berkeley for just over a decade, the producer is working for the first time with Napa Valley fruit, grapes in fact farmed by grape-grower extraordinaire Steve Matthiasson. Pear, quince and grapefruit combine for a svelte sensibility, subtle in oak and sharp in acidity, with a tangy, herbal finish."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Dumas Station,32.0,93.0,"This 100% varietal wine brings notes of fresh herbs, red fruit, vanilla and clove. It's supple, textured and soft in feel with a captivating sense of balance, well-framed acidity, and lightly chalky tannins."
Merlot,US,Washington,Dumas Station,32.0,93.0,"Rarely does a Merlot in this price range display this much power and concentration. Sourced from several vineyards, it's ripe right to the border of raisin flavors, with generous dollops of maple syrup and brown sugar adding further complexity. Still fruit-driven, yet with plenty of barrel flavor, this massive Merlot can take your richest, tangiest barbecue sauce."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Wait Cellars,32.0,93.0,"Light in ruby-red, see-through red color, it's spicy and alive, with a silky cherry pit aroma and undercurrent of herbal earthiness. Balanced and soft, it can accompany a slow-roasted pork tenderloin adorned in morel mushrooms or a classic BLT. Of course, it's also stellar on its own."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Riglos,32.0,93.0,"While Argentine Malbecs aren't textbook cellaring wines, this one has enough spirit, tannin and structure to benefit from a few years on its side. Now, it's lush on the nose, with ripe berry, pencil eraser, vanilla and marzipan aromas. The palate is chewy but well built, with dense blackberry, cassis, coconut and chocolate flavors. On the finish, things only intensify. Will be at its best around 2015–2016."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,32.0,93.0,"The vineyards of the Benedictine monastery of Göttweig are now run by the Stadt Krems winemaking team. The quality is now impeccable, as this gorgeous, opulent Riesling shows. With weight and a fine balance between fruit and structure, this will age over many years."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Balthasar Ress,32.0,93.0,"There's a revitalizing freshness to this delicate auslese reminiscent of crisp green plums and yellow cherries. Silken honey and peach flavors penetrate deeply through the palate, highlighted by zesty streaks of lime and lemon. It's feather light in texture yet meanders endlessly through the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Donkey & Goat,32.0,93.0,"From a fine site farmed by Steve Matthiasson, this crisp, delightfully compelling white is tart and tangy in orange and lime. Tight and youthful, it shows complexity and concentration while a steely elegance weighs in, ultimately allowing the wine to show an elegance of site and style."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann,32.0,93.0,"Very pure notes of freshly cut, tart but ripe apples fill the nose, but there is also a slight perfume of fir forest and lemon zest. The palate is ripe and shows a dry but nonetheless lusciously ripe core, all straightened and brightened by fresh, lemony acidity. This has both balance and drama and is a joy to drink."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Ingrid Groiss,32.0,93.0,"Peppery mirabelle plums just steal the show. They dominate nose and palate and give you an extra spring in your step with their spicy zippy fillip of freshness. If you are in need of lively refreshment, look no further. This is an exemplary Grüner that expresses everything that is exemplary about the 2015 vintage."
Chardonnay,US,California,Anaba,32.0,93.0,"Components of salty toffee and honey provide a luxurious texture to this otherwise floral, nicely balanced wine, a subtle cradling of oak never in the way of its tense minerality. Green apple and Meyer lemon make appearances along the way."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Le Macchiole,32.0,93.0,"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this structured wine opens with aromas of plum, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of clove. The smooth, savory palate doles out black cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside firm, polished tannins."
Riesling,US,Washington,Pacific Rim,32.0,93.0,"This vineyard has been Demeter certified biodynamic, one of just a handful in Washington to achieve that recognition. It's all natural, ripe and full-flavored, with a wonderful, mouthfilling intensity. The flavors are a lovely mix of stone, yeast, flower and a jumble of citrus and apple fruits."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,JM Cellars,32.0,93.0,"All Milbrandt fruit has created a sappy, buttery and bright Washington Chardonnay. It bursts upon the palate with a beautiful mix of tropical fruits and caramel. Flavors are rich, persistent and lush. You want more long after the bottle has been drained."
Carignan,US,California,Ranchero Cellars,32.0,93.0,"Distinctive aromas of clove, black-cherry syrup, gingerbread cookies, allspice and nutmeg combine ripe fruit with exotic spice in a wondrous way, almost recalling women's perfume. There's a similar quality to the palate, where brown spice, dried ginger and plum fruit are embedded in a medium tannic structure and weight. It provides a fascinating take on an old, forgotten grape."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Derby,32.0,93.0,"Named for the address of the vineyard on Live Oak Road, this blend of 30% Grenache, 24% Syrah, 20% Mourvèdre, 13% Cinsault, 10% Counoise and 3% Viognier shows powerful licorice, cola, caramel, baked plum and thyme on the nose. The tannins are extremely soft on the sip, where lavish but not overripe purple flowers and black fruit compete for attention."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,32.0,93.0,"Fresh but creamy notes of ripe Conference pear on the nose mute into a peppery, herbal, yeast-savory palate with verve and freshness of utter typicity. This is textbook Grüner that offers the full and perfect package of spice, freshness and fruit on a light but concentrated body. The finish is both long and clean."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,32.0,93.0,"Hermann J. Wiemer may be synonymous with NY Riesling, but its Cabernet Francs are consistently some of the best reds made in the state. Subdued shades of cigar box, cedar and tomato leaf lend savory Old World elegance to this ripe richly concentrated wine. Pristine blackberry and plum flavors are juicy and penetrating yet briskly composed. A bristle of soft cocoa powder tannins extends the finish."
Viognier,US,California,Alysian,32.0,93.0,"A 100% varietal wine that's barrel fermented in neutral French oak, this wine is creamy and lightly tropical in guava and tangy mandarin orange. Balanced acidity and integrated oak provide buoyancy against a natural ripeness and power, finishing delightfully floral."
Syrah,US,California,Beckmen,32.0,93.0,"Rich and layered on the nose, this wine shows peppercorn, bacon fat and blackberry jam aromas. It is full and soft on the palate, with deeply rich yet still a tad tart boysenberry and elderberry fruit as well as an asphalt-driven grip."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Cameron Hughes,32.0,93.0,"An impressive effort at an attractive price, this is a full-bodied wine with an elegant edge. Floral in aroma, it luxuriates in high-toned flavors of cassis and cranberry. Soft and smooth in texture, it's graceful despite its power, and lengthy too."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sante Arcangeli,32.0,93.0,"The small 2015 vintage didn't give John Benedetti much to work with, but he sources 60% from Bald Mountain Vineyard in Bonny Doon and 40% from Split Rail in Corralitos to deliver this stunner. Aromas of Marcona almond, buttered croissant and lemon preserves lead into a palate full of acidic energy. Salty, savory flavors of roasted nuts meet with warm buttercream and fresh lemon spray on the palate. It provides a full experience."
Syrah,US,Washington,Saviah,32.0,93.0,"A blend of fruit from Watermill, Funk, Lewis and Anna Marie vineyards, the aromas bring vibrant notes of flowers, ham hock, berry, tapenade, herb and ember. The palate is plush yet elegant and silky in feel, showing an exquisite mix of fruit and savory flavors along with outrageous hang time on the finish. It shows a lot of subtlety."
Malbec,US,Washington,Waters,32.0,93.0,"This wine offers aromas of herb, tobacco, barrel spice and plum. The palate brings plush rich textured plum flavors, showing a beautiful sense of purity along with a crazy-long finish. It's a shamelessly delicious but still impeccably balanced wine that is nearly impossible to put down."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Pewsey Vale,32.0,93.0,"This release is always among my favorite Aussie Rieslings. Not only is the quality consistent, the price for a nearing-maturity wine makes it a winning value. It is smoky and toasty on the nose, showing off those developed aromas to good effect against a background of bergamot-tinged fruit. The round patina of age is balanced by great acid drive and a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Lombardy,La Perla Marco Triacca,32.0,93.0,"Vibrant, linear and complex, this dazzling red has enticing aromas of wild berry, pressed rose, graphite and a whiff of smoke. The luminous palate is all about finesse and energy, delivering tart red cherry, crushed raspberry, mineral and baking spice. Even though it has an ethereal quality, firm but extremely refined tannins and bright acidity provide structure and balance. Drink through 2026."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,32.0,93.0,"Edgy with mountainous berry flavor, Easton's 2010 Shenandoah Valley Zin is full-bodied, generous in savory spices and blackberry flavor and intoxicatingly aromatic with a peppery, leathery finish. It's structurally able to withstand many more years in bottle, so enjoy it now or give it some time. Either way, it'll shine poured alongside peppery meat."
Syrah,US,California,Melville,32.0,93.0,"Bacon fat, blackberry jam and black pepper combine for a classic and inviting nose on this bottling from the family-owned winery and winemaker Greg Brewer. The palate is dynamic with tart boysenberries, chipped dark chocolate, crushed peppercorns, a bit of char and beef tar, plus a rich mole-ancho chile element that keeps on giving."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Julia Kemper Wines,32.0,93.0,"This blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro and Jaen is a satisfying melting pot of complex flavors. Its tannins are solid, although now complementing the rich berry fruits. It is an impressive wine that could still age further before complete maturity. Drink from 2019."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Luneau-Papin,32.0,93.0,"It's an extraordinary wine that still tastes so fresh after 13 years, but for a Muscadet it's almost unbelievable. Yet, here is this citrus and white currant flavored wine that still shows high acidity and liveliness as well as a depth of texture that has come during its aging. Probably at its peak now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Navarro,32.0,93.0,"Good old Navarro is outdoing itself with the 2013 and 2014 Pinot Noirs. In this one, vivid black-cherry aromas, tangy but deep cherry and cranberry flavors, and a nice, firm and appropriately tannic texture add up to a concentrated and nicely proportioned wine. It has the flavor oomph to pair with something as big as a roast, and the tangy texture to dissolve the richest salmon."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Halcon,32.0,93.0,Mint and dill aromas turn to very concentrated and dense fruit and black-pepper flavors that unfold with extremely firm fine tannins to add a grand mouthfeel to this full-bodied wine. Time in the cellar will only improve the complexity of flavors while softening the stiff texture. Best after 2020.
Syrah,US,California,Waxwing,32.0,93.0,"This is a lovely, light-hearted yet complex 100% varietal wine that shows the beauty of a lighter touch and cooler climate. Cedar, herb and compost provide a wildness next to aromas of feral mushroom. Intriguing all the way around, this wine finishes in a burst of white pepper."
Syrah,US,California,Sol Rouge,32.0,93.0,"An unusually deep color goes right to the rim, as aromas like pomegranate and coffee emerge, and flavors like mocha, dark chocolate and blueberries follow on the palate. This young winery has a winning house style that comes through beautifully in this layered, rounded and polished wine. Best after 2018."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Volpaia,32.0,93.0,"Fragrant blue flower, plum, cake spice and a whiff of leather are some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine. Made with organically farmed Sangiovese, the juicy, delicious palate doles out ripe black cherry, fleshy blackberry, white pepper, licorice and grilled herb. It's open and well balanced, with firm, polished tannins. Drink through 2020."
Jaen,Portugal,Dão,Quinta de Lemos,32.0,93.0,"One of a series of four wines featuring the major red grapes of the Dão, this wine concentrates on the least familiar. The Jaen gives a tight, structured wine that is still firm after six years. Blackberry fruits and spice fill out the dry core and leave an impressive wine that is likely to live long. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,32.0,93.0,"The steep Monts Damnés Vineyard is one of the top sites in Sancerre. It has produced a wine that is both concentrated and aromatically fruity. It is stylish and full of acidity, with white fruits and tight structure. Ready for aging over several years."
Syrah,US,California,Waxwing,32.0,93.0,"Dense elderberry, charcoal and cracked-black-pepper aromas are lifted by lavender on the nose of this Syrah from a very coastal vineyard near Watsonville. Peppery spice and dried purple flowers make for an intense combo on the palate, where the structure is firm yet the body is relatively light and airy."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,31.0,93.0,"This is a remarkably spicy wine that is also finely balanced. It's sophisticated as well as rich, with spice and lychee flavors lifted by a crisp edge of acidity. It's complex in texture and should age well. Drink from 2015."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Saint-Rémy,31.0,93.0,"There is something sonorous but restrained about the pure ripe pear notes on the nose of this wine. The palate falls into step: Lovely, pure and resonant pear fruit gently fills nose, mouth and mind. The finish is medium sweet and sustained—a very grown up wine that treads a very fine line between Pinot Gris' inherent generosity and freshness. Totally moreish. Drink 2017–2030."
Fiano,Italy,Southern Italy,Feudi di San Gregorio,31.0,93.0,"Enticing scents of white spring flower, Spanish broom, Mediterranean herb and orchard fruit come together in the glass. On the elegant, full-bodied palate, a mineral vein underscores ripe pear, peach, candied citrus and mineral. Fresh acidity lifts the creamy flavors."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Pieropan,31.0,93.0,"Made from vines that are between 30 and 60 years old, this radiant white opens with aromas that recall white spring flower, mint and pear. The elegant, linear palate delivers concentrated flavors of juicy apple, creamy pear and zesty citrus, with firm acidity. The lingering finish closes on a mineral note."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,31.0,93.0,"Rose petal and sage notes lend a garden-green freshness to this sprightly semidry Riesling. Nervy lemon-lime flavors jolt the palate awake, but are softened by plush tones of apricot and honey. It's a squarely structured wine that's revitalizing sip after sip."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,31.0,93.0,"The vineyard around the renaissance palace of Bacalhôa was first planted with Cabernet Sauvignon in the mid-20th century. The estate continue to produce an exemplary, memorable wine. This latest release is full of tense tannins, black currant fruit and acidity and a smooth texture from the wood aging. It is a wine for holding, so drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Savannah-Chanelle,31.0,93.0,"There's a rustier rhubarb hint to this wine, made in a hillside winery between Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz. Light clove and cafe au lait round out the nose. A sip reveals warm red fruit up front, a soft and silky mouthfeel and flavors of a cinnamon cookie laced with Chinese five-spice mix."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Jean-Paul Brun,31.0,93.0,"One of an impressive range of wines by this producer from the Beaujolais crus, this wine comes from the mineral-driven flint soil of the slopes beneath the famous windmill that gives this appellation its name. It is powerful and dense, full of jammy red fruits as well as acidity and structured tannins. Drink from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Jean-Paul Picard,31.0,93.0,"Concentrated and structured, this wine needs to age. It has tight, steely acidity and a nervy, mineral texture. The apple fruits are still developing behind this intense front. It will be best from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,31.0,93.0,"The lifted nose promises purity, which the palate follows thorough on, with the gentle fruit of ripe pear and mirabelle plum and the softer freshness of ripe lemon. There is just a smattering of white pepper. All is held with great poise and freshness, and there is something utterly clean and pure about this."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,31.0,93.0,"Breathtaking scents of white peach and blossom introduce this pristinely peachy wine. It's invigoratingly fresh, laced by a gossamer fringe of sweetness and vivacious lemon-lime acidity that lingers on and on. Delicately textured yet deeply penetrating."
Kerner,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,30.0,93.0,"Heady scents of pressed jasmine, honey and candied orange waft out of the glass. The concentrated but elegant palate provides layers of mature apricot, lemon drop and ginger brightened by fresh acidity. It's vibrant and well balanced, with a persistent finish."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,30.0,93.0,"This is a medium-sweet wine that's warm and rich due to the ripening abilities of the Spiegel vineyard. It is spiced, concentrated and full of a smoky character that contrasts with its fruitiness. It's ready to drink now, although it will certainly age well. Drink until 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Nefarious,30.0,93.0,"Firm and muscular, with mixed berries and cherry fruit, this beautifully defined Cabernet shows excellent penetration and focus. The finish is long, smoky, and carries a hint of gun metal."
Merlot,US,Washington,Forgeron,30.0,93.0,"A hint of mint can be detected in the opening aromas of this Merlot, which includes a splash of Cabernet Franc in the blend. Licorice, smoke and deep cassis flavors all contribute to an intense, seductive wine, with velvety tannins enrobing a lingering finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de Fondrèche,30.0,93.0,"The name is an oblique reference to Shiraz, which forms the basis of this cuvée. It's inky in hue and rather reticent on the nose at first. But swirl it vigorously and be rewarded with layers of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Full bodied, rich and tannic, its blueberry and cassis fruit lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2015–2025."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,30.0,93.0,"Lime-zesty purity couples with an earthy, almost spicy edge. Pleasantly grippy phenolics speak of ripeness and plentitude while remaining streamlined, straight and long. This has yet to blossom but will be lovely. Drink as of 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,30.0,93.0,"Gorgeous fruit aromas, generous and deep fruit flavors and soft, chocolate accents add up to a very flavorful but relaxed wine. Touches of clove and cedar pop up with the second sip, while some welcome tannins clean the palate. The fruit flavors come back on the finish. It is full-bodied but very smooth."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Penfolds,30.0,93.0,"Named for one of Barossa's top vineyards, this blends fruit from Barossa, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Langhorne Creek into a splendid warm-climate Shiraz. It's full bodied, dense and dusty in texture, with rich dark-fruit flavors of dates, blackberries and blueberries. Hints of baking spices and mocha from the barrel-aging should integrate nicely over the next several years. Drink 2017–2025."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,30.0,93.0,"A fascinating blend of the local grape Maria Gomes and Chardonnay, this spicy, fragrant wine is full of ripe fruit notes and vibrant acidity. It remains light at heart despite all the complexity. It could be drunk now, but will be better from 2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Stack House,30.0,93.0,"This is a remarkably affordable find, so good in its red-fruited, tangy acidity and spiciness on the palate. Dried herb and pencil lie beneath bigger, bolder swathes of blackberry and cherry. This wine has a large presence but shows structure and balance."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Jean-Paul Balland,30.0,93.0,"Hints of toast from wood aging give this wine its richness. It doesn't detract from the ripe apricot and peach fruit flavors while also keeping great freshness. All the elements have produced a ripe, full wine that could still age another year. Drink from 2017."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Grand Boise,30.0,93.0,"The top rosé from old vines at Grand Boise, this is a ripe, well-structured and balanced wine. The fruit is right up front, raspberries and red plums along with a lightly herbal element. The high-altitude vineyard (up to 2,000 feet) gives a cool, crisp aftertaste to this impressive wine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Sogrape,30.0,93.0,"This wood-aged wine is a product of the new venture Sogrape has launched in Alentejo. It is powerful, dark in color and seriously concentrated. Dense tannins and a solid structure are rich with black plum and berry fruits as well as acidity. The wine is still young and needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,30.0,93.0,"This Cabernet-based wine is supremely elegant. It brings together new wood flavors, firm and dry Cabernet tannins and powerful concentration. It has great depth of flavor; very complex, the acidity promising good aging."
Friulano,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Raccaro,30.0,93.0,"Fresh, elegant and well structured, this gorgeous white offers heady aromas of spring wild flower, white stone fruit, citrus and an inviting whiff of toasted nut. It's bright and savory, delivering yellow apple, nectarine drop and almond while a saline note wraps around the lingering finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,Syncline,30.0,93.0,"Fermented 40% whole cluster in concrete cubes, this stunning wine provides intensely pure aromas of red and black fruit, flowers and herbs. The dark-fruit flavors are exquisite and fresh with an extended finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Weszeli,30.0,93.0,"Oh the purity of freshly cut red-cheeked apples illuminated by equally pure lemon freshness. Yes this is high in the acidity stakes but comes with so much purity of fruit, one simply has to rejoice in all the liveliness. This offeing has a real spring in its step and will enliven any occasion, balanced and concentrated as it is."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Couhins-Lurton,30.0,93.0,"Strong herbal aromas continue to the palate, with green fruits plus a tangy acidity that is fresh and hints of more tropical fruits to come. It's a rich wine that has great potential, so drink from 2019. This is one of several properties owned by Bordeaux vigneron André Lurton."
Chardonnay,US,California,Stephen Ross,30.0,93.0,"Mexican lime, crushed chalk, light jasmine, daffodil and lemon-lime soda show on the nose of this bottling by veteran Steve Dooley. Tight cement and lime-rind flavors pop on the palate, where a sharp kumquat quality dissects the Bosc-pear warmth and the nuanced influence of damp dill and other green herbs."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Hidalgo,30.0,93.0,"Hidalgo may be based in Sherry, but this foray into Rioja is a success. This warm-vintage wine is rich and ripe, with earthy, baked plum and blackberry aromas. A full, drawing, muscular palate along with lusty flavors of black cherry, blackberry, oak and many spices finishes full, lush and harmonious. Drink this tannic heavyweight through 2028."
Syrah,US,California,Falcone,30.0,93.0,"From a vineyard owned by veterans John and Helen Falcone in the Creston district, this expertly integrated bottling combines blackberry jam, thyme and white pepper on the elegant nose. Juicy black and purple fruits arise once sipped, riding a long line of zesty acidity and cracked black-pepper spice, alongside soy, plum sauce and roasted-beef tips."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,30.0,93.0,"Wonderfully balanced notes of green, yellow and red apples are subsumed beautifully into a taut, yeasty, autolytic strucutre. Dryness lets the fruit speak while the fizz dances woftly. This is immensely refreshing and has real grace—thanks to 95% Chardonnay and 5% Pinot Noir."
Syrah,US,California,Obsidian Ridge,30.0,93.0,"This standout wine has an extreme color that verges on black, while exciting aromas suggest wood smoke and grilled beef, with flavors so rich they could be chocolate. The wine puts those all together without becoming heavy or too stiff in texture, although it does have a flood of fine tannins that help layer in more fruit and spices as you sip. Best after 2019."
Riesling,France,Alsace,René Muré,30.0,93.0,"Golden pear and citrus fruit shimmer in the glass. The palate is ripe and fresh, made taut by citrus but glowing with ripe juicy pear and red apple. There is a lovely textured midpalate that is reminiscent of chalk, shot through with freshness that underlines the ripe fruit of 2015 even more. This is tangy and refreshing, concentrated and dry with a lovely long and whistle-clean aftertaste."
Zinfandel,US,California,High Valley Vineyard,30.0,93.0,"This wine has a distinct personality beyond the normal jammy-fruit flavors of the varietal. A fragrance like sunbaked earth and wild sagebrush meets dried cherry, dried herb and meaty flavors, supported by firm tannins and good acidity for a lip-smacking texture."
Red Blend,Austria,Wagram-Donauland,Anton Bauer,30.0,93.0,"The poised, clean and lifted wild black-cherry fruit mixed with notions of cocoa forms the aromatic theme. A very elegant wine, with medium body and alluring depth, it's currently tight and held firmly by structured, ripe tannins, while the acidity is bright and refreshing. With its youthful primary fruit, this is charming, but even a year or two will make this more pretty than it is right now."
Cabernet-Syrah,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,30.0,93.0,"With its ripe acidity, this is a wine that is ready to drink. It shows strong Cabernet Sauvignon ripeness, with a structure that is now soft and generous, along with cushioned tannins and an opulent feel. This is a wine to savor."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,30.0,93.0,"This wine is medium sweet in style with a rich, complex character. It has notes of spice and honey that accent ripe peach and apricot flavors. The richness of the wine comes from it's dense texture. It is ready to drink now, but will also age well."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Hearst Ranch,30.0,93.0,"A blueberry-balsamic reduction sauce scent kicks off this rich and opulent wine from the legendary Hearst family. It also shows smoked beef, uncracked peppercorns, black spices, vanilla bean and black coffee on the nose. The palate is lush and layered with blueberry paste, dark-chocolate fudge and Ethiopian espresso bean."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,30.0,93.0,"The near-vertical slope of the Monts Damnés produces wines that have great elegance, style and impressive richness. This 2011 is still young, needing another year to start to bring out all the complex texture and aromatics. Drink until 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Arsac,30.0,93.0,"Owned by art collector Philippe Raoux, who has filled the park of the chateau with impressive sculptures, this estate produces serious and complex wines. This latest release continues in that tradition. It is rich, structured and full of swathes of black fruit. The wine will take time, so wait until 2021."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carlisle,30.0,93.0,"This is a blend from several vineyard sites, including Banfield, Saitone, Carlisle, Montafi and Papera, each boasting more than 100-year-old vines. A chocolate cordial note dominates the palate, as bold cherry, rhubarb, cinnamon and citrus flavors wander in. It's a steal for the price, too."
White Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Remírez de Ganuza,30.0,93.0,"Lightly dusty apple and wood spice aromas are highly inviting. A layered full-size palate delivers oaky apple and salted butter-like flavors, while this Viura-Malvasia blend finishes long, smooth and steady. Drink this complex barrel-fermented wine through 2022."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Graci,30.0,93.0,"This fragrant red offers alluring scents of rose, red berry and cake spice. The radiant, structured palate is endowed with finesse, offering ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice and flinty mineral. Firm, refined tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. Drink 2020 through 2025."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Colombera & Garella,30.0,93.0,"Aromas of underbrush, rose petal, flint and dark spice waft out of the glass. The structured elegant palate offers red-cherry, raspberry, clove and star anise flavors set against fresh acidity and a firm backbone of refined tannins. Give this time to let the nervous energy calm down and you'll be rewarded with even more complexity. Drink 2020–2035."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Grey Stack,30.0,93.0,"This is a juicy, succulent and high-toned wine aged in both stainless steel and French oak. From a site rich in volcanic soils, it exudes a flinty, stony element that's incredibly compelling, accented with passionfruit and grapefruit flavors and driven by lengthy acidity."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Eder,30.0,93.0,"Initially restrained, this opens into whirls of lemon, lime and pink grapefruit peel with an almost fizzy zestiness. Refreshment travels along the palate in total precision and linearity, with a rush of citrusy excitement."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Eder,30.0,93.0,"The wine reveals savory depth that is almost soy-sauce-like, along with hints of nutmeg, white pepper and some arugula. They harmonize with ripe green pear fruit in this typically spicy white that finishes with lip-smacking and clean zest."
Viognier,US,Washington,K Vintners,30.0,93.0,"A single-vineyard wine (though not labeled as such), this was barrel-fermented in neutral French oak and bottled after about four months. Honey and toast are delicate nuances; the minerality and pure expressions of lime and kiwi fruit are at the core. This has excellent grip and medium-term aging potential."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Lustau,30.0,93.0,"Flawless on the nose, this amontillado purchased from the solera of Señor González Obregón is full of lift, power and toffee on the nose. There's zero excess weight to the palate, which features flavors of nuts, salt, caramel and dried apricot. On the finish, a hint of buttered toast offers an umami offset to acid-driven raciness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Latour-Martillac,30.0,93.0,"Tightly structured, this is a dense wine. Packed with dry tannins, it is starting life as a firm wine. It is equally rich in fruit, a panoply of black plums and red currants. Drink this concentrated wine from 2026."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Colombera & Garella,30.0,93.0,"Underbrush, mint, rosemary and wild berry aromas lead the nose and follow through to the elegantly structured palate, along with accents of white pepper and orange zest. It's young and beautifully balanced thanks to firm acidity and assertive but fine-grained tannins. A mineral note closes the lingering finish. Drink 2016–2030."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Cowhorn,30.0,93.0,"Viognier is clearly a strong suit at Cowhorn, a biodynamic vineyard and winery in the Applegate Valley of southern Oregon. The aromatic nose is wreathed in seductive scents of flower and fruit. Flavors are a mix of citrus and stone fruits, with a taste of honey that brings added depth, but not sweetness."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Tua Rita,30.0,93.0,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers aromas of blue flowers and wild berries. The firm palate delivers black cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and clove while a note of orange zest lifts up the finish. Firm, fine-grained tannins deftly support the juicy flavors. Drink 2016–2020."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château les Valentines,30.0,93.0,"Named after the year 2008, when Provence's La Londe became its own appellation, the wine is an impressive selection from specific parcels in the dry coastal slip between Toulon and Saint-Tropez. It is textured, full of ripe fruit, red berries and a squeeze of lemon juice. The wine is full bodied, rich and likely to age for a few more months. Drink from early 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Daou,30.0,93.0,"The Daou brothers have become increasingly known for their rich, unctuous and lavish high-end wines, but this bottling offers a taste of that opulence for just $30. Plump blueberry and soft, cedar-like spice scents show on the nose, while the palate bursts with black cherry, dark chocolate and caramel flavors, powered by ample acidity. It will age gracefully, but is already delicious."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Scott Paul,30.0,93.0,"Four vineyards – Ribbon Ridge, Momtazi, Maresh and Shea – are included here. Soft and seductive, this wine caresses the palate with silky fruit. Aromatically it weaves together red fruits, truffles and clean, earthy scents. It reaches just over 13% alcohol; truly Burgundian yet with an Oregon flair to the fruit flavors. It puts the lie to any notion that this was a poor vintage. Challenging to be sure, but great wines were made in 2007, and this is one of them."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Galerie,30.0,93.0,"Quiet and aromatically floral, this is a wine given time in both stainless steel and concrete, as well as a sizable percentage of neutral French oak. Lemon zest and grapefruit adorn a robust body of stony minerality and touches of spicy lemongrass."
Chardonnay,US,California,Au Bon Climat,30.0,93.0,"Jim Clendenen's winery has sat in the middle of Bien Nacido for decades, so it is no wonder he nails the vineyard's expression with this bottling, beginning with flinty and woody aromas that accent an orange custard creaminess on the nose. The palate also shows cedar-like oak, followed by waves of brioche, preserved lemon and orange marmalade flavors."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,30.0,93.0,"This is a concentrated yet delightfully light-footed elixir of fruit and flowers. Intensely perfumed, it wafts of sweet cantaloupe, honey and pollen. The palate balances lush white peach and hibiscus nectars against a scintillating backdrop of acidity. It's persistent and steely on the finish."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Colombera & Garella,30.0,93.0,"Enticing aromas of rose, white pepper, aromatic herb, crushed stone and a whiff of game float out of the glass. The elegant—almost ethereal—palate delivers ripe red cherry, crushed raspberry, truffle, clove and cinnamon. Energizing mineral notes underscores the savory flavors while fresh acidity and polished tannins provide balance and structure."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Portugal,Terras do Sado,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,30.0,93.0,"One of Portugal's oldest plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, from 1974, produced at the beautiful renaissance estate of Bacalhôa. With its dark color, elegant richness, black currant and red berry fruits, this remains a great benchmark, a brilliant transformation of the French grapes into Portuguese tastes."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Dowsett Family,30.0,93.0,"The 2008 Devotion is 41% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 29% Grenache. Winemaker Chris Dowsett notes that he is upping the percentage of Mourvèdre again in the 2009 version. It's a significant improvement, elevating this blend into a rarefied, tightly controlled, sculpted wine with wild berry and cherry, iron filings, dark chocolate and licorice, wrapped in firm, polished tannins."
Petite Sirah,US,California,San Simeon,30.0,93.0,"This is a wine for those who crave density and ripeness.

Roasted coffee and butterscotch touches lead into a long Cognac-like finish."
Red Blend,Israel,Israel,Jezreel,30.0,93.0,"Dark ruby in color, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, lavender and juniper berry. It offers pleasure from first sip through the fruit filled, smoky finish, with velvety tannins and flavors of cassis, black plum, espresso, chocolate and a hint of green pepper."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Gaudou,30.0,93.0,"Named after enologist Benjamin Cooker, this wine was aged in egg-shaped cement tanks. Pure Malbec that is rich, rounded with spice and firm tannins, it has a generous, spacious character that is beginning to develop. With a dark background to the black-currant fruits, this needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Famaey,30.0,93.0,"This is the big wine from Famaey. Bold, ripe black fruits are rich and generous in character. With a tarry backdrop and some dry tannins from wood aging, the wine is dense, generous and still young. Drink this powerful wine from 2020."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Boffa,30.0,93.0,"This elegantly structured wine opens with aromas of perfumed berry, game, leather and a whiff of cake spice.

Drink 2018–2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Alorna,30.0,93.0,"Named after the fourth Marques da Alorna, a Portuguese poet of the 18th century, this powerful wine (both in terms of the wine and the heavy bottle) is hugely dense, brooding and still very young. Its tannins dominate, giving strength to the fresh blackberry flavors under all this structure. Drink from 2018."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Frankland Estate,30.0,93.0,"This is the sort of Shiraz that forces tasters to re-examine their view of the variety as produced in Australia. It starts off with powerful aromas of cracked pepper and floral notes evocative of violets, then delivers explosively spicy flavors of pepper and licorice cushioned by ripe blackberries and a rich, supple texture. It's the best of New and Old Worlds. Drink 2010–2020 plus. Imported by USA Wine West."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,30.0,93.0,"This gorgeously inviting wine shines with barely ripe pear, lemon and lychee flavors. Its focused, stony minerality lends freshness and pleasing complexity on the palate, as orange blossom aromas and flavors seep in."
Pinot Blanc,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,30.0,93.0,"A perennially delicious version of the variety, so rare in these parts, this shines with apple, lemon, cucumber and spicy grapefruit flavors. The acidity is fresh and focused, providing tension as a taste of orange peel lingers on the palate."

Pinot Noir,US,California,Hahn,30.0,93.0,"Crystalline cranberry, concentrated violets and rose petals and a shred of cola show on the nose of this upper-level bottling from one of the appellation's longtime stars. The palate shows graphite and dried strawberry fruit amped up with woody coyote scrub elements, reflective of the chaparral that surrounds the property."
Red Blend,US,California,Derby,30.0,93.0,"This blend of 58% Petite Sirah and 42% Zinfandel provides a good example of a winery going over the top and succeeding.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Companhia das Quintas,30.0,93.0,"This is beautiful, with smooth, polished tannins and a spice note from the wood aging. It is layered with black plum, chocolate and licorice flavors, along with structure. The fruit is rich and likely to come forward in the next 3–4 years."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Montecastro,30.0,93.0,"Start packing your cellar with 2010 Ribera gems like this wine, which is offering graphite and minerally plum and berry aromas in front of a full-bodied, hard-driving palate. Ripe, extracted blackberry and lightly herbal flavors finish with tons of residual weight and tannins. This is loud, burly and delicious; drink from 2016–2030."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Wild Hogge,30.0,93.0,"Sichuan pepper and sultry mulberry aromas meet with seaweed and iodine aromas on the nose of this bottling. Deep strawberry fruit melds with black sage, licorice, mint, and slate-like minerality on the palate."

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta de Sant'Ana,30.0,93.0,"Only produced in the best years, this is a finely made wine. It has ripe, concentrated fruits that are juicy when youthful and that will develop well. Black currants and berries push through the still firm tannins bringing with them intense acidity. All these elements will allow the wine to age well. Drink from 2019."
Malbec-Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,30.0,93.0,"This wine is rich, smooth, perfumed and opulent. It shows the power of Malbec without completely losing its elegance. With generous black fruits that are round and dense, it's almost sweet in its ripeness. Conveying a dark, brooding character, this is a wine for serious aging, wait until 2018."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,La Porta di Vertine,30.0,93.0,"Concentrated and delicious, this is made with organically grown Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo and Colorino.

Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Tegernseerhof,30.0,93.0,"The nose hints at ripe fruit but it is on the palate that the wine's textured yeasty fullness becomes apparent. This is edged with the tang of grapefruit peel which encapsulates very ripe rounded fluid pear fruit on a concentrated palate. This is compact and impactful and finishes with pleasant, lip-smacking freshness."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine des Marrans,30.0,93.0,"From this old vineyard, producer Jean-Jacques Mélinand has selected the oldest vines to make this wine.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Vinho Licoroso,Global Wines,30.0,93.0,"This fortified red blend was aged in wood for 20 years.

Red Blend,Austria,Thermenregion,Gebeshuber,30.0,93.0,"Notes of crushed berries on polished mahogany come to mind. This is elegant and classic, its strucure is firm but not imposing, the tone is one of subtlety and elegance. This stands straight and presents honest, dark fruit and leaves with a long, velvety train of spiced berry, more mahogany and a touch of forest floor Very alluring."
Syrah,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Trinity Hill,30.0,93.0,"Blind, you could be forgiven for thinking this is the winery's flagship, Homage Syrah. An intoxicating nose of baking spices, blueberries and boysenberries leads to a palate with ample weight and plush tannins. It's complex, earthy and spicy, but with a beam of lively, just-ripe fruit from start to long-lived finish. Drink this stunning value through 2023."

Pinot Noir,US,California,Lumen,30.0,93.0,"This wondrously vibrant and energetic wine shows fresh-pressed raspberries and strawberries on the zesty nose alongside fennel bulb and sandalwood. The just-ripe raspberry and cherry-tomato flavors on the palate make for an intriguingly light elegance, but it's sewn together with a defined structure. Thyme and oregano herbs complete the experience."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Tegernseerhof,30.0,93.0,"Very mineral in character, this wine is named after a former priest of Dürnstein who renovated the village church. It is certainly ripe, while very textured and chalky in character, with its acidity whirling around the glass. There's great concentration as well, beautifully smoothed out by the spice and crisp apple balance. Screwcap. Artisanal Cellars, Select Wines."
Petite Sirah,US,California,High Valley Vineyard,30.0,93.0,"An stunning wine, this has enticing, complex aromas like black peppercorns, grilled beef, licorice and blackberries, with similarly layered flavors and a great sense of richness and depth. Full bodied and bold, it's packed with velvety tannins, yet finishes with elegant polish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Niepoort,30.0,93.0,"Smooth and rich, its tannins are buried in the ripe, sumptuous fruit. It's packed with red-berry, wild-strawberry and raspberry flavors, along with intense and juicy acidity. The structure does have a dry edge that promises aging, although the wine is very ready to drink now."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Gruber Röschitz,30.0,93.0,Lusciously ripe notes of apricot and honeydew melon demand attention. The palate is more toned down but has dimensions of peppery arugula and lovage leaves. The finish is long and savory with a citrus kick.
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Davis Family,30.0,93.0,"This blend of 48% Roussanne, 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier is delightfully drinkable, viscous and fresh in steely acidity. With beautifully potent floral aromas, it shines in focused pear and apricot flavors."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,30.0,93.0,"This is a limited production wine—a selection of the winemakers. It is still very young, structured and rich.

Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Pierre-Bise,30.0,93.0,"The wine is a blend of wines made by three highly reputed local growers, Vincent Ogereau, Yves Guégniard and Claude Papin, who all own vines in this walled vineyard. The result is a wine that is a distillation of the minerality and richness of Savennières. It is dry although it has just a touch of honey as well as spicy almond and pineapple fruit flavors. The wine should age, so drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sineann,30.0,93.0,"This is a reserve-level bottling, from Yates Conwill fruit, made in half bottles only. Dark, dense and concentrated, it shows hints of raisining in the nose, yet is a balanced and potent wine anchored in superb black cherry fruit. Enjoy it now and through 2021."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,La Prevostura,30.0,93.0,"Perfumed berry, dark spice, dried herb, a hint of tar and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this striking red.

This is made for lengthy cellaring so give it ample time to fully develop into the dazzling wine it promises to become. Drink 2021–2036."
Grenache,US,Washington,Two Vintners,30.0,93.0,"This vineyard is best known for its Syrah but Grenache also shines, as evidenced by this compelling bottle. The aromas pop with complex notes of flowers, brown stems, mineral, smoke, raspberries, peppery spice and the vineyard's signature earthy funk. The palate shows delicacy, precision and detail, with a lightly meaty, peppery finish that lingers. It's a completely captivating expression of the variety with balance that downright dazzles."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Hazyblur,30.0,93.0,"The quality of the wine emerging from this producer located off the coast of South Australia continues to impress. This is a big, brash Shiraz, screaming with vanilla and mixed berry flavors, yet the result is some kind of harmony, even with the volume turned up to 11. It's full bodied and plushly textured, with a long, layered finish. Delicious now and over the five years or more."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Pinto,30.0,93.0,"This blend of Touriga Nacional and Castelão has produced an impressive wine that is packed with rich tannins and a dark brooding structure. Intense acidity cuts through the rich, powerful texture to give a fresh aftertaste. It is still young, so drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Laporte,30.0,93.0,"Produced on silex and flint soil, this is fruity, juicy and lemon-flavored wine. There is a strong mineral element here, giving a crisp texture. It's really the perfumed character and the intense fruit that sets this wine apart. It is ready to drink if you like fruit, although it will be better as the fabulous texture kicks in, so wait until 2017."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Biecher & Schaal,30.0,93.0,"Both ripe pear and ripe, yellow apple shine on nose and palate. On a slender body they are even more highlighted by pure, clean lemon freshness and the dry style. There is a stony backdrop and immense brightness. This is friendly and pure, light but long lasting, like an open, happy smile."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kitá,30.0,93.0,"A very light straw in color, this bottling by winemaker Tara Gomez shows freshly cut brown pear, delicate citrus and fresh apple blossom aromas on an inviting, tightly hewn nose. An extremely grippy texture claims the palate, where flavors of tangerine rinds, lemon pith and a tense chalkiness converge for a classic wine with long cellar life."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Petit Métris,30.0,93.0,"While the wine is dry, it has such a wonderful honey character. It is perfumed, ripe and rich with almonds, pear and baked apple flavors. The wine, from a single vineyard, is likely to develop much further. Wait to drink until 2019."
Syrah,US,Washington,Syncline,30.0,93.0,"A dark, smoky, earthy Syrah with juicy blackberry and black currant fruits. This wine just coats the palate and seduces; threads of coffee and caramel, baking spices and cinnamon all weave through the lengthy finish. The tannins are supportive but unobtrusive, and the balance is superb. It finishes with a burst of grilled meat."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Loïc Mahe,30.0,93.0,"With its honeyed character, this wine seems initially sweet. Then the crisp acidity and mineral texture come to the fore to give a well-balanced wine. Produced from biodynamically grown grapes, the wine is deliciously crisp, with apple fruitiness and a flinty structure. Drink now, although the wine will age well until 2023."
Zinfandel,US,California,Trinitas,30.0,93.0,"Hefty, spicy aromas like black pepper, cardamom and wood smoke are followed by ripe, almost thick sensations of blackberry, blueberry and dried black fig. The mouthfeel of this wine is broad and soothing, the body extra full, and the finish lingers nicely."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Biecher & Schaal,30.0,93.0,"Very earthy notes precede a subdued nose of citrus zest. These tart but expressive notes open up a little more on the palate where they are joined by a rounded, if crunchy structure. There is ample freshness here but also an earthy and (for now) citrus-fruited generosity. The finish reverts to stony, earthy cleanness. This is intriguing and needs time to unfold its fruit and unusual texture. Drink 2020–2030"
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Saint-Rémy,30.0,93.0,"A very pure but subtle note of Golden Delicious apple hits the nose. The palate rounds out this ripe but tart flavor but also brightens it with lovely apple crispness and freshness. The body is dry and totally fresh with wonderful concentration, aromatic length and purity. This simply leaves you wanting more."
Chardonnay,Canada,British Columbia,CedarCreek,30.0,93.0,"Fragrant, with a floral lift in the nose, this is loaded with rich fruit flavors of pineapple, peach and citrus. A whiff of toast and just-sawn wood leads into a lengthy, beautifully balanced, tongue-coating finish."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Huët,30.0,93.0,"A wine with a very mineral character, some weight, very lively acidity, rounded out with spice and pear. This is for long-term aging, over five years and more."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Aubichon Cellars,30.0,93.0,"Distinctive, artisanal and sourced from a spectacular site, this was fermented in oak and barrel aged. The hock bottle indicates the Alsatian style, and the wine inside is both powerful and  sturdy, with supple, generous flavors of stone fruits running into light tropicality."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lincourt,30.0,93.0,"Light but inviting wood aromas from oak to acacia show on the nose of this bottling, along with red-pear skins, yellow-grapefruit pith and the slightest touch of marshmallow. The sip is more about chalky grip and the tightly woven texture than blunt flavors, with enough sour Key-lime and pink-grapefruit touches to entertain the palate."
Chardonnay,US,California,Baileyana,30.0,93.0,"The nose on this wine by Burgundy-raised veteran vintner Christian Roguenant is very minerally and focused, showing chalk, crushed sea shells, lemon rind and a touch of Marcona almond. The texture is pleasantly grippy and taut, containing flavors of white peach, grapefruit pith and baking soda, all of which sail deep into the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Foley,30.0,93.0,"Light on the nose, this shows delicate aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle, squeezed lemon wedge, fresh coconut flesh and a tiny bit of butter. The palate is also demure yet delicious, with lightly poached apples, squeezed lime and a chalky textural grip."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Te Mata,30.0,93.0,"This has come to epitomize the Hawke's Bay style of Sauvignon Blanc, typical in it's ripe fruit and oak treatment. Hints of vanilla and cedar frame passion fruit and pink grapefruit notes, then leave a lingering impression of Creamsicle behind on the silky-textured finish."
Merlot,US,Washington,Forgeron,30.0,93.0,"An A+ trio of vineyards—Olsen, Stonetree and Boushey—contribute equally to this pure Merlot. In a Forgeron portfolio that regularly shines with a variety of red wines, Merlot is usually the best of show, as it is here. Tight, tart and perfectly proportioned, this at first offers scents and accents of sweet tomato paste and a whiff of oregano, then opens further with lush cherry flavors and a dash of dried tobacco. Merlot and pasta? Why not?"
Grenache,US,California,Koehler,30.0,93.0,"Juicy strawberry and red plum aromas meet cinnamon, sassafras and earthy scents in this bottling from winemaker Colin Murphy. Beautiful layers of sour cherry combine with dried fennel, wild mint, thyme and rose petal flavors on the palate, which finishes clean and crisp."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Myka,30.0,93.0,"An impressive, cool-climate take on a Rhône blend, this mix of 60% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 15% Mourvèdre shows fresh boysenberry, black pepper, crushed lavender and potpourri on the fresh nose. Lots of lively energy lands on the palate, where more pepper and purple fruits are enhanced by dried fennel, crushed marjoram, tarragon and layers of sharp yet savory flavor."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,30.0,93.0,"Exotically floral and spicy, this delivers an intoxicating blend of exuberance and elegance. While delicately framed, the palate is rich, ripe and juicy, with sweet yellow-cherry and apricot flavors, and a slick of wax and honey. It's brisk and nervy, yet finishes remarkably long, with a swathe of green herbal tones."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Bernard Baudry,30.0,93.0,"A chalk soil vineyard gives this very mineral interpretation of Loire Cabernet Franc. It has richness, weight, solid, ageworthy tannins as well as juicy red fruits. Dried fruits and just a hint of herbal acidity add complexity to a wine that is still young. Age for 5–6 years."
Chardonnay,Canada,British Columbia,Burrowing Owl,30.0,93.0,"Starting with the package, this comes in a lovely, graceful, goosenecked bottle. The wine is equally svelte, buttery and flat-out yummy, a silky, creamy blend of apple, pear, nut butter and caramel. The length, texture and integration of the barrel and fruit flavors make this extra special."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Cowhorn,30.0,93.0,"This small, family-owned, biodynamically farmed vineyard and winery is quickly becoming a southern Oregon cult producer. Certainly one of the finest Viogniers produced anywhere in the Northwest, this extraordinarily aromatic wine showers the palate with luscious and tangy lemon, pineapple, Satsuma orange and pear fruit flavors. Then the spices pile on, lending an exotic twist to a lengthy midpalate, and leading into a lightly toasty finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Lieubeau,30.0,93.0,"From the cru village of Château Thébaud, this wine with its five years of aging has reached a happy peak maturity. Perfumed and rounded, its fruit has changed into almonds and spice while keeping a strongly mineral texture. It is a fine wine that is ready to drink now."
Merlot,US,Washington,Januik,30.0,93.0,"Iron and steel, rock and earth are the first things you notice about this mineral-inflected, single-vineyard Merlot. It's an ode to tannin and terroir, a tough, tight and dense wine with primary fruit flavors of cranberry and cassis."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,El Enemigo,30.0,93.0,"With an opaque purple tint and super-concentrated aromas of blackberry and violet petals, this is an in-your-face Malbec that pulls no punches. The “Enemy,” which is really your friend, pushes blackberry, licorice, chocolate and floral flavors on a frame that expands as it airs out. Drink now through 2019."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Alain Brumont,30.0,93.0,"The wine is impressive and packed with dense dark fruits. It comes from the showpiece estate of Madiran that was created by the iconic producer of the region, Alain Brumont. If this wine wasn't quite so intense, so overpowering and so alcoholic, it would be very great indeed. As it is, it will surely age and should not be drunk until 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Diora,30.0,93.0,"Designed by Delicato winemaker James Ewart as a Pinot with power that can handle a steak, this wine features a dense, dark nose, with blackberry, olallieberry and red currant cut by allspice, clove and licorice-vanilla cookies. The palate is rich and luxurious, with ripe cranberry and red-cherry elements spiced up with mocha, cappuccino and long-lingering vanilla bean. It's boisterous and fresh, so drink now with a juicy rib-eye."
Grüner Veltliner,US,California,Solminer,30.0,93.0,"This wine's excellently layered yet light nose mixes pomelo skin with tangelo and lime-spritzed pink-apple notes. The palate is extremely nervy, with grippy lemon-skin texture and squeezed-citrus flavors, all balanced by riper apple. It's like biting into a cold, crisp, just-ripe pear or nectarine."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Graci,30.0,93.0,"Made with 70% Carricante and 30% Catarratto, this elegantly structured wine has enticing aromas of Mediterranean herb, fragrant yellow flower, citrus and a whiff of acacia. The fresh, savory palate shows juicy lime, ripe pear, chopped herb and mineral alongside tangy acidity. The lingering finish closes crisp and clean."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Jean-Luc Baldès,30.0,93.0,"With its firm, black fruits, this is a very chunky wine, mineral in character. It has tension, with tannins layered with intense flavors, very structured. It needs aging. One of a series of single-vineyard wines created by Jean-Luc Baldès."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Dão,Global Wines,30.0,93.0,"The Casa de Santar estate, still inhabited by its aristocratic owners, is run by Global Wines. From one parcel, Vinha dos Amores, they have produced this impressively ripe wine with its dense tannins. Full of spice, black plum skin texture and balanced acidity, it's serious, concentrated and only just mature. Drink now or cellar until 2028."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta Dona Matilde,30.0,93.0,"A strict selection of grapes, this wood aged, foot-trodden wine has a rich, generous character. While the tannins are firm and concentrated, the plummy fruit is equally so. Together, they yield a powerful, dark wine that will still age further. Drink from 2018."
Malbec,US,California,Opaque,30.0,93.0,"Boysenberries and olallieberries explode on the nose of this bottling by the ever-adventurous Riboli family, bolstered by dried tarragon and turned earth. It is wondrously smooth and silky on the sip, with rising blueberry fruit and tons of depth, offering dried sage and other roasting herbs as well as dark chocolate and espresso flavors."
Carricante,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Vivera,30.0,93.0,"Enticing aromas of crushed stone, acacia flower, citrus and sea breeze lift out of the glass. The elegant, medium-bodied palate offers ripe yellow apple, mineral, dried herb and honey alongside well-integrated acidity. A note of candied citrus zest gives it a succulent but focused finish."
Malbec,US,California,Tooth and Nail,30.0,93.0,"One of the better Malbec-based wines of the region, this fairly priced blend, which includes 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Syrah, offers a dense core of blackberry jam that's covered by layers of loam, charred beef, black pepper and smoke. The dense black-cherry and blueberry flavors are cut by intense pepper, vanilla bean and prominent cappuccino, all frame by woody tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Alder Ridge,30.0,93.0,"Young, supple and stylish, this mixes notes of berry, plum and cassis, demonstrating poise and richness. The barrel flavors are smoothly integrated; the finish is rich and dark, with a strong streak of cacao."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Obsidian Ridge,30.0,93.0,"Bold aromas, thick layers of fruit flavor, and a supple but steely texture of fine tannins and acidity add up to a powerful and complex wine that should improve with age. Pure, dark-fruit flavors are accented by smoke and cardamom while the structure is mouthpuckering with astringency but softened by the richness of body and fruit. Best after 2019."
Syrah,US,California,Obsidian Ridge,30.0,93.0,"This extremely flavorful but young and tightly wound wine has black pepper, dark chocolate and smoke aromas, concentrated blackberry and cassis flavors, firm tannins and full body. This is a powerful, full-bodied, firmly structured wine that needs time to show its best side. It should drink beautifully after 2018."
Petit Verdot,US,California,Opaque,30.0,93.0,"There is a great amount of dark strawberry freshness on the nose of this intriguing and seductive bottling, enhanced by gravel, pepper and a distinctive mintiness. Peppercorns, beef char and smoke hit the palate alongside blueberry and boysenberry, with plum-skin tartness and firm tannins ensuring ageability."
Merlot,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,30.0,93.0,"From a vineyard situated in a forested area of northern Tejo comes this is a structured version of Merlot. It is ripe and rich with black fruits, as well as dark tannins and firm concentration. It could benefit from further aging, so drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Domaine Eden,30.0,93.0,"Extremely refreshing and lovely on the nose, this slightly lower-priced bottling from the Mount Eden team shows nectarine, crisp pluot, cherimoya flesh and the lightest hint of Key-lime zest on the nose. The structure on the sip is intense, with stony crushed-concrete elements and flavors of lime rind, cold Gala apple and gunmetal."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Two Vintners,30.0,93.0,"This wine is 70% Syrah and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, with fruit coming from Yellow Jacket, Stoney Vine and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Aromas of herb, ember, black cherry, earth, smoked meat and plum are followed by palate-coating, rich fruit and savory flavors, with enough tannic structure to benefit from some time in the cellar."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Monteraponi,30.0,93.0,"Red berry, wild cherry, earthy underbrush, tobacco and clove are just some of the aromas and flavors you'll find on this vibrant, elegant blend of organically farmed Sangiovese (95%) and Canaiolo. Fermented with wild yeasts, it combines finesse and sheer drinking pleasure."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,Dönnhoff,30.0,93.0,"White flowers and lime skins juxtapose smoke and slate on the nose of this ethereal kabinett. Delicately sweet, as if gilded by hibiscus nectar, it fills the palate with waves of sunny yellow-stone fruit and tart lemons. A lovely wine that should show its youthful effervescence through 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Rulo,30.0,93.0,"Sourced from the Clifton Hill vineyard, this is a supple and fruity Syrah, with exceptional depth of flavor. A mix of tart cherry and plum fruit, it's annotated with notes of graphite, ash, tobacco and dark chocolate."
Merlot,US,Washington,Seven Hills,30.0,93.0,"Estate grown and skillfully made, blended with 9% Cabernet Franc, this captivates with its sophistication and elegance. The Cabernet Franc brings some floral highlights to the nose, while the sturdy Merlot—dressed in accents of incense and sandalwood, cocoa and cinnamon—powers its way through a marvelously long finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,30.0,93.0,"A very subtle nose gives a mere glimpse of lemon zest, the palate delivers a thrillingly pure and exquisitely honest flavor that suggests clear mountain lakes and clean Alpine air. This is bracing and fresh, delicate and lemon-scented from the first sniff to the last echoing aftertaste. This could be dangerously addictive with its concentrated but ultraslender features."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,Gini,29.0,93.0,"Year in year out, this wine is always one of the best Soaves and the 2013 is no exception. Elegant and impeccably balanced with vibrant acidity, it delivers crisp yellow apple, Bartlett pear, creamy white peach, almond and lemon zest sensations. Notes of saline and energizing mineral close the lingering finish. Drink through 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Wolff,29.0,93.0,"Bright and ready-to-burst flavors of raspberry and just-ripe cranberry show on the nose of this bottling that also features tartness and graphite minerality alongside vanilla and baking spice. More of an underripe character shows on the forest-floor palate, where thyme and marjoram mix with tangy red fruit, pine needle and juniper."
Pinot Gris,Austria,Burgenland,Meinklang,29.0,93.0,"Gorgeously lifted rich notes of orange zest fill the nose of this beautiful “orange” wine. Fermented on skins, it has all the elegance of white wine, combined with the tannic structure and backbone of red. Made from pink Pinot Gris grapes, this lends itself beautifully to this treatment and leaves us with an intriguing, concentrated, fresh and whistle-clean wine of great expression. Savor its salty orange-scented length."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Willm,29.0,93.0,"A funky smoky notion of yeast clings to the nose on which a pure lemon streak becomes apparent. A generous, luscious and almost creamy sweetness then conquers the palate, boosting all of the fruit flavors, wrapping them in its creamy mellow embrace. The pure lemon streak counters and brightens the richness and around the edges there is grapefruit spice. This is all rather beguiling but not overdone. The finish is moreish, medium sweet and long."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Pfister,29.0,93.0,"The nose is a mere promise compared to the full-on experience that follows. The dry palate is a lovely synthesis of ripe, textured and tart elements: of russet-pear peel and flesh, of grapefruit zestiness and spice, of ripe and aromatic tangerine. This is concentrated and full of flavor, animated and full of impact. This seems like energizing fuel. Mouthwatering freshness creates a long fruit-rich driven finish."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,29.0,93.0,"Orange blossom and lemon zest perfume this intensely aromatic dry Riesling. Plump yellow cherry and tangerine flavors build on the palate, invigorated by racy zips of acidity and crushed-stone minerality. Buoyantly pretty yet firmly structured to improve at least another decade."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,"Bodegas Toro Albala, SL",29.0,93.0,"Ultra concentrated and sticky, with unctuous but wholesome raisin aromas taken to a level that's almost heavenly. In the mouth, the maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors are lusty and satisfying, and the finish never ends. This is P.X. in awesome form."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Beresan,29.0,93.0,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from the Yellow Jacket, Waliser and Pepper Bridge vineyards, this supremely rich and expressive wine is riveting for its depth and detail, and it's packed with red, blue and black fruits. Whiffs of smoke, graphite and stone add complexity, and the hint of bitter chocolate in the finish is the capper."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Hirsch,29.0,93.0,"Sipping this recalls biting into a ripe, sharp and crisp Cox Orange Pippin apple: juiciness, freshness and crunchy texture. With time, fresh orange peel joins the aromatic fray, while the palate stays exquisitely fresh and totally balanced. This is utterly appetizing and moreish with lots of verve and bouncy joy. A super-clean finish."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Nino Franco,29.0,93.0,"This dazzling sparkler opens with enticing aromas of wisteria, spring wild flowers, vineyard dust and freshly picked orchard fruit. The crisp, linear palate doles out green apple, nectarine, pear and energizing mineral notes alongside a creamy perlage and vibrant acidity. It's perfectly balanced and refreshing."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta dos Roques,29.0,93.0,"Intense and concentrated, full of fruit, tannic structure and richness. It comes from a fine vintage and shows the ripe fruit, rich berry and red plum character, along with a more austere, ageworthy edge. A very fine wine, and one worth keeping for 5–6 years."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,29.0,93.0,"Utterly glowing notes of pear already point towards richness. Notes of smoke and nuttiness prevent them from appearing facile. The palate rings with the same fruity glow and introduces soft, pliable sweetness. Earthy elements echo here and there from the concentrated, focused palate. This certainly leaves a mark and finishes almost dry."
Syrah,US,California,Novy,29.0,93.0,"This appellation blend performs as well as the single-vineyard expressions by the same vintner (at least early in the wine's life). From Adam Lee, this bottling offers fresh blackberry, violet, lilac, lavender, charcoal, beef and white pepper on the nose. The palate is full of peppery, boysenberry-juice flavors, wrapped in an engaging texture."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,DanCin,29.0,93.0,"Ripe and luscious, this coats the mouth with a mélange of juicy apples and peaches. That initial hit is followed up with a wash of buttery, toasted nuts, and finally kissed away with a lick of wet stone. It's creamy and rich without ever being tiring."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Matello,29.0,93.0,"This is a lovely wine, with flavors both rich and racy—cool minerality meets ripe lemon/lime, with a dollop of creamy custard. It's mouthfilling and smooth, with lingering, delicious flavors that resonate beautifully."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Sagrado,29.0,93.0,"Fermented in open stone lagars, this wine has the typical opulent structure that comes from this time-honored technique. With its dark tannins and concentrated black fruits, this wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional, is ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Windy Oaks,29.0,93.0,"Slightly cloudy with a lighter, cranberry juice color, this multi-layered wine begins with a nose of strawberry, pomegranate and black cardamom. It is deliciously refreshing on the palate, with rounded tomato and smashed berries dancing with eucalyptus and bay leaf, providing fruit-meets-spice excellence."
Chardonnay,US,California,Iron Horse,29.0,93.0,"This estate Chardonnay is keeping stylistically with the winery's other offerings, though a tad weightier and richer in oak and crème brûlée. Fresh peach, pineapple and anise intermingle on the palate, with a silky yet complex texture. There is a palate-refreshing hint of lime on the finish."
Nero d'Avola,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Curto,29.0,93.0,"A medley of pretty aromas, including blue flower, perfumed berry, carob and Mediterranean herb all mingle in the glass. On the smooth, almost creamy palate, savory notes of clove, orange zest, white pepper and licorice add depth to the juicy blackberry core, while polished tannins provide the framework."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Nino Franco,29.0,93.0,"Citrus, apple, crushed herb and wild flower aromas take center stage on this elegant sparkler. It's bright and silky, with savory Bartlett pear, nectarine zest and hints of thyme balanced by a creamy mousse and vibrant acidity. Thanks to its depth of flavors, finesse and crisp dry finish, it beautifully demonstrates Prosecco's serious side."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Pali,29.0,93.0,"One of the more fairly priced blends from the appellation on the market, this mix of Bentrock, Radian, Rancho La Vina and Huber vineyards shows black cardamom, chai spice, lemon oil, eucalyptus and concentrated, aromatic black raspberries on the nose. Once sipped, flavors of sour cherry meet with juniper and pine herbals."
Grenache,US,California,Inspiration,29.0,93.0,"Sourced from Ceja Vineyards, this wine impresses in crisp dried red fruit and perfumed floral aromatics that go on for days. Velvety in texture and robust in power, it offers big shoulders around a tartness of acidity and complex baking spice."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Campolargo,29.0,93.0,"This is a big, perfumed wine. It is still young, with new wood flavors, touches of eucalyptus and dense, dry tannins. To balance all this structure, the ripe and juicy berry flavors give the wine the richness it needs. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,29.0,93.0,"A superstar in this new vintage, this wonderfully concentrated and well-delineated wine offers precise fruit flavors of etched and sculpted peach, apricot and melon in perfect proportion. There is ample acidity under the 19 g/l residual sugar."
Syrah,US,California,William James,29.0,93.0,"Jumping out of the glass with intoxicating aromas of cracked cherry cordials, this wine comes from the small production of Robin Bogue, whose father, Bill Bogue, is a well-known vineyard consultant. Flavors start with grilled meatiness, slowly slip to licorice on the midpalate and finish between vanilla and leather. Altogether a richly nuanced and deeply luscious wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Western Australia,Xanadu,29.0,93.0,"This paints a true picture of Margaret River in its sage and bay leaf shadings and concentrated cassis fruit. It's all framed by hints of vanilla and toasty oak, but the emphasis remains on dried herbs and fruit through the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2030."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ebner-Ebenauer,29.0,93.0,"Fresh and spicy form the first impression: ripe pear and moss, stone fruit and yeast combine to create an inviting, rounded and rich sensation. The palate adds the requisite freshness and surprises with wonderful concentration. Yellow plum and juicy pear shimmer, always edged with savory yeast. Tons of character and great length are present, and yet demonstrate no heaviness at all. What a lovely but honest wine!"
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Franco M. Martinetti,29.0,93.0,"Enticing aromas of violet, dark berry, leather and sweet baking spices lead the way on this vibrant, delicious red. The lively, polished palate doles out juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and clove framed in bright acidity and supple tannins. It boasts elegance and balance."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Irvine Family Vineyards,29.0,93.0,"This wine explodes with a glorious mix of buttered nuts, toast, ripe yellow fruits and supporting acidity. The exceptional length proposes at least a decade of development ahead. Drink now through 2025."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Eisenberg,Jalits,29.0,93.0,"A hint of black, intense elderberry steals away almost as soon as it appears. Intriguing blueberry and plum remain on a slender, supple and lissom palate that is dense and toned. There is focus, concentration and purity, framed by stony notes, smoky oak and great freshness. This will take time to relax, so drink 2018–2025."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Lagler,29.0,93.0,"Very ripe yellow plum, immediately tempered by zesty grapefruit, is the chief notion on the nose. The palate seems softer and even has a smoky note. Slender and mineral, this is toned and light-footed. The layered palate pulls to mind very stony soils. Beautiful now but will get even better—if you can wait at all. Drink as of 2017."
Spätburgunder,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,29.0,93.0,"Luscious ripples of blackberry and plum contrast savory swathes of herb and bramble throughout this richly textured Spätburgunder. While full bodied and densely concentrated, it's balanced elegantly by a strike of cranberry acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drinks well now but structured enough to improve through 2020."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,29.0,93.0,"Ripe mandarin with tender touches of white blossom beckons invitingly on the nose. The palate is precise, toned and sprightly. This wine dances nimbly on the palate, touching here with tangerine, there with lemon. Spicy zestiness lasts and lasts."
Mourvèdre,France,Provence,La Bastide Blanche,29.0,93.0,"This dark-hued wine is still very closed and firm. Dark chocolate and licorice flavors are prominent against a backdrop of black fruit, hinting at the wine's considerable wood aging. It does have great weight and richness, so let it develop and drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kessler-Haak,29.0,93.0,"There's a complex blend of oak, citrus and butter on the nose of this wine, like a sourdough roll cooked over a campfire and then topped with lemon marmalade. The well-balanced palate further blends the experience, with smoke and vanilla coalescing around Mexican lime and yellow apple, culminating in a finish redolent with hard butterscotch candies."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Contucci,29.0,93.0,"Earthy aromas of blue flowers, game, tilled soil, red berry and leather come together in the glass. The elegant palate offers juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and savory herb, while a backbone of firm but fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity provides an age-worthy structure. It's still a bit austere, but will blossom into a beauty over the next several years. Drink 2016–2025."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Baron de l'Ecluse,29.0,93.0,"From a parcel on this 12-acre estate, the wine is structured and rich. It has layers of firm tannins under the black fruits. Acidity and a crisp mineral texture mix with the solid structure and concentration. The aftertaste shows the generous future of this fine cru wine. Drink from 2018."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château Jolys,29.0,93.0,"Apricot and mango aromas give this wine an immediate opulence. It is ripe and honeyed although with the enormous, age-worthy acidity and flavors of pineapple and passion fruit. The wine is still so young and should not be drunk before 2019."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Richard Rottiers,29.0,93.0,"The producer has several parcels in Moulin-à-Vent which go into this blend. It is a firm and structured wine at this stage: dense and with both spice and black fruits. It is obviously made for some long aging, so don't drink this serious wine before 2019."
Chardonnay,France,Alsace,Boeckel,29.0,93.0,"Notes of chalk, bread and stone precede the bruised apple notes on this beautiful, elegant vintage Crémant. On the palate, the apple notes become fuller and rounder and appear like mellow, baked Golden Delicious. There is purity, structure and precision in the autolytic notes which are supported by pure citrus and apple freshness, leaving the palate impressed but not weighed down. Hints of spice develop in the background while all the freshness makes for a lip-smacking, long and savory finish."
Welschriesling,Austria,Burgenland,Rosenhof,29.0,93.0,"Despite its pale, white color this Ausbruch emanates notes of dried Medjool dates and dark raisins. Currant and golden sultana also get their due. Brighter sweetness illuminates the poised palate that is lit up with fresh acidity. All the while the rich, sweet, sumptuous and dark caramel notes provide a sonorous background. Evidence to what giddy heights a Welschriesling (not related to Riesling) can rise. The finish comes with a satisfying fillip of apricots. This is unusual and should spur the curiosity of sweet wine lovers."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,René Muré,29.0,93.0,"Red-cheeked apple peel and freshly-cut apple tart on the nose make for an irresistible opening. There is a bright, lemony streak of acidity at the core, cushioned by soft mousse and a soft background of yeasty autolysis. This is slender, taut and refreshing, with a completely satisfying chalky, stony background."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,29.0,93.0,"A rich concentrated wine that is solid with tannins and ripe with black fruits. The fruits are up front with the densely tannic character equally prominent. With spice, bitter coffee as well as fine berry fruits, the wine is still young. Drink from 2019."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Ruby Hill Winery,29.0,93.0,"It's difficult to tame the harsh tannins of this variety, but the Ruby Hill winemaker did it. The result is a flavorful, firm-textured wine that's also complex in flavor and well-balanced overall. It's tempting to drink now with a dry-aged steak, but it will be best after 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Oso Libre,29.0,93.0,"There is a density and unity of dark fruit on the nose of this wine, with black currant, boysenberry and dried mint aromas showing strong. It's a study of structure on the palate, with more bright black fruit as well as dark chocolate, cedar and espresso elements that will continue to soften with age. Drink 2017–2025."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Ruby Hill Winery,29.0,93.0,"This engaging, multilayered, flavorful and nuanced wine has subtle aromas like black pepper and grilled meat. Flavors suggest ripe Bing cherries and blackberries, while the seductive mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Aged 20 months in American oak barrels, the wine has great structure and will improve through at least 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,28.0,93.0,"This estate whose name means four winds is in the Douro Superior, the easternmost part of the Douro region. It is intensely rich and solid—a classic blend for the region with a dominance of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, aged in wood and with plenty more aging ability. This black-fruit-flavored wine will be best from 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Dunham,28.0,93.0,"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Pinto,28.0,93.0,"This is a strong, firm wine with an initially earthy aroma that fills out with the scent of dark black fruits. The structure of the wine is taut, dark and brooding, offering serious potential for aging. Its bold acidity and young tannins further suggest aging, so drink between 2016–2024. Langdon Shiverick, Comète Wines."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Arndorfer,28.0,93.0,"Hints of lemon peel rise shyly from the glass, becoming more intense with air. The palate is dry, buffered and has a savory undertow of wild thyme that interplays beautifully with sumptuous peach notes and that almost textured, zesty acidity that unites everything and brings extended, refreshing length."
Chardonnay,US,California,Parker,28.0,93.0,"Plump tangerine, pink grapefruit and warmer tones of Gala apples show on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard that's slightly northwest of the Sta. Rita Hills appellation. Rounder nectarine and apple flavors show on the sip that fattens up in the midpalate with poached Asian pear and popcorn, deftly leveled throughout with a zesty lemon-wedge touch."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rossi Wallace,28.0,93.0,"Made by Ric Forman from Zin grown on the Nichelini Vineyard in Chiles Valley and Sangiovese from the Antinori family's Antica Vineyard on Atlas Peak, this wine is rich and dense in red fruit that's layered and ripe. Aged for a year in used Burgundy barrels, it retains juicy freshness and elegance, with subtle touches of vanilla and baking spice."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Dopff Au Moulin,28.0,93.0,"A lick of lemon tanginess plays on the nose alongside a touch of peach. The palate reprises this lemon freshness and lets it dance softly on the fluid, dry palate. Peach and mirabelle can be glimpsed, too. This is dry and fresh, clean and vivid, leaving the palate cleansed and refreshed. The lemon echoes long, joined by zesty grapefruit on the finish, and makes this totally moreish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Morgan,28.0,93.0,"An amazing wine for less than $30, this bottling by veteran Winemaker Dan Lee starts with tightly wound aromas of dried yogurt, Meyer lemon peel, honeysuckle and Asian-pear flesh. Great grapefruit-pith flavors kick off the sip, where lime juice and baking soda combine for a tight, bright, grippy, laser-focused and high-toned palate."
Syrah,US,California,Mercy,28.0,93.0,"Ripe and plump blackberries shine through in a showcase of fruit purity, lifted by dried fennel, hot black gravel, peppercorns, toasted sesame and soy. There is tremendous structure and acidity on the sip, with black pepper and black-sesame nuance plus juicy boysenberry character to the midpalate."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Fattorie Romeo del Castello,28.0,93.0,"Dark-skinned berry, new leather, aromatic herb and a whiff of cake spice lead the nose. Delicious and approachable, the smooth, full-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and clove alongside supple tannins and vibrant acidity."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Chesebro,28.0,93.0,"This blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre grown on the Chesebro family property indeed reflects the wild mountains, with aromas of black pepper, white pepper, lilac, wisteria, lavender oil, elderberry, cola and Dr Pepper on the lively nose. Root beer pops on the palate along with boysenberry, charcoal, tar and black pepper. It's vibrant and delicious."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Gustafson Family,28.0,93.0,"This is a pretty wine, vibrant in white pepper and braised meat. The nose is pure violet and blueberry, while the approach to the fruit is light-handed, with integrated tannins and a low oak imprint. Entirely varietal, it delves into earthy territory with elements of forest floor and dark chocolate."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Adega Mãe,28.0,93.0,"With winemakers Anselmo Mendes and Diogo Lopes, there is a good pedigree to this wine. It shows in the dark tannins, the rich fruit and the concentrated structure. The wine is rich with great power although that is mitigated by the acidity and fresh aftertaste. The wine is, of course, still young and should be drunk from 2020."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Roederer Estate,28.0,93.0,"Gorgeous foam leads this wine, a blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay. Golden peach in color with a dry, savory strawberry richness and smooth texture, it is buoyed by solid acidity. Estate-grown, this is a stellar California sparkler, incredibly well-priced and versatile."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Kevin White,28.0,93.0,"Coming from Upland and Boushey vineyards, this wine is 60% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 7% Syrah. Expressive aromas of fresh blackberry, huckleberry, black pepper, smoked meat and herb are followed by penetratingly pure dark fruit flavors that are rich but still bring a sense of freshness. The purity is dazzling as is the length on the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Deaver,28.0,93.0,"The power and richness of Port fill this extreme—and extremely delicious—Zinfandel. It is very deep in color and vivid in aroma, like the scent of ripe grapes at the crusher on harvest day. It fills the mouth with apparent sweetness that lingers long on the finish. Perfect match for after dinner with blue cheese and toasted walnuts, or a cigar."
Merlot,US,Washington,Stevens,28.0,93.0,"As in past vintages, this is half DuBrul and half Meek vineyard fruit. It's a far cry from what most consumers would think of as Merlot—this is a stiff, tannic, muscular wine, with a deep earthiness that speaks of rich loam and ancient rock. It strikes me as more typical of Malbec. The tannins are firm and dense, and the fruits are black as coal and laced with tar and smoke."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,E. Guigal,28.0,93.0,"Apart from the fact that this wine comes from a small parcel that is itself called Saint-Joseph, the other curiosity of this wine is its label, which is designed like a banknote, by the man who used to design French francs (now, of course, out of a job). The wine inside the bottle is powerful and concentrated, flavored heavily with new wood, vanilla and spicy fruits. Guigal believes it is possible to make great Saint-Joseph, and this wine certainly proves the point."
Chardonnay,US,California,Mignanelli,28.0,93.0,"From Mt. Eden and Wente clones grown at 1,700 feet, this under-$30 bottling shows key lime and pomelo pith freshness on the nose, backed by chalk, crushed sea shell and tangerine blossom aromas. There is a fine-grained texture to the tannins on the palate, where bright citrus fruit meets with marcona almond touches. It's simultaneously refreshing and savory."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Rubino Estates Winery,28.0,93.0,"A beautiful black currant character animates this classically-styled wine. It's fruity and generously spiced on the nose, with cinnamon and nutmeg scents from oak. Its flavors build on that black currant, with spice notes giving it a layered effect, supported by fine-grained tannins. While irrestible now, this will be best after 2019."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,28.0,93.0,"Among all eight of the winery's current Rieslings, this was the least accessible upon opening. With ample breathing time it began to show more aromatics, with flavors of orange and pear in a nicely concentrated, well-balanced package. This is the one to decant!"
Zinfandel,US,California,Cline,28.0,93.0,"There's a lovely sweetness to the fruit, which tastes like ripe, just-picked blackberries. Old vines, 100+ years, deliver sweet, supple, sexy fruit. The wine has very dry tannins, and it might profit from some blending, but with a vineyard this special you have to admire the single-vineyard approach."
Zinfandel,US,California,Cline,28.0,93.0,"A blast of spice, mint, bramble and pepper explodes from the glass. The wine is dense, dark, deep and mysterious; the flavors pungent, penetrating and persistent. Tannic, layered with herbs and spices, powered with big, punchy fruit. This is classic Cline."
Syrah,US,California,Sinor-LaVallee,28.0,93.0,"This feral and gamy wine shows roast lamb, rosemary, dried fennel, rose petal and forest floor aromas on its dynamic nose. The palate leads with explosive acidity, before waves of Concord grape and blackberry flavor take hold. It's light on its feet but has some textural firmness, finishing on rosemary, lavender and game notes."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Braida di Giacomo Bologna,28.0,93.0,"Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, forest berry and Alpine herb take center stage in this elegant and structured red. The vibrant palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry compote, star anise and tobacco hints alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Impeccably balanced and delicious, it also offers incredible value. Drink through 2029."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Love & Squalor,28.0,93.0,"A sensational value, this is a Pinot lover's wine, beginning with the gorgeous color of a deep red/orange sunset. Cherries, chocolate, and a light touch of orange peel elevate the aromatics and inform the well-integrated midpalate. The wine lingers gracefully through an immaculate finish."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Antigal,28.0,93.0,"Hedonistic berry, raisin and fig flavors are complete. While this is tight and tough on the palate, it's solid as a boulder in terms of structure and balance. A ripe mix of black-fruit and mocha flavors finishes with all the power one could ask for. Drink this Bordeaux blend through 2027."
Zinfandel,US,California,Kokomo,28.0,93.0,"This wine surprises and delights in its heady perfume and depth of cherry, cinnamon and brown sugar. Undoubtedly ripe, it holds its boldness well, allowing for glimpses of elegance amid the velvety layers of serious flavor."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,28.0,93.0,"The estate wine of Aydie is the most serious and long-lasting of the range produced by the Laplace family. It has an intense, concentrated structure, very dark and rich, with a mineral edge. Age for 4–5 years."
Viognier,US,Washington,Abeja,28.0,93.0,"This new vintage of Abeja's estate-grown Viognier is back to a richer mouthfeel after the high acid 2008, with generous citrus and stone fruits—peach and pear—candied lemon and pineapple, highlighted with cinnamon spice. Flat out yummy, roundly fruity, and long-lasting, with butterscotch ruling the finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Chesebro,28.0,93.0,"Bountiful and rich black fruits of black currant and black cherry meet with dark clove and other baking spices as well as a hint of maple on the nose of this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend. The palate's chalky structure is soft, allowing strong spice to rise amidst the black fruit in the midpalate, followed by a wave of plummy purple-flower flavors. The finish is all acid, which makes for a compelling combo of sensations."
Tempranillo,US,Oregon,Dominio IV,28.0,93.0,"The winery holds back its wines to good effect. There's no sign of fatigue here, just well-integrated complex meaty flavors. It's dusky and dark, with aromas of smoke, tobacco and espresso. Flavors include all of the above around black fruits and slightly gritty tannins. It's dense and delicious and ready to drink."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,28.0,93.0,"The Ribbon Ridge vineyard, adjacent to the winery, brings exceptional minerality to underscore potent grapefruit and pineapple flavors. The proportion, length and overall balance are outstanding. This wine responds well to decanting, and has the structure to age gracefully for at least a decade. Drink now through 2025."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Proteus,28.0,93.0,"Like the winery's other Pinot Noir, this seems way underpriced for the quality. Its subtle layers of cherry and plum are enhanced with baking spice, toasted coconut and caramel highlights. It can easily stand beside wines costing twice as much. Drink now through 2028."
Merlot,US,Washington,Seven Hills,28.0,93.0,"Right out of the chute this has sappy, delicious black cherry fruit, accented with scents of tobacco and graphite. Streaks of ash and more juicy berries fill the middle, as it unfolds into a taut, sculpted finish. A classical style from a vintage that favors it; accessible, yet built for cellaring."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Portal,28.0,93.0,"Still very youthful, this concentrated wine has structure, deep black-fruit flavors and intense acidity. Its wood aging offers an extra spice note and a polished surface. Underneath, the wine is dense, needing aging. Give it 2–4 years."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Cave de Ribeauvillé,28.0,93.0,"A touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose but soon relaxes into soft notes of ripe black cherry. The palate is textured and dry, harmonious with fruit and the gentle ripple and crunch of slightly rustic but utterly pleasant tannins. This seems to be its perfect drinking window now: generous with fruit, utterly harmonious and starting to mellow. The finish is fresh, clean and totally moreish. If you can resist at all, this may well continue to develop. Drink now through 2025."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Salomon-Undhof,28.0,93.0,"This is a ripe, creamy wine made with grapes from a single vineyard. It's smooth yet laced with minerality and a tang of lemon zest, green apple and kiwi. This should age nicely for 3–4 years."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,28.0,93.0,"Lip tingling lime acidity sends a jolt through this lusciously fruity wine. Off dry in style, it juxtaposes sweet-tart lemon and honey tangerine flavors against steely, piercing minerality."
Syrah,US,Washington,Kevin White,28.0,93.0,"This wine is 100% Syrah from Boushey, Olsen and Elephant Mountain vineyards. Alluring aromas of herb, blackberry, bramble, green olive, flower and smoked meat lead to a richly flavored palate that explodes with abundant savory, meaty flavors. It drinks like a charcuterie plate, with plenty of fresh herbs rounding it out."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Eder,28.0,93.0,"While nose and palate shine with beautifully precise pear, there is a core of wonderfully pure mandarin. There are hints of zesty grapefruit spice but the concentrated purity of fruit makes this stand out. Tangy citrus means the ripeness is harnessed into a linear streamlined direction that gives this drive and lively energy. This is moreish and impressive."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,28.0,93.0,"The aromatics impress with bold notes of lemon tea, orange blossom and Key lime. The vineyard's typical minerality is in full force, underscoring bone-dry flavors of wet stone, tarragon, chervil, lime and grapefruit. The density and balance are impressive."
Picpoul,US,California,Four Lanterns,28.0,93.0,"If this bottling is any indication, Picpoul may be Paso Robles' best chance at becoming better known for white wines. Tense chalk, baking soda, pomelo pith and lime skin aromas show on the fresh and compelling nose. The palate is tightly wound and nervy, showing clean, grippy kumquat and citrus rind flavors. That tension holds firm even days after opening."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,MacLaren,28.0,93.0,"This is a lighthearted, well-crafted take on the variety made for the producer's mother, Lee. It's bright and rich simultaneously, with highlights of tropical pineapple and mango supported by crisp minerality and a refreshing finish of tangerine and lime zest."
Tempranillo,US,Washington,Waters,28.0,93.0,"This is the winery's first commercial release of this varietal, all aged in neutral French oak. It offers nuanced aromas of spice, tobacco, vanilla and savory notes that are followed by plentiful, palate-coating red and blue-fruit flavors that extend out through a long, fruit and spice-filled finish. Firm tannins provide the structure. It needs time still but possesses a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Clos de L'Oratoire des Papes,28.0,93.0,"The Ogier firm, which controls this property, has made great strides recently. This is full bodied and silky in texture without being overly soft, and it boasts complex, well-integrated, interleaving notes of dark fruit, mocha, spice and earth. Drink 2015–2025."
Roviello,Italy,Southern Italy,Contrade di Taurasi - Lonardo,28.0,93.0,"Here's a gorgeous wine made with Roviello, an obscure and nearly extinct grape from Campania. It opens with an alluring floral fragrance punctuated with citrus and spice. The elegant, structured palate delivers grapefruit, cinnamon and intense, focused mineral alongside crisp acidity. Hold for more complexity. Drink now through 2020."
Syrah,US,California,Martin Ranch,28.0,93.0,"Remarkably intriguing aromas of dragon's blood spice (a Southeast Asian incense) as well as cinnamon and dried raspberries arise on this wine by Dan and Thérèse Martin. The palate is also highly floral, like sipping a purple bouquet, with violet and ollallieberry flavors that linger after your sip is done."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Lava Cap,28.0,93.0,"Pure, concentrated grape flavors fill up this full-bodied and well-balanced wine. It's a pleasure to smell and taste the black currant and cherry character, deftly and lightly accented by baking spice. The velvety texture fills the mouth and propels those flavors through a lingering finish. It will drink best after 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,28.0,93.0,"The very gentle but seductive notion of sun-ripened red-cheeked mirabelle plums radiates like sunshine from the glass. With a further sniff there also is peppery greenery: yarrow and hay. The palate also unites this friendly fruit with the savory spice of these herbs and comes in a light-footed, compact and fresh package that just dances on the tongue. This is deceptively frivolous Grüner with a seriously delicious concentrated core."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Abadia Retuerta,28.0,93.0,"Few wines offer as much as this for under $30, but this extracted, bullish Tempranillo blend is not for everyone. Blackberry, cola and savory herbal aromas are strong and pure. This feels wide and cushioned, yet is still a driller. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors finish rich and ripe. Drink through 2024."
Chardonnay,US,California,Baileyana,28.0,93.0,"Burgundy-raised vintner Christian Roguenant gets to show his stuff in this line of Firepeak wines. Wet cement, honeysuckle, crisp Asian pear and the slightest hints of tropicality show on the nose, while the palate offers yellow grapefruit, lemon skins, squeezed lime and lime-blossom flavors, wrapped around nervy tension."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,28.0,93.0,"A dark and spicy wine, with streaks of mineral and herb buried within very tart, acidic black fruit. This is complex, quite youthful and tightly woven. I think it will require some years to pull itself together, but the balance is here, in a medium-bodied style, showing some herb, some citrus and plenty of muscle. Tasted over many hours after being decanted, it showed itself to be a wonderful wine that developed multiple layers of flavor."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Jean-Max Roger,28.0,93.0,"A blend of wines from caillottes stony soil and Kimmeridgian marl, this is an amalgam of ripe fruit and tense mineral texture. Together these two styles give a complex, impressive wine that has great concentration as well as aging potential. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Alloro,28.0,93.0,"Balanced and graceful, this barrel-fermented gem runs the gamut from apple to pear to peach, all framed with lively acids tasting of citrus and stone. It goes long and deep, with toast and spice beautifully proportioned."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Fitz-Ritter,28.0,93.0,"Delicate floral and stone fruit aromas build buoyantly on this dry, elegant Riesling. The palate is drenched with deep, ripe peach and apricot flavors, yet streaked with long, linear lines of mineral and acid. It's a thirst-quenching but remarkably structured wine at an approachable price."
Muscat Canelli,US,California,Mt. Konocti Winery,28.0,93.0,"This beauty of a sweet wine has a perfume like jasmine and honeysuckle blossoms and flavors like Anjou pears and lychees. It's very ripe, succulent and almost thick on the palate, but far from simply syrupy. The exotic flavors expand with each sip, and linger a long time on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Durant,28.0,93.0,"Peppery lime fruit highlights this single-clone effort. The impressive minerality brings clean flavors of wet rock into play. It's terrifically refreshing, with the crisp acidity to age nicely over the next six to eight years."
Syrah,US,Washington,Gramercy,28.0,93.0,"The aromas bring immediate appeal, with notes of brown stems, herbs, crushed flowers, smoked meat and black pepper. The flavors don't disappoint, showing purity, focus and generosity with a spot-on sense of balance and a lengthy finish that kicks it up a notch. Give it time to open up."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Terre Rouge,28.0,93.0,"Berries, sandalwood and cigar-box aromas lead to lavish fruit flavors like blackberry and raspberry. The multi-layered texture is both firm and velvety at the same time. Well supported by integrated tannins, this wine will pair well now with big proteins and will age easily through 2019."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Laurent Gauthier,28.0,93.0,"This wine is all structure at the moment. Dense, dry tannins are masking the fruit that is waiting to develop. Great acidity is pushing forward to give a more juicy character. This impressive wine just needs time, so drink from 2017."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine du Vissoux,27.0,93.0,The Chermette family has produced a rich generous cru wine. It is structured and dense with some firm tannins from maturing in wood. It also has a generous black plum and cherry fruits that are developing well. Drink this wine from late 2017.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ebner-Ebenauer,27.0,93.0,"Rich notes of yeast on the nose promise a rounded wine, while on the palate they become even more pronounced and deliver a big hit of lasting umami flavors. Here and there white pepper pokes through with its freshness supported by leavening citrus notes. This is powerful stuff: Handle with care and pair with food that is both subtle and robust—just like the wine."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Provence,Domaine la Bastide Blanche,27.0,93.0,"A wine that is structured and dominated at this stage by its tannins. The potential is there, showing in the rich, supporting fruit and berry flavors that come through as the wine opens up. Drink this wine with its good potential from 2017."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,27.0,93.0,The sand and granite soil of the Brand vineyard gives an intensely structured wine that's tight and steely. It's rich with apricot and pear flavors made crisp with refreshing acidity. Drink from 2015.
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Cave de Ribeauvillé,27.0,93.0,"The nose already promises both texture and ripeness with its combined aroma of russet pear peel and juicy pear flesh. The palate only adds to the juicy richness with a good dollop of residual sweetness, boosting all of the pear fruit. This is countered by wonderful lemon drop freshness. The plump but shapely palate is utterly concentrated and aromas of candle wax and honeycomb show that this has just begun to evolve. While the finish has distinct sweetness, it is balanced by 2010's glorious freshness. Lovely now, especially alongside cheese or hot Asian spice, but sure to develop further. Drink 2017–2030."
Riesling,US,California,Smith-Madrone,27.0,93.0,"From 41-year-old vines on just over five estate acres, this is resiny and briny on the nose. A honey-laced creaminess at the core is tensely accentuated by vibrant acidity. Balanced and elegant, with a sunny bite of ripeness, it revels in nuances of fresh and dried apricot while lighter notes of lemon, lime and grapefruit play backup."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Trimbach,27.0,93.0,"The aromas are rather shy on the nose—there is just a mere floral whiff. The palate is dry and lets us see subtle varietal aromas: golden peach, a touch of honeysuckle spice, a hint of jasmine, aromatic orange zest. This is a restrained, streamlined and elegant varietal expression. Drink now through 2030."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,27.0,93.0,"The exquisitely restrained nose has just a touch of honeysuckle perfume—just a hint of that spicy headiness. These aromas also color the fine, ripe and juicy peach fruit on the palate that vies with fine citrus zestiness for attention. Slight residual sweetness caresses the fruit on the palate but this is very subtly done. The finish is off dry, but utterly balanced. This is a very beautiful, elegant and fresh Gewurztraminer. Drink now through 2030."
Chardonnay,US,California,Gundlach Bundschu,27.0,93.0,"Gravelly texture supports rich yet balanced baked apple and anise flavors in this hugely appealing wine from old vines in one of the producer's estate vineyards. As it opens, more floral components come to life, recalling jasmine and apple blossom, feeling high-toned and refreshing."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,27.0,93.0,"Yeasty funk hovers above rich beckoning peach. The dry palate then expands and comprises taut, translucent citrus, exuding a cool calm charm. This is slender and fresh and shows concentration but no heaviness. It's a wonderfully fine-boned delicate Riesling of subtle power. Impressive long and whistle-clean finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mascota,27.0,93.0,"Dusty berry and plum aromas are inviting and come with notes of vanilla and coconut. This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc is flush while displaying a firm grip. Flavors of vanilla, mocha, black cherry and blackberry finish deep and with a lasting hint of fig. Drink through 2024."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Deaver,27.0,93.0,"In a flight of incredibly dark, rich and mouth-coating wines, this one stood out as especially concentrated and high octane, but well-balanced. It smells and tastes like perfectly charred steak, dark chocolate, blackberry jam without the sweetness and spices like clove and cardamom. It's so tempting to drink now, but will be best after 2020."
Pinot Nero,Italy,Piedmont,Colombo,27.0,93.0,"Fragrant and refined, this polished red opens with enticing scents of woodland berry, menthol, pressed violet and a whiff of dried herb. The creamy, luminous palate delivers strawberry, raspberry and cake spice alongside fresh acidity and refined tannins."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Abelis Carthago,27.0,93.0,"The Lui & William bodega is behind this outstanding Tempranillo from Toro. The wine shows a brilliant violet tint in front of intense, inky aromas of black cherry and chocolate cake. The palate is superripe and bucks like a bronco; the tannins are dense and form titanic structure, and the finish of coffee and spice hints at a fine cigar. It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Fischer,27.0,93.0,"Inviting citrus and herbal notes lead to yeasty freshness, bright lemon acidity and the peppery savoriness of watercress and arugula. It's wonderfully concentrated, long and streamlined with a full and lasting flavor. Good now but will open up nicely."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Louis Sipp,27.0,93.0,"Peach, rose and lychee unite into a very rich, seamless perfume on the nose. Those exact flavors expand on the fluid, almost oily palate, supported by residual fruit sweetness: at six years of age this is now toned down and has come into its own. If you're after a treat with washed-rind cheeses, choose this medium-sweet gem."
Alsace white blend,France,Alsace,Clément Klur,27.0,93.0,"The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Adegas Gran Vinum,27.0,93.0,"This gorgeous Albariño opens with elegant aromas of white flowers, peach and minerals. There's ample acidity, body and flow to the palate, while flavors of nectarine, tangerine and lemon are top-shelf. A long-lasting, clean-as-polished-glass finish confirms excellent overall quality."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine l'Ancienne Cure,27.0,93.0,"Dark chocolate and black currant flavors dominate this concentrated wine. It is densely tannic, while still allowing room for the brooding fruit to show through. Still young, it will age slowly and impressively over the next five years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta de Sant'Ana,27.0,93.0,"Blending Aragonez with Touriga Nacional has produced a magnificently structured wine, big and bold and packed with dark fruits. The wood aging and the firm tannins show strongly even after four years and the wine obviously needs aging. There is a fine, juicy backdrop that will develop to give a serious, complex and impressive wine. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,Gundlach Bundschu,27.0,93.0,"This producer continues to impress in quality and focus. Proving the point, this estate-grown white proffers inviting teases of jasmine and tropical-kissed peach and pear. Tangy acidity finds a complement of texture and body, delivering voluptuousness that remains elegant in the glass."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Eder,27.0,93.0,"Gorgeously lifted, fresh notes of lemon and mandarin peel make for a zesty opening. The midpalate fizzes with citric energy and is so tightly wound that this wine needs time in the cellar so the fruit can express itself. Drink 2017–2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Dão Sul,27.0,93.0,"The historic vineyard of Casa de Santar in the heart of the Dão region has produced a dense and powerful offering, with rich tannins and black fruits. Its intense, solid blackberry and spice flavors are followed by acidity, contributing complexity. Age for at least four years."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Niederösterreich,Malat,27.0,93.0,"The floral, vanilla tone of new oak marries with ripe, red cherry notes in this wine, supported by clove and violet highlights. It's young and taut on the palate, its fine tannins still firm and crunchy, needing time to evolve and relax. Pure fruit and the pervasive freshness promise a bright future. Drink 2019–2025."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,27.0,93.0,"Savory and deep, it carries lovely details of earth and herb, balanced against flavors of lightly spiced apples. As with all the Eyrie wines from this outstanding vintage, it's unique, compelling and utterly original."
Merlot,Canada,British Columbia,Tinhorn Creek,27.0,93.0,"Precise and polished, this wine offers up a mix of fig, plum, black cherry, chocolate and caramel. A streak of graphite underscores the polished tannins. Good already, this can be cellared and enjoyed through 2028 and perhaps beyond."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Sierra Cantabria,27.0,93.0,"Crisp, toasty oak and spice aromas are currently outranking this wine's berry-fruit components...but only for now. In five or more years, this will be less oaky and more complex. At this point in time, look for a sinewy, tight, almost jagged palate with toasty, robust flavors of plum and berry, dry spices and mixed herbs along with firm tannins. A long, balanced finish bodes well for the future. Drink through 2030."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Luis Cañas,27.0,93.0,"The excellence of the 2010 vintage is draped all over this studly Rioja. Earthy aromas of mixed berry fruits and forest floor feed into a saturated but well-balanced palate with firm tannins. Baked black cherry and cassis flavors meander towards a lightly toasted finish with mocha, chocolate and cassis notes. This is outright delicious more than stately or complex. Drink through 2024."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Fischer,27.0,93.0,"Restrained but earthy notes of lemon zest play against slight, flinty smoke. This is still rather closed but the still-dormant expanse of ripe fruit is evident on the palate. The zesty lemon core takes turns with yeasty richness to dazzle. Wonderfully long."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Fischer,27.0,93.0,"The nose does not want to give any more away than a yeasty, savory glint. On the palate, this evolves into a peppery, herbal core with real texture and depth. Fruit, apart from citrus, remains hidden for now, still held in that primary, yeasty center that already sends out sprays of spice. Delicious and intriguing now, probably even more interesting in the coming two to three years."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Russiz Superiore,26.0,93.0,"Classic Sauvignon aromas of cut grass, straw, tropical fruit and crushed tomato vine mingle in the glass. The vibrant, elegant palate shows finesse and balance, delivering juicy white peach, grapefruit and green melon alongside crisp acidity."
Chardonnay,US,California,Stolo,26.0,93.0,"Warm tones of marzipan, roasted almond, yellow peach, pineapple and a touch of coconut are reminiscent of a piña colada on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard just behind the coastal town of Cambria. Gala apples and poached pears show on the sip along with lemon curd, chalk and meringue flavors, all tightly woven into a fresh expression of the grape."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château du Cèdre,26.0,93.0,"This wine is ripe in spicy black-currant aromas on the nose and intense in juicy black fruit on the dense palate. The rich, generous layers of fruit perfectly balance the tannins that build up to a harmonious whole. Still young, it will be best from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta do Sobral,26.0,93.0,"In the increasingly important Dão region, Sobral's top-of-the-range is an impressively rich dense wine. With its great tannins and generous black fruits, it is full of potential. Produced by winemaker Carlos Lucas from a selection of grapes as well as parcels, the wine is concentrated, dark and firm. The acidity gives it great life as well as a juicy character that emphasizes the ripe fruit. The wine is still young, drink from 2019."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Richard Rottiers,26.0,93.0,"Produced from vines up to 80 years old, this is a powerful, wood-aged wine. Tannins are mixed with toast, spice and dark plum flavors. Acidity gives freshness and finishes the wine with very fine fruits as well as structure. Age this impressive wine and drink from 2018."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Ambra,26.0,93.0,"Sunbaked soil, new leather, forest floor and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this. The smooth elegantly structured palate delivers morello cherry, black raspberry, dried herb, licorice and tobacco while fine-grained tannins provide polished support."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Trimbach,26.0,93.0,"A lifted, ethereal note of bitter almond suggests the beginnings of evolution. The palate, on the other hand, still seems closed but displays a streamlined concentrated core of flawless dryness and precise bundled freshness. This is taut, precise and sure to develop. The finish is lasting, refreshing and clean. Drink now through 2030."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,26.0,93.0,"Produced in one of the great sweet wine regions of France, this rich honeyed wine is intense while always preserving acidity and a crisp apple character. Honey and flavors of botrytis are balanced with the acidity and apricot flavors the give the wine its freshness. Drink this beautiful wine from 2018."
Trousseau Gris,US,California,Zeitgeist,26.0,93.0,"From old vines within the Fanucchi Wood Road Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this is a rare bottling of a variety more commonly found in the Jura, but acquiring new fans in California, especially made at this high level. Creamy and round, it remains fresh on the palate in a lemon-swirled minerality that provides a savory edge of ginger."
Mourvèdre,France,Provence,La Bastide Blanche,26.0,93.0,"This is an opulent, rich wine that is full of black plums, powerful tannins and spice. Mourvèdre dominates the palate with its power and exotic aroma, but bright acidity guides a long finish. Still young, it needs several years to develop, so drink from 2016."
Red Blend,US,California,Kokomo,26.0,93.0,"Toasty graham crackers and nutmeg make for a compelling entry into this wine, a blend of Petite Sirah, Merlot, Carignan, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. The disparate elements come together in a bold, concentrated way, the tannins integrated around dark, black fruit and leathery black pepper."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Vigneau-Chevreau,26.0,93.0,"The abbey of Marmoutier was founded in the 4th century by Saint Martin. The walled vineyard is owned by the city of Tours, across the Loire from Vouvray. The wine is off dry, ripe with pear and honey and deliciously balanced with the acidity. It is young and will repay aging, so drink from 2020."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Michael David,26.0,93.0,"A superdark color and effusive aromas of wood smoke, raisin and dried fig set the stage for extremely concentrated, ripe fruit on the palate and a thickly tannic texture. The exuberance of the grape and blackberry flavors nicely counterbalances the firm texture. This will age well, so best to drink it after 2020."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaji,Disznókö,26.0,93.0,"This late harvest wine is straw in color, with aromas of yellow peaches, white flowers and apricots. It's well balanced, with a pleasing level of acidity to offset the ripe, fruit-driven palate."
Viognier,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,26.0,93.0,"Creamy yet not overly viscous, this wine finds a nice balance between fruit and juicy acidity, showing off well-crafted apricot, green apple and nut notes. Light bodied and totally fresh, it gains layers of citrus as it evolves in the glass."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Woodward Canyon,26.0,93.0,"This Sancerre-like effort shows amazing concentration and distinct, vineyard-driven flavors of grain and herb. Racy, textural, crisp and penetrating, it's lifted by a refreshing minerality. Lemon polish, citrus oil, a very delicate suggestion of honey in the nose and mouth, and above all a wonderful persistence make this a standout Sauvignon Blanc."
Zinfandel,US,California,Earthquake,26.0,93.0,"This is Zinfandel at its richest. Boysenberry, vanilla and maple syrup aromas meet up with jammy fruit flavors that coat the mouth and linger on the finish. For all its fullness, it stays balanced and dry. It does not feel heavy in texture nor heavily oaked."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,26.0,93.0,"This is true Tannat, black colored, powerful and firm. It also has fruit weight, potentially delicious black plums, damsons and dark berries that give aging potential. For now, it has tannins, a dark, brooding character and concentration. Age at least until 2018."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Rede,26.0,93.0,"Packed with ripe fruit, this wood-aged wine is dense and rich. A blend of Arinto and the Douro's local white grape, Rabigato, it is full of the ripest yellow fruits, laced through with stony minerality. The acidity and the spice from the wood give this wine its aging potential. Drink from 2019."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Michel Fonne,26.0,93.0,"A rich floral notion of dandelion precedes the rich aroma of ripe peaches on the nose. The palate opens into a kind of vast peach mellowness, edged with a touch of citrus zest and a grounding, earthy element. A gentle sweetness boosts the peachy roundedness but does not dominate. This is gentle on the surface but very concentrated at the core. It is on the off-dry finish that the lemon zest comes though triumphantly. Drink 2017–2027."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,26.0,93.0,"Peach and honey characterize the nose on this golden wine. These flavors also play generously on the concentrated rich midpalate where they are countered by aromatic orange and tangerine zestiness, creating a lovely contrast and exciting richness. There is just a touch of residual sweetness here to create some drama, but it works to great effect. The wine is not sweet enough for deserts but will work with Asian spices or ripe cheeses. It's simply wonderful and so balanced."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,26.0,93.0,"What rises from the glass is reminiscent of very ripe sun-warmed mirabelle and pear. The palate supports these fruits with wonderful, zesty concentration of citrus notes which also give a lovely pithy texture and brightness to the wine. The palate is dry and slender but has real impact. The finish is long, fresh and aromatic."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Provence,Domaine le Galantin,26.0,93.0,"Full bodied and rich, this is already showing its style and concentration. It is big and powerful with dark black fruits that show through strongly. The acidity and the dense structure promise good aging. Drink from 2016."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,26.0,93.0,"Green and yellow pear are subsumed into a savory whole composed of yeast and crushed kitchen herbs. There are highlights of Granny Smith apple and lemon rind, of lovage and white pepper, and all of these flavors are put into tight, peppery focus on the slender but concentrated palate. This fizzes with peppery spice and zest."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Michel Fonne,26.0,93.0,"Dandelion, earthiness and apple peel appear vividly on the nose, and a certain creaminess can also be discerned. The off-dry palate is incredibly fruity and boosts the sweetness of deliciously ripe apples while remaining absolutely tart and fresh. The finish is dry and fresh but this will echo any sweet element in an otherwise savory dish. Delicious and long. Drink 2017–2035."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,26.0,93.0,"Blossomy and perfumed, yet reverberating with steel, acid and minerals, this stunning off-dry Riesling packs so much more power and punch than it's diminutive frame suggests. Sweet, pristine white peach and cherry flavors persist through a long, meandering finish. Drinks beautifully now, but is powerful enough to evolve well till at least 2025."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Rede,26.0,93.0,"Due to its location near the western end of the Douro vineyards, this vineyard makes very fine white wines. This one is at the top, with wood fermentation and aging giving richness, intense flavors and a fine structure. It's a wine that demands serious aging—ripe and full of zesty acidity as well as toast and spice flavors. Start drinking this impressive wine from late 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,26.0,93.0,"Fresh green floral and lime zest lend vibe to this fine-footed, almost feather-textured kabinett. It's spry but surprisingly powerful, amplified by soaring grapefruit acidity and penetrating green-apple and pear flavors. Finishes long with a delicately honeyed touch. Drink now through 2021."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,26.0,93.0,"Hints of dusty mineral and caramelized sugar lend complexity to deep, penetrating layers of honey, peach and yellow plum in this light-footed, yet resounding, kabinett. Delicately sweet and puckering with lemon-lime acidity, it's a deftly balanced wine that resonates long on the finish. Drink now through 2021."
Chardonnay,US,California,Storrs,26.0,93.0,"This is a very intriguing, tasty and cerebral bottling from this producer, which has an urban tasting room in the heart of Santa Cruz. Aromas of Brie-cheese rind, Meyer-lemon pith, light jasmine and sea-salt-crusted cashew lead into a very grippy palate laden with pomelo pith and incredibly vibrant citrus and saline flavors."
Red Blend,US,California,Kokomo,26.0,93.0,"Perfumed and high-toned, this is an impressively crafted and priced blend of 35% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Malbec, 16% Grenache and 5% Petite Sirah. It shows a peek into each variety's personality, luxuriating in black pepper, leather, meat and black jam, with a juicy lushness to the palate."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Bernard Baudry,26.0,93.0,"From clay and silex soil at the foot of the hill behind the Baudry house, this solid, richly fruity wine brings out both concentrated tannins and opulent, red berry flavors. Showing the great potential structure from old vines, this is a wine for aging over at least six years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,26.0,93.0,"Juicy Alicante Bouschet shines in this smooth, rich wine. Dark tannins are cushioned by the ripe berry fruits and opulent texture. Wood-aging has given extra richness to this powerful and complex wine that needs time. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mittelrhein,Matthias Müller,26.0,93.0,"While still vibrantly peachy and floral, four years of bottle aging have given this off-dry Riesling sumptuous tertiary complexities of dusty mineral and white mushroom. It's feather light on the palate yet deeply penetrating in honeyed tangerine and stone fruit flavors. Drink now through 2021."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Skinner,26.0,93.0,"This extremely flavorful wine smells like fig, almond and custard, and tastes like butterscotch, lemon meringue and toasted almond. It is quite full bodied, almost thick in texture and about to burst at the seams with richness."
Chardonnay,US,California,Ruby Hill Winery,26.0,93.0,"Rich and spicy, full-bodied but gentle, this wine oozes ripe pear, vanilla, fig and hazelnut from the nose to the palate to the lingering finish. It boasts concentration yet comes across as dry, thanks to the balance that its bracing acidity brings. Best from 2018."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Michel Fonne,26.0,93.0,"There is not just a notion of ripeness but almost of overripeness of pear fruit on the nose, accompanied by hints of honeysuckle. There also are hints of sandalwood and gentle vanilla. The palate is cushioned with mellow residual sweetness, making the rich flavors even more rich and generous. A vein of citrus freshness counters this, but this is in the generous, medium-sweet spectrum, oozing fruit and generosity. The finish, nonetheless, is precise and fresh. A great example of mature Pinot Gris."
Chardonnay,US,California,Melville,26.0,93.0,"A brilliant balance of ripe ruby-red grapefruit juice and corresponding bitter-sour elements from the same fruit's pith mesh with tangerine oil, crushed ant, iodine and a bit of dairy funk on the nose of this wine. The palate's grippy texture shows apple peels, Key lime pith, baking soda and an almost peppery zing, suggesting lots of life. Drink 2016–2023."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kynsi,26.0,93.0,"This wine from the historic vineyard is light in color but not shy on the nose at all: lime blossoms, lemon curds, honeysuckle and lemon-lime soda all leap from the glass. The palate combines chopped dill and dewy herbs with green fruits, from pears to kiwi to lime peels, all presented with a lot of briskness."
White Blend,US,California,Terre Rouge,25.0,93.0,"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Istine,25.0,93.0,"Floral and black fruit aromas are punctuated by spicy notes on the nose of this wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black-cherry, white pepper, mint and sage along with big but ripe tannins and edgy acidity. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2015–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,San Simeon,25.0,93.0,"Elegant and attractive aromas of dark violet, red rose, cedar and a touch of vanilla serve as a promising entry point to this Cabernet. A bit of char kicks in on the palate alongside dark chocolate, espresso and ripe plum skin, with roasted beet in the background."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tenet,25.0,93.0,"Directly appealing, this wine is bursting with aromas of plum, red currant, herb and spice–all showing freshness and purity. The palate is packed to the brim with supple fruit flavors, full of density and weight, while never getting bogged down. It hits the delicious gong hard."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Clos Henri,25.0,93.0,"This property excels in some vintages,and the 2015 is a huge success. It's certainly complex, effortlessly combining hints of pungency with soothing notes of grapefruit. In the mouth, it's fairly full and creamy in texture, then punctuates that richness with a long, vibrant finish."
Riesling,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,25.0,93.0,"A combination of grapefruit zest, russet-pear peel, ripe apple and fresh lemon creates a nose and palate that are alluring, refreshing and very fruity. A bit of that zestiness is also apparent on the midpalate texture that delivers crunch, finesse and an enlivening purity. The finish is dry and long, full of moreish juiciness."
Chenin Blanc,US,Washington,Kiona,25.0,93.0,"The aromas draw you in with notes of kiwi, pineapple and mango. Brown sugar and tropical fruit flavors are intensely sweet and rich, with an unctuous feel."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,25.0,93.0,"This exceptional wine explodes in classic, characteristic aromas of rose water, dried rose petals and orange blossom, so floral and sublime. Edgy in taste, with a trace of salt, it exhibits no oak, celebrating instead an exuberance of fresh pear and grapefruit."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Cave de Hunawihr,25.0,93.0,"A subtle touch of lemon appears first. On the palate, this is amplified with lemony zest and brightness. Wonderfully dry and light, with a singing, illuminating freshness, this enlivens the palate and puts a spring in your step. There is concentration but also a wonderfully light touch. This is dry and utterly invigorating with a bracing, long and vivid finish of pure lemon. Drink 2017–2030."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Fontes da Cunha,25.0,93.0,"Named after the river that flows through the Dão region, this wine is powerful, concentrated and serious. Still young and full of tannins, it also has ripe black fruits and balancing acidity. The structure brings out the granite soil of the region, with its dark, brooding quality. This is a fine wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mascota,25.0,93.0,"Deep and lush up front, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cab Franc offers highly appealing aromas of blackberry and toast. Dense, layered and hefty on the palate, this extracted but well-balanced blend piles on blueberry, black plum, cassis and toast flavors. On the finish, darker notes of espresso and bitter chocolate take over. Drink now through 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,25.0,93.0,"The 2014 vintage produced so many standouts for St. Urbans-Hof, it's hard to decide on favorites, but this luminous Spätlese pulls quite a bit of weight for its dimunitive price tag. While delicate in frame, it's dramatic in composure, shifting from floral fruity exuberance to waxy, mineral and taut in each sip. It's drinking gorgeously now but should hold well, and perhaps improve, through at least 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Wittmann,25.0,93.0,"Intense aromas of tropical mango and melon scent this elegant, slightly cream-textured dry Riesling. Sprays of white grapefruit and lime juice brighten the midpalate, extending through a long finish marked by zesty acidity and chalky, dusty mineral tones. Drink now through 2019."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,25.0,93.0,"Richly textured wine, full of ripe and spicy fruit, the acidity just a hint behind the dried honey and watermelon flavors. It is full-bodied, ripe, packed with intense fruit flavors. A wine for aging over 3–4 years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Passadouro,25.0,93.0,"From a selection of old vines, this grand wine is rich and firmly structured. With dark tannins and powerful black plum fruit flavors, it is concentrated and with considerable aging potential. The wine is still young, packed with tannins and will not be ready to drink until 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lilian Ladouys,25.0,93.0,"Under the ownership of Jacky Lorenzetti, president of one of France's top rugby clubs, this estate is now performing impressively. The wine is finely structured with dark tannins and tight acidity and a hint of minerality. It is Merlot dominated, although it is the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that brings out the black-currant fruitiness. Drink from 2022."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Domdechant Werner,25.0,93.0,"This is an exceptionally priced wine that allows a glimpse into the power and density of Domdechant Werner's 2015 Rieslings. Yellow peach and nectarine flavors are vivaciously fresh, but there's a lot more than fruitiness here. It's forward and yielding, yet weighty, its richness nuanced by hints of smoke, graphite and caramel. Luscious, mouth clinging texture lingers on the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Wrath,25.0,93.0,"Deeply intriguing and funky aromas of sweet tar, charred blueberries and hot rubber emerge from this study of using minimal amounts of new oak on a typically oak-aged variety. Some may find the reductive nose challenging, but the palate is more approachable, with dark chocolate and cassis flavors."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Ovum,25.0,93.0,"Sourced from the Cedar Ranch vineyard in the Illinois Valley, this exquisite Riesling was entirely fermented with native yeast in both concrete egg and neutral wood. Given extended lees contact, it's textural and loaded with dry extract. Flavors highlight citrus rind, grapefruit and wet stone through the long and satisfying finish."
Riesling,Canada,Ontario,Cave Spring,25.0,93.0,"Elegant and detailed, this is a dry, racy wine with well-balanced flavors of lemon, lime, citrus and mineral. It's quite fresh and perfectly proportioned, with exceptional length. Delicious already, it can easily age until 2025 and probably well beyond."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,25.0,93.0,"The wine has power and considerable wood flavors at this young stage. It also has concentration of white and yellow fruits, well laced with acidity. Powerful while always balanced and stylish."
Tannat-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Vignobles Brumont,25.0,93.0,"The wine comes from a parcel of land planted with both Merlot and Tannat. In its structure, this great wine has a strong connection to the Madirans that are the hallmark of this producer. With maturity, the wine has developed fine secondary flavors and undergrowth and dried-fruit flavors. The wine, named after a standing stone found in the area, is very ready to drink."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beira Interior,Rui Roboredo Madeira,25.0,93.0,"A field blend of grapes from old vines plus a year in wood have given this wine both structure and concentration. Dark fruits, firm tannins and acidity are all present in this complex, age-worthy wine. It comes from vineyards just south of the Douro, grown on granite soils at a height of 2,100 feet. It's a serious wine that needs to age. Drink from 2019."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de la Pepière,25.0,93.0,"Made for aging, this wine is structured and firm. It has a dense texture surrounded by ripe white and yellow fruits. With a touch of spice and a pepper character, it is rich, impressive and full-bodied. Drink from 2017."
St. Laurent,Austria,Thermenregion,Stift Klosterneuburg,25.0,93.0,"Both tart and ripe red cherries characterize nose and palate. Ample, crunchy freshness gradually tips into juicy ripeness. The palate discloses lovely density, with overtones of licorice that create subtle, delicious resonance. The tannins are superfine and have a sexy little crunch. It's a totally balanced and beautiful red."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Mettler Family Vineyards,25.0,93.0,"This giant of a wine has aromas of charred oak, wood smoke and black pepper, with a palate of dense, deep and smoky tones that feel thick, tannic and chewy. It's a tour de force of spicy oak, fruit concentration and mouthcoating texture that's impressive to drink now but will be best after 2024."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaji,Dobogó,25.0,93.0,"This dry Furmint is brilliant gold in color, with notes of Bartlett pear, Granny Smith apple, and lime zest in the complex bouquet. These aromas transfer seamlessly onto the palate as vibrant fruit flavors, with round body and bracing minerality. Delightful with food or by itself as an apéritif."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Vignobles Brumont,25.0,93.0,"This comes from a parcel of red clay that is not found elsewhere in the region. It gives a powerful and hugely dense wine that boasts good concentration and ripe black fruits. There is no sense of any aging yet on this impressive wine with its acidity and opulent ripeness still intact. Drink now, although the wine will age for many years, certainly until 2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,25.0,93.0,"New wood gives this wine a polished feel, its berry fruits pushing through dense tannins. It is balanced in the sense that fruit and wood are coming well together, but this impressive wine needs several years' aging."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette,25.0,93.0,"Produced from old Malbec vines in the second terrace above the River Lot, the wine is darkly concentrated, with solid tannins and generous black fruits. Aging for 12 months has smoothed the square corners to create a wine that is hugely rich and rounded. It has the potential to age and become more opulent. Drink from 2020."
Red Blend,US,California,Villa San Juliette,25.0,93.0,"This blend of 32% Syrah, 16% Grenache, 14% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 12% Alicante Bouschet, 7% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petite Sirah truly sings, as the name implies. A strong boysenberry pie aroma is lifted by purple flower scents on the nose, and the palate's lush black cherry, vanilla and mocha spice flavors are reminiscent of a dessert wine without being sweet."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Borjón,25.0,93.0,"Very dark and dramatic, this delicious wine combines great balance with power. It has exotic fruit flavors and a light spiciness. The smooth, sculpted mouthfeel comes with rich, almost thick tannins that seem to extend the finish. This will find its full potential sometime after 2020."
Grenache,US,Washington,Syncline,25.0,93.0,"A sensational effort, this wine is 100% varietal, sourced from four vineyards scattered throughout the sprawling Columbia Valley. Fragrant and concentrated, its hallmarks are purity and intensity. Plum, cherry liqueur and cassis are the focus, with bright lemony acids adding lift and zip to the mouthfeel."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Fontes da Cunha,25.0,93.0,"This dark-colored wine, dominated by Touriga Nacional, is rich, perfumed and dense. It has impressive tannins and rich blackberry fruit. The structure is concentrated, giving the wine power as well as a sense of style. This ripe wine is ready to drink."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac,25.0,93.0,"This wine comes from a selection of parcels on the plateau above the Lot river in Cahors. It's rich and firm, with great wood and spice notes as well as exuberant black plum and berry fruit. With its acidity, still-young tannins and firm texture, it will age. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Pellegrini,25.0,93.0,"This is a heck of a value for a wine that would shine no matter its price. Juicy in exuberant red fruit along the lines of cherry, plum and pomegranate, it shares deeper undertones of concentration and richness on the midpalate, with subtle accents of rose, cardamom and dried herb."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Husch,25.0,93.0,"This sweet and vibrant wine is a rare find. Wonderful floral, grapefruit and honey aromas lead to incredibly concentrated ripe flavors on a lush texture that's lifted by underlying acidity. It's almost irresistible now, but will be best after 2022."
Petite Sirah,Israel,Samson,Dalton,25.0,93.0,"Dark violet-red in color, this wine has aromas of black cherry, lavender and confectioner's sugar. Cool and bright notes play off each other, with flavors of ripe black cherry, anisette, cranberry and sage. Soft tannins lead to a finish that is long-lasting but doesn't overstay its welcome."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Ca' dei Zago,25.0,93.0,"This lightly sparkling, terroir-driven wine is loaded with soul and finesse. It's ethereal and bone dry, with delicately alluring aromas and flavors of white spring flower, ripe apple, Bartlett pear, citrus and Alpine herb. Crisp acidity and a silky mousse provide balance and finesse while a mineral note energizes the focused finish. The sediment at the bottom of the bottle adds even more flavor to the last glass."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,25.0,93.0,"Rotier's top wine is an impressive, wood-aged example of how good red Gaillac can be. This spicy, black-fruited wine is packed with dark cherries, plums and dusty tannins. It needs to age even more, so drink this solid, long-lasting wine from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,25.0,93.0,"Open-tank fermentation gives this wine a ripe, jammy character that is balanced by the intense black fruits and acidity. Together they form a rich, structured, juicy and firm wine that is likely to age. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Januik,25.0,93.0,"Sharp, dense, tight and oaky; this has a lot of plump pineapple, apple and sweet citrus fruit. There is a wonderful mix of spice, herb, fruit and acid. Deep and focused, this wine has serious guts and the flavors last a good long time."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,25.0,93.0,"Yeasty funk still clings to the nose. Underneath that there is a concentrated palate with lovely texture. Spicy pith with hints of grapefruit zest, almond peel and shy pear all play on the rounded powerful body. There is bundled force and energy here. Bright, enlivening and luminous freshness makes for a moreish, dry finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sextant,25.0,93.0,"A unique and rich nose of clove, beet juice, freshly turned earth and wet chalkboard lead this wine. It's soft and peppery on the palate at first, with raspberry fruit, strong spice and excellent acidity."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Feiler-Artinger,25.0,93.0,"Iron oxide and earth inform the sumptuous red cherry fruit. The medium body is slender and toned, yet not without depth. The fruit lavishes notes of blossom and smoke; ripe but firm tannins provide structure. This is fresh, not overdone and honest. The name ""Umriss"" means contour, perhaps an outline of what this lovely variety can be. The lovely cherry aftertaste gives us an idea."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Tranche,25.0,93.0,"Whether or not you consider yourself a fan of varietal Cabernet Franc, this is a wine to explore and to savor. Pure fruit is set amidst generous streaks of herb and earth, framed by firm tannins. The wine opens slowly, and pretty cherry flavors emerge, along with black olive, pencil lead and complex barrel notes."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,25.0,93.0,"This is an impressive wine. It's so balanced between opulent ripe fruit and a tight texture. Wood aging complements the rich apricot and crisp apple flavors, adding spice and a touch of pepper. The more juicy nature of the wine comes through as it opens up; however, it does need to age more. so wait until 2017."
White Blend,US,Washington,Buty,25.0,93.0,"Fragrant with cut grass, peavine and sweet hay, leading into light fruit flavors of apple and pear. There are suggestions of sliced orange, and the creamy, textural mouthfeel derived from nine months of aging on the lees."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Chignard,25.0,93.0,"This powerful rich wine is finely structured and concentrated. It has weight from solid tannins that contrast with the high tones of the ripe red-cherry fruits. From a single parcel, this cru wine is dense, both firm and fresh. Drink from late 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Emmerich Knoll,25.0,93.0,"Yeast and citrus, chervil and white pepper meet on the nose. The palate blends a streak of pure citrus into all of this and lends sharp aromatic focus to the spicy, almost salty core. This is taut and toned, linear and long without a spare ounce of fat. Exciting and racy."
Syrah-Grenache,US,Washington,Kevin White,25.0,93.0,"Olsen vineyard Syrah and Upland vineyards Grenache combine in equal proportions, making a compelling blend that nicely counterpoints the winery's La Fraternité red. Here it's all about blue fruits, especially plums, along with some earthy, barnyard flavors. The structure and aromatics are outstanding, and the acidity of the vintage suggests this wine is the one to cellar, while the other wine is the one to gulp."
White Blend,Hungary,Tokaji,Patricius,25.0,93.0,"This late harvest sweet wine has caramelized pineapple, beeswax and apricot aromas that carry over effortlessly to the palate. It's soft and silky in texture, with a delicately sweet finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Julien Schaal,25.0,93.0,"Aromatically, this wine is still shy on nose and palate. Underneath that the linearity and inherent slenderness of ripe tangerine flesh and zest come though, enriched with an earthy notion of ripe pear. The palate is dry and energetic, but also still rather closed. The true colors are revealed on the finish, with a lasting pear note bundled on the concentrated, linear palate. Drink 2019–2030."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Fiuza,25.0,93.0,"Aromatic, tropical textured wine. Great flavors of ripe pineapple and mango balance with more green fruit characters and a twist of lime. The wood flavors are well restrained, offering just a touch of final spice."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,25.0,93.0,"This deep garnet-colored wine proffers fragrances of black cherry and dark plum with a flourish of green pepper. It is smooth on the palate, with silky tannins and flavors of black cherry, raspberry, Mediterranean herbs and licorice. A mélange of bright berries and smoky spice permeates the sleek finish."
Grenache,US,California,Lumen,25.0,93.0,"A bright, fresh nose of rose petals, brisk raspberry juice, cranberry, turned earth and a pinch of white pepper makes for a lively wine. The palate begins with juicy strawberry then settles into anise and citrusy spice, an expertly lively wine with chalky texture and vibrant energy. Winemaker Lane Tanner is new at Grenache, but she's rocking it."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,25.0,93.0,"Pure notes of red fruits reach the nose: Morello cherry and mulberry harmonize beautifully. Their purity pervades a palate that has the lightest touch: there is something authentic, beautiful and unforced about this. There is a suggestion, too, of herb, moss or undergrowth. This unpretentious winemaking style lets this pure, glorious fruit speak for itself and brings with it a profound sense of honest depth, bountiful earth and full-fruited balance."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Pierre Morin,25.0,93.0,"Old vines planted in the 1950s by a neighbor named Ovide form this complex wine. Aged for eight months on lees, it is a concentrated wine, tight with acidity and with nutty flavors that add complexity and give the wine depth. This beautiful wine needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,25.0,93.0,"A whole universe of fresh flavors opens up: lime zest and kaffir lime leaves, green Seville orange peel and camphor. This is pure, straight-laced, unfussy and honest refreshment. As clear as a mountain spring and as bracing. That last lick of freshness will take you to a weightless citric heaven."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Koehler,25.0,93.0,"Hearty black-cherry notes meet with leather, black spice and loam on this powerful bottling from a longtime winery that's seeing new life thanks to winemaker Colin Murphy. Concurrent waves of fruit and spice splash through the palate, with black plum, gingerbread, clove and allspice flavors."
Orange Muscat,US,California,Quady,25.0,93.0,"This sweet and flavorful wine has an orange-amber color and one of the most floral, perfumed aromas of any wine from anywhere. It smells like a giant bouquet of roses, jasmine and honeysuckle and tastes similarly, buoyed by apricot and peach flavors and a lively streak in the texture."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Michel Fonne,25.0,93.0,"The intense aroma of very ripe peach rises from the glass. There are nuances of orange peel, too. These become aromatically amplified on the rich, dense and almost grippy palate. There is great concentration and residual sweetness, countered by bitter pith and texture. This is mature and totally fluid, ample and generous but its maturity adds subtle tone to the eloquent aromas. The finish is medium dry and very, very long."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Nikolaihof,25.0,93.0,"Funky notes of yeast still dominate the nose, but there is an abundance of yellow, juicy pear and Russet apple once they blow off, framed by citrus freshness and underlined with a yeasty savoriness that recalls slightly pungent herbs like watercress and arugula. The finish is ultraclean."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Lamole di Lamole,25.0,93.0,"Classic varietal aromas of fragrant purple flower, wild berry and baking spice jump out of the glass. A blend of Sangiovese and 5% Canaiolo, the juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, herb and mocha alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's already delicious and well balanced. Drink through 2020."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Feiler-Artinger,25.0,93.0,"Brooding, darkly aromatic fruit plays on the nose. The wild blueberry almost has a floral touch of peony. The palate still contains juicy fruit in a taut, firm structure, while tannins are fine but still crunchy. A bright streak of freshness brightens and guides everything, creating juicness and verve, and giving definition to that lovely, ripe fruit. This wine might take a little time to come out of its shell but is worth waiting for. Drink 2019–2025."
Chardonnay,US,California,Rossi Wallace,25.0,93.0,"A personal wine project of winemaker Ric Forman and his wife, Cheryl Emmolo, this gorgeously rendered, elegant, minerality-driven white offers subtle waves of apple skin, lemon and tangerine. Bright from start to finish, it's well worth seeking out."
Cinsault,US,California,Michael David,25.0,93.0,"Polished, elegant and supple, this offers upfront aromas of plum, strawberry and red cherry. The flavors are pure and fruity, but nicely complex, bringing in light nuances of vanilla, clove and cinnamon to top the cherry and berry freshness. Made from one of the state's oldest Cinsault plantings, this is supremely smooth and sophisticated."
Syrah,US,Washington,Southard,25.0,93.0,"Dark and bloody, this masterfully mixes layer upon layer of detail. Red meat, black olive, cassis and earth roll across the tongue, while hints of flower and chocolate linger in the nose. Complex, tart and earthy, this is as good as it gets in this price range."
Riesling,US,Washington,Pacific Rim,25.0,93.0,"Flinty, with dense citrus rind phenolics, and great length. There are subtle traces of honey, lingering threads that suggest everything from apples to papaya."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Southard,25.0,93.0,"A very seductive nose with both power and flower in full array. The floral components are unusual and show exceptional winemaking talent. Very chocolaty, smooth, with the purity of cassis fruit and the power of fully ripe tannins to back up the barrel flavors. It fades gently into the finish, leaving behind that lovely chocolate and a trail of dark fruits."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sarah's Vineyard,25.0,93.0,"This amazing wine can match up against wines double the price. Brawny red berries and wild cherries mix with cut sagebrush, eucalyptus and crushed graphite on the nose. The palate combines bright red, acid-driven raspberry fruit with the darker structure of elderberry. Throw in thyme and bay leaf for the complete package."
Grenache,US,California,Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,25.0,93.0,"Much more Pinot Noir like in style, this single vineyard Grenache offers aromas of fresh sagebrush, black raspberry, crushed slate and the slightest bit of game. It's light and bright on the palate, yet bolstered by strong and persistently grippy tannins, allowing rose petal and light violet flavors to shine atop the structure."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Domaine Berthoumieu,25.0,93.0,"This is a big, dark wine. It is full of dense tannins and ripe black fruits. The tarry, leathery texture is developing well alongside the black-skinned plum fruits that are cut by intense acidity. Nothing is reticent about this powerful wine. It will be ready to drink from 2019."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tenuta di Fessina,25.0,93.0,"Delicate scents of red berry, blue flower and crushed stone lift out of the glass. The vibrant, elegantly structured palate offers succulent wild cherry, fleshy black raspberry, cinnamon and light baking spice alongside fresh acidity and smooth, supple tannins. A mineral vein gives it precision and intensity."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Gunderloch,25.0,93.0,"Sea spray and salty mineral complexities accent luscious, peachy fruit from nose to finish in this delightfully complex Riesling. It's weightier and more expansive on the palate than a typical Kabinett, but spine-tingling tangerine and lemon acidity lend a fresh, persistent finish. Ready to drink now but should improve through at least 2021."
Sylvaner,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,25.0,93.0,"Enticing scents of white spring flower, orchard fruit, Alpine herb and an intriguing whiff of smoke lead the way on this stunning wine. The elegantly structured radiant palate delivers juicy nectarine, creamy pear and sage framed in tangy acidity. A racy mineral vein further lifts the lingering finish. Drink through 2020."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio de Tares,25.0,93.0,"Leathery aromas of dark berry fruits and various spices comprise a deep and impressive bouquet. This wine is full on the palate, widespread and displays tannic scratchiness. Immense flavors of wild berry fruits and spice end with intensity and firm, sturdy tannins. Drink through 2023."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Calon Ségur,25.0,93.0,"This second wine of Calon Ségur is beautifully proportioned. It is fruity with rich tannins. At the same time, the crisp fruit of the vintage gives a lift to the deep concentration. Let the wine develop over several years. Drink from 2024."
Zinfandel,US,California,Vite Vecchio,25.0,93.0,"This is a 100% varietal, dry-farmed and old-vine wine, peppered in cedar, raspberry and vanilla. It's soft and subtle on the palate, with pretty aromatics and a rich backbeat of juicy fruit. Balanced and with an underlying elegance, it delivers in every way."
Merlot-Tannat,France,Southwest France,Vignobles Brumont,25.0,93.0,"Named after the stone blocks or menhirs which are a part of the Tannat vineyard, this a ripe, open and fruity wine. The Merlot does its job of softening the firm tannins of the Tannat and the blend gives a generous wine that has hints of the wood aging along with spice and acidity. Drink now."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Steindorfer,25.0,93.0,"Aromatic overtones of tiny black elderberries give an edge to the smoky red fruit encountered here. A well-judged, sonorous tone of warm oak runs along the seams, lending structure and framing some floral, peppery notions and plump red cherry of this classy and still very refreshing and bright red. With a little time, its aromatics will develop even further... if you can wait."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Winzer Krems,25.0,93.0,"Lovely spiciness creeps into the lemon and tangerine zest that is on display here. Sprays of freshness and verve continue on the tight, linear palate that leaves a lasting impression of lip-smacking joy."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,25.0,93.0,"Initially closed, this opens up slowly into a very bundled, concentrated yet fluid stream of citrus flesh and zest. There are overtones of kitchen herbs like chervil but lemony freshness trumps. There is a lightness of touch, a wonderful, lithe elegance and a lasting finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta Seara d'Ordens,25.0,93.0,"Produced from a selection of old vines, the wine is structured and dense. It has powerful tannins that are integrated with the dark black fruits and mineral acidity. This is a serious, concentrated wine, solid with its firm structure and with a good future. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Stephen Ross,25.0,93.0,"Not only is this a great bottling at a judicious price, but it also shows a great deal of nuance from the appellation that often brings mostly power. Blackberry, beef, smoked game and pencil shavings show on the nose. The palate brings bright hibiscus and tart elderberry as well as graphite, thyme and bay-leaf flavors."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Caves Velhas,25.0,93.0,"This limited release wine is complex, dense and structured on the palate. It offers a lively contrast between perfumed black fruit and structured tannins, which should integrate well with further aging. Drink this serious wine from 2017."
Riesling,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,25.0,93.0,"From the single vineyard Engelreich—which translates to the angel's kingdom—this is rich, with a concentration of perfumed fruit and intense layers of minerality. It has spice, kiwi and pink grapefruit flavors. This is a wine that needs to age for several years. Screwcap."
Syrah,US,Washington,Eight Bells,25.0,93.0,"The three partners in this new venture have decades of winemaking experience among them, and it shows. With 15% Grenache blended in, the result is a ripe, lightly funky, spicy rendition of Syrah that nicely marries the earthiness to racy wild-berry flavors and a peppery finish. Great length."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Roederer Estate,24.0,93.0,"This is an assertive, flavorful and robust wine, with a medium to full body, a mouthfilling texture and fine-beaded bubbles. A creamy viscosity and wonderful layers of butter, apple, vanilla and ginger make for a delicious palate."
Viognier,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,24.0,93.0,"Sourced entirely from the Sagemoor vineyard, this richly endowed Viognier smothers the palate in a lush mix of fat, candied citrus and tropical fruits. Honeysuckle and orange pekoe tea flavors trickle into the lingering, lip-smacking finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,24.0,93.0,"An opulent feeling Riesling, full of peach and pineapple flavors. It's ripe, full in the mouth and textured, its richness masking the dryness of the fruit and the acidity. It could age a few more years—give it 2–4."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Stéphane Aviron,24.0,93.0,"Produced from old vines in the Côte du Py on the slopes of an extinct volcano, this cru wine is structured with generous black fruits and a series of ripe tannins and balanced acidity. It has the structure and density to age while also having a light touch of black cherry fruit. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sinor-LaVallee,24.0,93.0,"Using fruit mostly from the Bassi Ranch property he recently acquired, Mike Sinor delivers a bright, minerally wine, with aromas of scratched grapefruit skin, orange and peach juice, burned lemons, sea salt, ripe apples and nectarines and fresh-cut herbs. Flavors of salty, lime-juice nectarines emerge once sipped, with hints of butter and white flowers."
Chardonnay,US,California,Zepaltas,24.0,93.0,"Creamy compartments of fig and walnut greet the palate on the entry of this crisp, well-composed Chardonnay, light in oak and bright in minerality. Preserved lemon rises to the fore midway through the glass, befriended by just-sliced pear. The grapes were sourced from Keefer Ranch and Heintz Vineyard, a beautiful expression of the two exceptional sites."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tulpen,24.0,93.0,"A Rhône-style blend that includes Viognier, Grenache and Mourvèdre, this is a standout. It's tight, focused and pure, bearing penetrating flavors of cassis and boysenberry, with streaks of coffee liqueur and chocolate, and a deep, resonant finish marked with fine-grained tannins."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Michel Vattan,24.0,93.0,"This small production wine has a crisp crackly character with great fruitiness, as well as a tight mineral texture from the chalk soil. Its citrus and herbal flavor is balanced with taut acidity. The wine, one of two from this producer reflecting different soil types, is young. Drink from 2019."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Tenuta Roveglia,24.0,93.0,"Made from old vines, this stunning wine opens with heady aromas of ripe apple and fragrant white flower. Round and creamy, the palate delivers Bartlett pear, white peach and nectarine zest alongside fresh acidity. A white-almond note graces the persistent finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Rocim,24.0,93.0,"The 170 acre Rocim estate has produced a serious, dense and powerful wine. It is rich, powered by blackberry and dark plum and damson flavors. The acidity that's there is enough to contrast with the ripe fruitiness while the tannins and layers of wood flavors both promise considerable aging. Drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Shenandoah Vineyards,24.0,93.0,"Powerful, mouthwatering, concentrated black-cherry and blackberry flavors form the core of this full-bodied, full-flavored and well-balanced wine. Starting with aromas of toasted oak and wood smoke, the wine has a broad rich mouthfeel and moderate tannins that propel the gorgeous fruit flavors across the palate and linger a long time on the finish."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Franz Hirtzberger,24.0,93.0,"A beautifully elegant, focused wine, full of racy, steely fruit, managing to combine fullness with lightness and an intensely dry aftertaste. Hirtzberger's 29-acre vineyard is in the western Wachau village of Spitz, where the Rieslings are aged in large acacia wood barrels."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Boeckel,24.0,93.0,"Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours."
Chardonnay,US,California,Loring Wine Company,24.0,93.0,"The nose on this well-priced appellation blend by Brian Loring has it all: golden honey, caramel apple, supple peach flesh, pressed white flowers, fresh yellow flowers and even quinine. The apple-flesh flavors show oak influence in hints of butterscotch and pineapple, yet the mouthwatering acidity keeps it all in balance."
Zinfandel,US,California,Boeger,24.0,93.0,"This is a very complete, well-balanced and satisfying wine that has a firm tannic structure to carry the tempting berry and black-cherry flavors. It starts with light cinnamon, clove and vanilla aromas that join loads of fruit on the palate, layering nicely for an interesting, complex and substantive character. Drink through 2025."
Zinfandel,US,California,Claudia Springs,24.0,93.0,"A juicy, jammy, alcoholic style, tannic and young. This is gutsy, high-toned wine, with fat, extracted fruit. Very dry tannins, good balance. This wine needs time; it's a very different style from the other Claudia Springs Zins. But it shows the same attention to detail, intense fruit, and stylish, sensitive winemaking."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,24.0,93.0,"Very pure notes of Conference pear rise from the glass and promise freshness. The palate reprises the same fruitiness but streamlines it with grapefruit zest and juicy bone-dry concentration. This is bright and sprightly, energetic and invigorating, slender but packed with flavor. The finish is uncompromisingly fresh and dry."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Kenefick Ranch,24.0,93.0,"This is a highly satisfying estate-driven white, impressively crafted in spicy acidity and complex layers of grapefruit. Pithy in its citrus components, it goes on and on, never ceasing to unleash subtle hits of wet stone and a tiny taste of the sea."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Mongarda,24.0,93.0,"Here's a smooth, delicious Prosecco that will satisfy both the novice and the sophisticated wine lover. It opens with lovely aromas of pressed wild flower, apple and a whiff of pastry dough that follow through to the palate along with pear, tangerine zest and a hint of almond. An elegant mousse and crisp acidity offset the creamy flavors. It has lingering bone-dry finish."
Malbec-Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,24.0,93.0,"Full of both fruit and structure, this richly perfumed and spicy wine is impressive with solid tannins that are coming into balance with the rich black fruits. It still needs aging, so drink from 2018. The property is owned by a dedicated wine family that over the years tended the few remaining Malbec vines that survived phylloxera of late 1800s, were founders of the union to protect Cahors wines in the 1930s and helped revive the Confrérie des vins de Cahors. Alain Gayraud is the family's current owner."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Jean-Maurice Raffault,24.0,93.0,"A seven-acre vineyard surrounding an ancient castle, with vines planted in 1938. They give a densely concentrated and powerful wine, with wood and sweet, fleshy red fruits allied to delicious acidity. The whole structure promises long-term aging—give it five years or more."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Sobon Estate,24.0,93.0,"This big, brawny, boisterous wine is firing on all eight cylinders as it generates powerful and concentrated fruit flavors. Rich, warm tannins partner with a thick, velvety texture and lingering finish. It has that exuberant fruitiness of some Zins but with more blueberry and dark chocolate, plus considerable heft and depth. Best through 2023."
Braucol,France,Southwest France,L'Enclos des Braves,24.0,93.0,"This very complete wine displays a fine balance between its tannins, black fruits and acidity. The structure is firm, still dry while giving space for the developing fruitiness. It is almost ready to drink, although it will be better from 2016."
Malbec-Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,24.0,93.0,"An impressively powerful wine that balances the blackest of juicy fruit with dark, dusty and dense tannins. The right amount of wood aging and acidity are in the mix. Harmonious while still concentrated."
Mourvèdre,US,California,La Clarine Farm,24.0,93.0,"There's magic up in Hank Beckmeyer's hills. The Suma Kaw Vineyard in the Sierra Foothills is a prized source for Rhône varieties, where the Mourvèdre typically gets blended in with Syrah, but not here, where it is given room to exude fresh, bright, earthy tones amid an intensity of raspberry, strawberry and just-ripe cherry. A hint of leather surfaces on the finish."
Riesling,US,Washington,Pacific Rim,24.0,93.0,"Just under 10 g/L residual sugar, this Riesling, sourced from vines planted in 1972, opens with a juicy mix of grapefruit, orange and tangerine fruit. Textural and dense, it carries across and through the palate into a lingering, mineral-drenched finish. Superb already, it could be cellared through 2024 or longer."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,24.0,93.0,"Lovely honeysuckle and apple blossoms lead into lush flavors of gooseberry jam, lemon curd and apple butter; the mind reels at the complexity. It's all in perfect balance, the fruit set against bracing acidity, the hint of sweetness rounding out the mouthfeel, and the whole flavor circus rolling merrily along through an extended finish."
Alsace white blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,24.0,93.0,"Brilliant golden color promises richness. The nose obliges with a seamless scent of apples: fresh and ripe, baked and mellow. The palate shows soaring freshness, but countless notions swirl on the dry palate of this traditional field blend: citrus and apple, pear and blossom. There is so much fruit, so much expression, this is pure exuberance, but in a rather grown-up way. A very apt expression of both the freshness and the richness of Alsace."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,24.0,93.0,"Gorgeous minerality is the underpinning of this estate bottling. Heaps of dry extract amplify racy lemon and lime flavors. Despite its low alcohol, this wine has exceptional concentration and power."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Haut-Monplaisir,24.0,93.0,"This is a powerful wine, full of dark fruits and dense dry tannins. Even at four years old, it is still young. It is impressive in its concentration with fine acidity  and black-plum flavors mingling with the tannins. Drink this serious wine from 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Brooks,24.0,93.0,"This is sourced from vines more than four decades old. It's the sweetest of the non-dessert Rieslings from Brooks, with rich flavors of candied citrus, honey and orange marmalade. That said, it's crystal clear, dense, fresh and juicy, and can fill a variety of slots, from an accompaniment to blue cheese, to a wine to pair with fresh fruits and ice cream."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Haut-Monplaisir,24.0,93.0,"Wood aged and serious, this is a finely balanced wine. Its spice and toast notes are beginning to come together with its young, exuberant fruit and acidity. Black currant flavors dominate, giving it a crisp, juicy edge. Drink this impressive wine from 2021."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,24.0,93.0,"The natural late harvest richness of Petit Manseng makes this wine so rich and sweet. Its mango and honey sweetness is balanced by the intense acidity that also comes from this grape. It's beautiful, ripe and delicious now but will be better from late 2018."
Red Blend,US,California,Ancient Peaks,24.0,93.0,"The components of this blend change every year, and this vintage of 93% Syrah, 4% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot shows black cherry paste, crushed purple flowers and vanilla. Juicy blueberry and blackberry decorate the lavish palate, which is lifted by thyme and mint herbs."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,24.0,93.0,"This gorgeous new release, from a young winery with a Riesling focus, is resplendent with an enticing mix of flowers, fruits and stone. The scents well up from the glass and the flavors fill the mouth with a lively zest, pulling together streaks of lemon, lime, nectarine and apricot, accented with citrus rind and wet rock, honey and lemon tea."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,24.0,93.0,"The balance between ripe sweetness and acidity that comes from Petit Manseng shows so well here. There are ripe pineapple and white-peach flavors that are filled out with honey and a dry edge. The wine is delicious now, although it will age and will be better from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Center of Effort,24.0,93.0,"Aged in oak, acacia and concrete, this is a tremendous example of a racy style done well. Aromas of crushed chalk, lightly braised apricot and slivers of cashew are seamlessly woven together, leading into a sip that shows brightness, fine-tuned acidity and structural grip. Rounded pear flavors and lime squeezed on nectarine ensure that it doesn't dive into sourness."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,24.0,93.0,"Mature winter apple, oatmeal and the intricate aromas of dark pine honey give a complex, rich nose to this crémant. The honeyed notes become more pronounced with air and create a thrilling counterpoint to the streak of lemony freshness that pervades the palate. The mousse is integrated, fine and soft while the autolysis lends layers of brioche, oatmeal, earth and yeast. It has backbone, character and a beautifully long finish."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,San Giusto a Rentennano,23.0,93.0,"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious."
Vermentino,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Vigne Surrau,23.0,93.0,"Creamy and delicious, this beautiful white offers aromas and flavors of juicy pear, ripe green apple, white almond, sea salt, wild herb and ginger. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,23.0,93.0,"While the wine is rich and seriously textured, it has a pure fruitiness that is beguiling, ripe and full of green and citrus flavors. Spice and minerality give a strong sense of structure and ageability. Drink this firm wine from 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,23.0,93.0,"With 12 months wood aging, this powerful wine has managed to keep a great sense of balance. Solid tannins are tempered by a more dusty texture, smooth black plum fruits, rich, concentrated acidity and juicy final fruitiness. Drink from 2018."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,23.0,93.0,"Get to know the local red grapes of Gaillac that make up this blend: Duras, Braucol and Prunelard. Together, they create impressive structure, concentration and intensity. Acidity balances the bold red fruit and ripe cherry flavors. It's a serious wine with good potential and will be best from 2020."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta Le Calcinaie,23.0,93.0,"Floral and fruity, this opens with aromas of yellow wild flower and ripe orchard fruit. The bright rounded palate offers mature yellow apple, yellow pear and a hint of candied lemon drop alongside fresh acidity."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,23.0,93.0,"A hint of smoke plays about the nose; likewise, the palate is restrained. This tight, closed wine requires time to let ripe and concentrated pear fruit and lime appear. This long zesty grapefruit finish promises future pleasure. Drink as of 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Sagrado,23.0,93.0,"From a great Douro vintage, this is a ripe wine, packed with generous fruit and concentrated tannins. Berry flavors and juicy acidity dominate a wine that has plenty of power while keeping elegance and stylishness. Drink now."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,23.0,93.0,"Heady peach is joined by a tart notion of citrus foliage. This exquisite aromatic quality of the nose carries throughout the taut but generous body. Despite dryness, luscious peach and red-cheeked mirabelle plums are evoked in a very pure honest fashion. This is the bounty of 2015 displayed with a very light touch, with finesse and elegance. Drink now through 2027."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Efeste,23.0,93.0,"This wine bursts from the bottle with rich and appealing fragrances and flavors of grapefruit, pineapple and citrus. Tart and expressive, it seems to gain extra dimensions from fermentation with wild (native) yeasts. It holds a floral character that is most intriguing."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,23.0,93.0,"This wine comes from the stony slopes above the river Tarn, 45 minutes northeast of Toulouse. That gives it its strongly mineral texture and powerful tannins. A blend of rare and local Duras, Braucol and Prunelard grapes, it's firm and structured while also full of great black fruit and potential. Drink from 2021."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Pôpa,23.0,93.0,"A richly spicy wine, showing its wood aging in the mint flavors as well as toast. Despite a dodgy harvest year, the wine has the dense, ripely fruity character that comes from winemakers João Menezes and Francisco Montenegro's use of foot treading and fermentation in open stone lagars and that gives great black fruits and soft tannins. This is a wine that is powerful and concentrated, ready to age for a few more years. Drink from 2020."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Quady North,23.0,93.0,"Sharp and focused, with fine-tuned varietal expression, this is flat out loaded with rich fruit flavors. Orange, lime, pineapple and pear can be found, all beautifully polished. It's ripe and precise without being bitter or hot, and a fine value as well."
Red Blend,Italy,Central Italy,Adanti,23.0,93.0,"Structured yet elegant, this blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino and a drop of Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a medley of sensations including crushed blue flower, black cherry, blackberry, ground white pepper, savory herb, graphite and cinnamon-spice. It's impeccably balanced with fresh acidity and firm but refined tannins. Drink through 2020."
White Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Hans und Christine,23.0,93.0,"Candied apricots, blossom honey and notions of orange zest take turns in dazzling the nose and palate, while musky botrytis lends a rounded note to the mouthfeel, melding all together into sweet BA harmony. Simply lovely, now or in future years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,23.0,93.0,"Almost black in color, this is a powerful and concentrated wine. Named after the barn owl that is found in the woods around the vines, it is packed with dense and dry tannins. Acidity comes from the black currant fruit while perfumes come from the Touriga Nacional in the blend. Drink this complex wine from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Fouassier,23.0,93.0,"The name, referring to the flinty soil of the vineyard, says it all. It is a mineral wine that tastes of stony soil, flint and chalk. It has a great core of hardened steel, very firm, surrounded by intense green fruits, filled with apple juice and grapefruit flavors. For aging over 2–3 years."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,BiancaVigna,23.0,93.0,"Delicate scents of white spring flower and white stone fruit curl out of the glass. This is loaded with finesse, delivering creamy white peach, green apple, pear and citrus. Vibrant acidity lends balance while an elegant perlage gives it an irresistibly silky texture."
Sirica,Italy,Southern Italy,Feudi di San Gregorio,23.0,93.0,"Intense violet, dark berry, ground pepper and a whiff of leather are some of the aromas you'll discover in this radiant wine. Concentrated and delicious, the palate brings flavors of blackberry, black cherry, clove and tobacco, while fresh acidity and velvety tannins provide balance. Soft but structured, it's already tempting, but wait a few more years for added depth."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Angel Vine,22.0,93.0,"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Antico Colle,22.0,93.0,"Here's a classically crafted selection, with a lovely floral and earthy fragrance. The palate shows dark-plum and black-cherry flavors laced with white pepper, mint and balsamic accents. While it has tame acidity, it's still tightly wound and needs just a few years to soften and develop additional complexity; drink after 2015. Vi Wines, J & J Importers."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lilian Ladouys,22.0,93.0,"While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance. The acidity, dark berry fruits and a fine juicy character go with the firm tannins and spicy wood character. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,US,California,Stolpman,22.0,93.0,"This Syrah, which is enhanced by 15% Petit Verdot, is one of the better wines from the region on the market for less than $25. Awesome aromas of pepper, blackberry and charred beef are intense and deep, while the palate is lifted by bountiful acidity and flavors of boysenberry, white, black and green peppercorns, incense and sagebrush."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Vincens,22.0,93.0,"Almost black in color, this is a dark-hued, black plum and chocolate flavored wine. It is powerful and very concentrated, densely tannic as well as fruity. There is a dusty texture, a fine stratum of acidity and strong wood-spice flavors. The wine is for long-term aging. Drink from 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,22.0,93.0,"The very slightest touch of honey plays among the citrus notes on the nose. There is a touch of yellow pear but the streamlined palate is guided by a seam of lemon zest, smoke, pear and citrus keep echoing each other beautifully. Will benefit from two to three years of bottle age."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Schoffit,22.0,93.0,"A vivid freshness rises from the glass, recalling the wet stones of a cool brook. The palate has a rounder aspect of ripe citrus and is imbued with the tantalizing bitterness of grapefruit and tangerine peel. The body is smooth and concentrated, anchored in freshness and that animating pith. Very moreish, but in an advanced adult way. The finish is whistle clean, lip-smacking, dry and moreish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Mouchão,22.0,93.0,"A blend based on Alicante Bouschet, this ripe and rich wine is appropriately dark in color. It is a firm wine, full of juicy black plum fruits and dense tannins. With weight and considerable richness, it is a complex wine that is developing slowly but surely. Drink from 2018."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Ardenvoir,22.0,93.0,"The second edition of Chateau Rollat's Ardenvoir Sémillon includes eight percent Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, a nice addition that tightens up the mouthfeel. Barrel fermented, it's bursting with rich tropical fruit flavors, Meyer lemon, sweet toasted cracker and caramel, an exceptionally concentrated and full-bodied wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Cissac,22.0,93.0,"Owned by the Vialard family, this is a very fine wine. While it does have strong wood flavors at this young stage, they are going to be there to support the ripe jammy fruit. The wine from this 111-acre estate is generous and is going to age well. Drink from 2022."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Kenwood,22.0,93.0,"This wine showcases the producer's historical devotion and prowess with the variety, leaving a light-bodied impression of floral honeysuckle, wet stone and succulent peach. Fleshy and creamy, it works on every level, and offers value at the same time."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Willm,22.0,93.0,"It is lemon that constitutes the beginning, middle and end of this alluring wine. The first bright freshness flashes on the nose. The absolutely dry palate then becomes enveloped in the incisive, bright and invigorating fruit and zest of ripe lemon, providing direction and litheness. The finish is moreish and lip-smacking with the zesty freshness. You simply want more. Drink 2017–2027."
Riesling,US,Washington,Pacific Rim,22.0,93.0,"The new release from this old (1972) vineyard boosts the alcohol to 13.9%, dropping the residual sugar to just over 1%. Deep, concentrated, and driven by a dense minerality, this exceptional single-vineyard Riesling has raw fruit flavors of green apple, white peach and citrus rind. Sure to evolve, perhaps over decades, it has the vivid acidity and penetrating finish to improve significantly."
Chardonnay,France,Alsace,Boeckel,22.0,93.0,"Chalky, stony notes come to the forefront on this austere, restrained, non-dosed vintage crémant. The taut texture carries green apple and citrus tones, with a satisfying, savory soy sauce backdrop. This is poised and precise, fresh and refreshing, clean and structured—a testament to the nobility of Chardonnay."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weixelbaum,22.0,93.0,"With the appetizing scent of lemon-spiked pear sorbet, it delivers breezy refreshment. A tight, linear body is displayed against a mineral backdrop. The finish is softer than expected, like a caress."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaines Dominique Piron,22.0,93.0,"This is a very fine expression of this always richly structured appellation. It is still young, dominated by firm tannins as well as dark black fruits and the spice of wood aging. The acidity, the black cherry flavors and the density of the wine all suggest its great potential. Drink from 2020."
Rosé,US,California,Quivira,22.0,93.0,"This Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre rosé is a stunning marriage of flavors and textures. Salmon in color, it invites with apricot, peach and Meyer lemon fruit, zesty acidity underlying its flavor, complexity and length."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Wieninger,22.0,93.0,"Initially subdued, the fresh-fruited ripeness of yellow Mirabelle plums and almost an aloe-vera-like scent lead the way, on the palate there is a streamlined but nonetheless nutty,almost smoky, rounded richness with a pleasing lick of freshness. Hazelnuts, wet pebbles and yeasty lees provide an additional dimension to this concentrated, sophisticated wine. This has mileage and will develop over the coming five years."
Mourvèdre,US,California,La Clarine Farm,22.0,93.0,"Wow. An incredible (and affordable) example of what Mourvèdre can be in certain nooks and crannies of the Sierra Foothills and in certain hands. Here winemaker and owner Hank Beckmeyer has made a silk mountai wine out of a tough vintage, taking organically farmed Mourvèdre from the folks over at Cedarville (who have their own label too) and made a gorgeous, pure and rich Rhône with perfumed notes of plum, smooth spice and a good dose of earth, all easy on the palate with fresh acidity and a velvety texture. Very little sulfur was used."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Brick & Mortar,22.0,93.0,"This is made from Pinot Noir grapes grown in two unlikely places in the Napa Valley: the Foss Valley near Atlas Peak and Spring Mountain. There is incredible deliciousness going on in this ever-so-lightly hued wine that is vibrantly crisp in grapefruit rind and earthy cranberry and raspberry. With the slightest salinity on the back palate, it remains thirst-quenching and memorable from start to finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,22.0,93.0,"Ripe pear and yellow plum vie for prominence on the nose, while the palate is full of savory, peppery kitchen herbs like chervil, lovage and dried sage. The midpalate phenolic texture destines this for the table where it will shine with subtly spiced dishes. Wonderfully complex and long."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,22.0,93.0,"A strong whiff of new French oak hits the nostrils when this is first opened, but with some airing it develops into an excellent, deeply concentrated Chardonnay. Apple, pear, melon and papaya flavors are all in play, with enough natural acidity to keep the wine lively and fresh. The finish has ample toast, and rolls along through a smooth and satisfying conclusion."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Château de Ségriès,22.0,93.0,"This rosé is mouthfilling and round, with ample melon and berry fruit, a sprinkling of dried spices and minimal herb notes. It actually drinks almost like a red wine for its weight and berry-scented richness, but remains refreshing on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now."
Albana,Italy,Central Italy,Tre Monti,22.0,93.0,"Fermented and left on the skins in amphora for 120 days, this alluring orange wine offers an array of intriguing aromas including saline, dried yellow stone fruit, baking spice and honey. The vibrant, savory palate continues to open up in the glass, doling out dried apricot, candied orange zest, aromatic herb, tobacco and candied ginger alongside racy acidity. A flinty mineral vein backs up the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,22.0,93.0,"A funky yeasty richness still lingers on this very young wine, the palate, however, shows all the promise of a concentrated yet refreshing wine: there is ripe, juicy pear flesh at the core, framed by zesty lime that swings with the peppery freshness of arugula and watercress. This is full of life, concentration, charm and refreshment."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,22.0,93.0,"Like all the wines from this domaine, this comes from biodynamically produced grapes. It is part of a series of wines named after the subsoil in which the vines are planted. The wine is tense, mineral and still young. It has a flinty character along with lemon and grapefruit fruit. There is a salty tang to this wine that really needs to age. Drink from late 2017."
Tocai Friulano,US,California,Palmina,22.0,93.0,"Scents of butterscotch candies, vanilla custard, apple mousse and sea salt greet the nose in a subtle manner on this wine by Steve Clifton. The palate is framed with bright acidity and tight minerality, with almonds and pecans slowly emerging toward a dynamic finish of white truffle and nectarine. It's a very intriguing, lovely wine."
Red Blend,US,California,La Clarine Farm,22.0,93.0,"Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer goes where his vinous muses take him and this new wine of his is a perfect example of his “why not” attitude. It contains 56% Nebbiolo from the Sumu Kaw Vineyard as well as 30% Syrah from the same, 9% Mourvèdre, 2.5% Viognier and 2.5% Roussanne. It's jam-packed in a lilting way with fresh, bright strawberry and intense aromas of perfume and freshly picked herbs."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,22.0,93.0,"Floral scents greet you at first, a beguiling mix of clover and apple blossom. Pineapple, tangerine and nectarine fruit flavors follow, big and full, finishing with an interesting whiff of almond."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château la Caminade,22.0,93.0,"Toasty aromas are followed by intense black plum fruits twisted with tannins and polished with wood. It's an impressive, powerful wine, with a complex structure. Firm at this stage, it need 4¬–5 years at least to age."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,22.0,93.0,"Dried apricot and dried pear vie for attention. The lifted quality of those dried fruit notes suggests richness but the palate remains firm and guided by zesty, citric freshness. Layered flavors convey candied angelica, vanilla and dried lemon zest, with glimpses of bitter fir honey before a clean, lasting finish."
Trollinger,Germany,Württemberg,Wachtstetter,22.0,93.0,"Trollinger, also known as Schiava or Vernatsch outside of Germany, is a rarity in the U.S. market, but this delightfully crisp, raspberrry-scented bottling is worth seeking out. It releases sweet raspberry and cherry perfume, but also darker notes of smoke, granite and cedar. Cranberry and strawberry flavors are tingling and tart, framed by tight tannins and a deep granite finish. Drinks well now but should improve further from 2021."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Roche-Guillon,22.0,93.0,"Bruno Copéret has produced an impressive wine from this small vineyard on his property. It is still young, full of smoky wood and broad red-fruit flavors. The tannins and the concentration are considerable, although the wine also has a more stylish edge. Drink from 2019."
Zinfandel,US,California,Felten Cellars,21.0,93.0,"Quite light in color, especially for the alcohol level, this wine offers dried red cherries, hibiscus, rose petals, pencil shavings and a touch of hot asphalt on the spicy and fun nose. Lots of lively red fruit energy comes forth once sipped, with nutmeg, clove spice, ginger snaps and molasses flavors rounding out a memorable pour."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,21.0,93.0,"Very ripe aspects inform the nose: ripe honeyed peach and pear dominate. The palate, on the other hand, is a picture of citric slenderness and steely concentration of freshness. Its absolute dryness highlights the brisk, clean and lemon-driven style perfectly. This is wonderfully bracing and cleansing and so very refreshing. Lovely now but sure to develope. Drink now through 2025."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Müller-Grossmann,21.0,93.0,"Savory notes of herb and pine join the scent of ripe yellow plum with the faintest echo of passion fruit. The palate is full of juicy yellow plum toned by lemony freshness. Rounded, fruitful, spicy yet streamlined, this is utterly drinkable, so lay on more than one bottle!"
Tempranillo,US,California,Bokisch,21.0,93.0,"Bokisch has made a Tempranillo that's relatively light in body, bursting with an earthy tobacco tone, with a backbone of leather. The palate feels velvety, with soft but structured tannins, bearing black cherry and dark chocolate flavors. This has to be one of California's best Tempranillos."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Muruve,21.0,93.0,"This ripe, modern red shows all the positives of Toro and the 2009 vintage. Lusty, exuberant aromas of black fruits, vanilla and pipe tobacco are highly appealing, while the palate is muscular and tannic yet balanced. Blackberry, cassis, chocolate and lemon flavors finish firm and bold. Drink through 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Two Vintners,21.0,93.0,"This is a true pan-Washington Syrah, with fruit coming from Discovery, Olsen, Stone Tree, Pepper Bridge, Dineen, Stoney Vine, Yellow Jacket and Boushey vineyards—all top sites rarely seen in a bottle at this price. Scents of smoke, blue and black fruit, crushed flowers, sagebrush and herb leap out of the glass, demonstrating a lot of aromatic complexity. The palate shows intensity, purity and layering."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Bel Air,21.0,93.0,"Jean-Marc Lafont's 2.8 acres of sandstone soil in this area of Moulin-à-Vent has produced a ripe, solidly structured wine. Wood aged and with a rich, tight texture and firm tannins, it is a cru wine to age. It is a bold ripe wine, ready to drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Romain Bouchard,21.0,93.0,"Perfumed and fruity, this shows touches of wood aging, although these are really just hints that lift the fruit. Acidity and a crisp, tangy texture are more important to this wine that bursts with concentrated citrus and green-plum flavors, finishing with so much freshness. Drink from 2017."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine Saint Pierre,21.0,93.0,"This blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah is a terrific bargain. It's full-bodied and creamy in texture yet without excessive weight, featuring complex notes of garrigue and cherries, plus hints of chocolate, cinnamon and clove. Finishes silky and long. Drink now–2025."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,21.0,93.0,"Soft hints of orange zest on the nose give way to joyous, bright and sprightly lemon zest notes on the slender but concentrated palate. Lustrous citrus is expressed with great purity and drive. Freshness and verve is all. What a joy. You feel purified after drinking it. Drink 2016–2026 at least."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Tour de Mons,21.0,93.0,"In the village of Soussans, and in the north of the Margaux appellation, this estate has a fine reputation for its wines. This vintage, with its great balance between fruit and tannins, shows why. It is a ripe wine full of black fruit and with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drink the wine from 2021."
St. Laurent,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,21.0,93.0,"Pepper and cinnamon strike first, before beautifully aromatic notions of blueberry, plum and tart black cherry appear. These scented fruits pervade the entire palate with spice, verve and freshness. A wonderfully poised Sankt Laurent at the perfect intersection of restrained freshness and glorious richness."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Felten Cellars,21.0,93.0,"Buttery-crusted cranberry pie aromas meet with smoked meats, pencil lead and beef jerky on the nose of this private-label wine by longtime producer Stephen Felten, who has more than 40 years of winemaking experience. The palate shows brown flavors, from dried oregano and marjoram to coffee beans and mocha, with a bit of smoked red-cherry fruit."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,WillaKenzie Estate,21.0,93.0,"This wine strikes a resonant balance among mixed tree fruits, sappy acids and leesy, textural highlights that enliven the mouthfeel. The finish brings on golden raisins and a hint of nut butter."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Clément Klur,21.0,93.0,"Ripe and exquisitely pure notes of yellow apple perfume the nose and palate, against a bready, biscuity, rich and complex canvas of autolytic development. Freshness pervades and the very fine, pin-prick of mousse makes these flavors unite and sing. The dryness accentuates both purity and precision of this wine. Real class and pedigree shine brightly and are even more evident in the lingering finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,20.0,93.0,"Coming from a remote estate on the edge of the Lubéron mountains in the north of Provence, this wine is impressively rich. It gains great concentration and structure from the Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah in the blend. Full of ripe red fruits, it is dense at the end."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Mouchão,20.0,93.0,"From the historic Herdade do Mouchão in northern Alentejo, this is a powerful wine, full of dense tannins and impressively ripe, juicy black fruits. Syrah and Alicante Bouschet bring southern richness to Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional. Drink this wine now."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Bibbiano,20.0,93.0,"A lovely, wine, with aromas of red cherry, violet and hints of underbrush. The palate delivers succulent wild cherry, cinnamon and natural vanilla flavors with hint of truffle. It has compelling depth but needs time to tame the structured yet elegant tannins. Drink 2016–2025."
Shiraz,India,Nashik,Sula,20.0,93.0,"The nose carries notes of cassis, blackberry and bell pepper. An approachable, yet complex wine, the palate shows flavors of black cherry, bacon, black pepper, vanilla and espresso bean. Rich tannins linger without burdening the taste buds. Pleasant notes of smoke and salt linger on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beira Atlantico,Quinta de Foz de Arouce,20.0,93.0,"From the coastal plain of the Beiras, this cool and structured blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional has a fine poise between acidity and sweet berry fruits. It's a complex, textured wine. Fresh and fruity on the one hand and dark and brooding on the other, it needs time, so drink from 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,20.0,93.0,"Aloe vera balminess is promised on the zesty, aromatic nose. The palate fulfills this easily: this is supple and flowing, concentrated and fluid. White pepper, grapefruit zest, juicy pear and greenish leafiness all gather around the central seam of freshness. Elegance, poise and total refreshment is the result."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Berger,20.0,93.0,"Zesty lime and green fern aromas rise from the glass. The palate merely adds a little green pear fruit to this refreshing and enlivening combo of utter cleanness and verve. The linearity and drive make this moreish, very exciting and totally lip-smacking. Echoes of pepper on the aftertaste make it even more intriguing."
Chardonnay,US,California,Jax,20.0,93.0,"This is a remarkable effort at the price, the wine sourced from Beckstoffer-owned sites in Carneros. Apple, peach and lemon highlight an integrated, vibrantly fresh experience on the palate, which lingers and impresses long after the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beira Interior,Rui Roboredo Madeira,20.0,93.0,"Structured and still very young, this richly exuberant wine is bursting to get beyond its tannins. The black fruits and dark texture are piled high and laced with intense acidity. It has the mineral character that seems often to appear in wines from the remote, mountainous Beira Interior, giving the potential for considerable aging. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Timothy Malone,20.0,93.0,"This is a deep, intense and focused wine sourced from 40-year-old vines. Its 28 g/l of residual sugar is all but buried in bright acids, creating tension and depth. Grapefruit, lime and pineapple flavors burst through, making this highly cellar-worthy wine irresistible already."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Trimbach,20.0,93.0,"The faintest hint of zesty lemon appears on the nose. The dry palate is of a concentrated slenderness, showing intense notes of ripe lemon zest but hinting at richer notions of ripe pear and candied citron. There is real impact, guided by rapier-like freshness and utter precision. This has an almost cleansing quality but is nonetheless imbued with the fruitful generosity of 2015. Lovely now, but sure to develop. Drink now through 2027."
Viognier,US,Washington,Syncline,20.0,93.0,"A lush mouthful of nuanced fruit, this single-vineyard Viognier is loaded with a rich mix of peach, apricot, papaya and guava fruit. Laced into the hefty fruit core are baking spices and cocoa powder, along with suggestions of curry and cumin. This wine should be mandatory with curry dishes."
Riesling,US,Washington,Efeste,20.0,93.0,"Dry and crisply detailed, this delicious, bracing Riesling combines refreshing minerality with delicate yet complex fruit flavors of apple, pear and tangerine. It's full-bodied and drinking beautifully, but has the structure to develop over a decade or more. You decide whether to enjoy it now or tuck it away."
Red Blend,Italy,Central Italy,Milziade Antano,20.0,93.0,"A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this bold wine conveys earthy aromas of blackberry, leather, tilled soil and a balsamic note. The ripe, creamy palate delivers juicy black plum, cassis, savory herb and baking spice balanced by smooth, velvety tannins. The lingering finish closes on a note of ground black pepper."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,20.0,93.0,"Beautifully pure apple fruit plays on nose and palate. Citrus juice frames the fruit and heightens the freshness even more. If you like a slender, supercrisp style of Riesling, the purity of this will have you hooked."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Anita und Hans,20.0,93.0,"A touch of promising reduction still colors the ripe and aromatic blueberry notes on the nose. The palate shows exactly what makes Blaufränkisch so sexy: that telltale mix of blueberry, cherry and tingling white pepper. Precise in its fruit and fine tannic structure, the wine has purity, toned muscle and verve, with a freshness and illuminating brightness that makes it both fresh and elegant. The finish rings with all the peppery glory of this variety."
Lambrusco di Sorbara,Italy,Central Italy,Paltrinieri,20.0,93.0,"This vibrant, slightly sparkling wine is one of the best Lambrucos out there. Made entirely from the Sorbara variety, it opens with enticing citrus, woodland berry and wildflower scents. Its crisp, delicious palate doles out strawberry and pink grapefruit notes alongside baking spice accents and racy acidity. The lees that have settled at the bottom of the bottle gives the last glass even more flavor."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Capbern,20.0,93.0,"Packed with the dark tannins and structure of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine, produced by the team of Calon Ségur is intense, concentrated and dark. It has a firm structure, solid and with a luscious aftertaste. The acidity of the year just shows at the end. Drink from 2026."
Zinfandel,US,California,Claudia Springs,20.0,93.0,"Zin with a Pinot sensibility; it's bright, spicy and forward. Sweet, delicious fruit, with accents of cinnamon, cardamom and anise. This is an elegant and subtle wine, but unusually long and complex, with wonderful structure. Enticing, enchanting wine."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Dão,Dão Sul,20.0,93.0,"The Dão region has some superb expressions of Touriga Nacional and this is one of them. With its richly perfumed fruit, dusty tannins, spiced damson and blueberry flavors, this is a great wine, ready for drinking in another 4–5 years."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Harper Voit,20.0,93.0,"This barrel-fermented wine drinks like a beautifully proportioned Chardonnay. It takes bright, intense fruit flavors of melon, yellow apples and green bananas, and puts a Burgundian spin on the mouthfeel with judicious acids and a touch of caramel. It's delicious, complex and should age nicely for another five to six years."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Rulo,20.0,93.0,"Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish."
Riesling,US,Washington,Poet's Leap,20.0,93.0,"One of the consistently finest Rieslings from the state, this is technically off dry, but feels dry given its exceptional acidity. Elegant citrus and floral aromas introduce a dense, textural midpalate. A showcase of style and panache, its layered citrus and stone fruits bring both skin and flesh flavors into focus."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Omen,20.0,93.0,"This is an eye-opening wine that shows how good Cabernet from the Sierra Foothills can be. Beautiful deep black cherry and cassis aromas lead to broad generous flavors that instantly expand across the palate and accompany a moderately tannic, elegant texture. Hints of black fig, cedar and mint surround the concentrated fruit core, adding to the wine's complexity."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Chiesa Carlo,20.0,93.0,"Red berry, violet and aromatic herb scents unfold in the glass while the juicy palate doles out crushed red cherry, strawberry, mint and white pepper. Bright acidity and firm, polished tannins provide impeccable balance. Drink after 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Au Contraire,20.0,93.0,"This is a delightfully floral and lemony-crisp wine, with a touch of crème brûlée balanced between layers of citrus. Despite the rich accent, it's light-bodied and easy to like, offering subtle complexity and a sultry, spicy finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Jean Sipp,20.0,93.0,"Hints of dried pear and apple appear on the nose and suggest subtlety but the palate does otherwise: it comes in with bright citrus freshness, recalling lemon oil and candied lemon peel. This is absolutely dry and very sprightly, lively and even exuberant. There is great depth of fruit here that will just evolve. Drink 2017—2030."
Riesling,US,Washington,Efeste,20.0,93.0,"This wine is an aromatic tour de force with notes of apricot, pear, honey and slate. The off-dry fruit flavors are ripe, lightly spritzy and layered, with a drawn-out feel that leads to an explosion of fruit on the finish."
Red Blend,US,California,McClean,20.0,93.0,"Though already four years old, this blend of 77% Zinfandel and 23% Petite Sirah shows lots of promise for a long-lasting wine. Complicated aromas of tobacco and ripe boysenberries become sagebrush herbs on the palate, bolstered by blueberry and elderberry fruits. The tannic grip is still strong, so drink 2018–2028."
Chardonnay,US,California,Au Contraire,20.0,93.0,"This is a pretty, floral and balanced wine, elegantly austere in preserved lemon, yuzu and grapefruit, with richer overtones that build on the medium-body toward the lengthy finish. A wine made for the table, it'll pair well and widely, though it can also stand deliciously on its own."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Vale Meão,20.0,93.0,"The name of the wine comes from the huge horseshoe bend of the Douro River that surrounds the Meão vineyards on three sides. This is the second wine of the estate, ripe with tannins and packed with black fruits. It is developing quickly and is ready to drink now."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château la Reyne,20.0,93.0,"This is a mineral-driven wine, austere at first then showing great black fruits that are sustained by acidity. It's a wood-aged and complex wine that is likely to develop into something powerful and impressive. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,California,Mount Eden Vineyards,20.0,93.0,"Buttered toast, oaky smoke and a slight mango tropicality converge for an epic nose on this Chardonnay from a vineyard that was planted in 1976. There are layers of flavor too, lime citrus at first evolving toward brioche with a butterscotch finish, and some salt and cracked pepper throughout."
Cinsault,US,Washington,Two Vintners,20.0,93.0,"This is a rare, 100% varietal Cinsault from Olsen Vineyard that saw only neutral French oak, and it's hard to imagine a more pure representation of the variety. Aromas of tart red fruit and flowers with high-toned stem accents are followed by piercingly pure, elegantly styled fruit and savory flavors that undulate across the palate. The balance is exquisite. It stands up beautifully on its own but will truly sing at the dinner table. Pair it with lamb."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Airlie,20.0,93.0,"Made from vines planted in 1983, this is dry and textural, with crisp and complex lemon, tangerine and orange peel flavors. It's persistent and fleshy, finishing with a touch of minerality."
Syrah,US,California,Andrew Murray,20.0,93.0,"Perhaps one of the best wines for the money available right now, Andrew Murray delivers aromas of cherry, blackberry, lavender and a white pepper wow factor on the very inviting, florally driven nose. The wine looks silky in the glass, and flavors of black cherry, anise, violet and oregano are easily accessible to a wide variety of palate preferences."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Styring,20.0,93.0,"Ribbon Ridge is making a name for itself as a premier AVA for Oregon Riesling. This rich, mineral-laden wine is scented with orange blossoms and loaded with fruit flavors of Bosc pears, peaches, apricots and a touch of grapefruit. It's big, full bodied, fresh and powerful, and an excellent value."
Syrah,US,Washington,Kerloo,20.0,93.0,"Vibrant aromas of violet, herb, orange peel, smoked meat and plum lead to dense fruit flavors brightened by snappy acidity. It shows uncommon purity and depth that kicks it up a notch, along with enough tannic heft that cellaring will be rewarded. The balance is impeccable."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lynmar,20.0,93.0,"Made from both grapes directly pressed into wine as well as bled off, this crisply complex offering is springtime in a glass, a soft and supple evoking of fresh-cut pineapple that remains dry and delicious without ever overreaching. Medium in body, with a hint of dried herb on the back palate, it offers structure and just the right amount of weight."
Riesling,US,Washington,Poet's Leap,20.0,93.0,"From an especially cool vintage that favored acidity and citrus, this Poet's Leap is a pretty wine, vibrant and full across the palate, with a mix of apple and peach flavors. Clean and balanced, it adds nuances of tea and finally a hint of honey in the extended finish."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,20.0,93.0,"Vines up to 50-years-old are the basis of this rich and tannic wine. While it does have some age, it still has a way to go. Big bold tannins show strongly along with ripe black-plum skins. The wood aging has given this wine a smooth elegant edge that contrasts with the still young fruitiness. Drink from 2021."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Sogrape,20.0,93.0,"A wood-aged wine from the heart of the Dão, it has tannins, a tense mineral structure and layer after layer of black currant fruit and acidity. Dark and brooding at this stage, it needs to age for several years. Drink from 2016."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,20.0,93.0,"The third generation of the Laplace family has produced a black-colored, juicy and richly balanced wine. Its black plum and damson fruit is enclosed in young, firm tannins that will gradually soften. It's a dark, dense wine that will be ready to drink by 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,20.0,93.0,"From 20-year-old vines grown on old stone terraces, this wine is structured and concentrated, yet balanced, with fine red fruits that are layered by tannins and acidity. The wine has a dense texture that gives it depth and ageability. With its structure and rich still-developing fruits, it will be best after 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,South Stage,20.0,93.0,"Joe Dobbes was the winemaker for this Riesling, fashioning an intense and focused wine, with a bit of sweetness but ample acidity to balance it out. It's a deft combination of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon oil and a hint of mint, with impressive length and penetration."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,I Stefanini,20.0,93.0,"Linear and mineral driven, this intriguing white opens with aromas of beeswax, acacia, citrus, stone fruit and a yeasty whiff of bread crust. On the expressive palate, a mineral note underscores juicy yellow peach, nectarine and apple. There's a lot going on and a lot to enjoy here."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Fond Moiroux,20.0,93.0,"Vanilla aromas indicate that wood aging has made an already ripe wine even richer. The tannins are still young, calling for aging, but bold cherry and red plum tones are ripe, full bodied and open. Drink this concentrated wine from 2019."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Provam,20.0,93.0,"This is a rich, smooth and ripe wine. It has plenty of lemon acidity that contrasts with the mineral texture and the melon and pear fruit flavors. The wine is full, refreshing and also likely to age for a few more months. Best to drink this wine from 2017."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Prieler,20.0,93.0,"The nose is still shy and closed. Likewise, the body is taut and will take time to unfurl, but all the structure and promise is already here. This wine is firm and bright, slowly showing dense blueberry notes edged with cinnamon and pervaded by freshness. The structure is firm and still crunchy but with a juicy release. On the finish, white pepper shimmers in the blueberry fruit. Drink 2019–2029."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,19.0,93.0,"Another study in citrus: bergamot peel mixes with fragrant citrus foliage on the nose. The palate brings further harmony with notes of orange and tangerine. The juicy freshness is utterly mouthwatering. The dry, slender palate is seriously playful and playfully serious. Only Riesling can achieve this. Utter joy and supreme refreshment."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Sokol Blosser,19.0,93.0,"This is a powerful wine, with intense scents of pineapple leading a lively interplay of citrus, stone, Asian pear and spices. Thrilling texture, balance and length make this a standout, even in this outstanding vintage for all Pinot Gris."
Chardonnay,US,California,Alma Rosa,19.0,93.0,"Ripe aromas of passionfruit, kiwi and nectarine rise alongside greener elements of celery stalk, wet thyme and Granny Smith apple on this promising early look at the vintage. The tongue tingles throughout the sip, with flavors of crisp apple, yellow melon and crushed chalk. Buttercream appears on the finish."
Blauburgunder,Austria,Burgenland,Meinklang,19.0,93.0,"Juicy, vivid black cherry fruit appears on the nose of this wine, with a touch of tar and brooding elderberry. The palate brims with those appetizing flavors and adds an edge of licorice to the fruit. It's fresh and vibrant, with a fine, taut, gossamer structure. A delicious Pinot Noir that's as elegant as it is refreshing and honest."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,19.0,93.0,"Wiemer's standard dry Riesling is an impeccable value for a wine that offers such density of fruit and minerality. While dry in style, it's a luscious, deeply fruity wine studded with tangerine and stone-fruit flavors glazed in honey and nectar. It's unctuous and ripe, but finishes with a cool, steel-edged persistence."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,19.0,93.0,"This wine's fresh, ripe red cherry and aromatic strawberry touches make for an inviting nose. The palate shows the same intense primary fruit, bolstered by freshness and a fine, filigreed structure. Its supple, pure fruit makes it very enjoyable now, but it's sure to evolve further with bottle age. Drink now–2025."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Gainey,19.0,93.0,"This wine is full of lovely aromas and flavors, but something unique about its grippy texture makes it soar. It begins with fresh, mineral-laced scents of Asian pear, yellow-grapefruit pith, crisp yellow apple and chalk. Then comes a palate full of yellow apple skins, lemon wedge and the slightest hint of grass, all served atop energetic, mouthwatering acidity."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,19.0,93.0,"Powerful tannins are the dominant theme of this still-young wine that is dark, brooding, very firm and young. Big and muscular, this is a wine for long-term aging. Even the black currant fruits need time to soften the intensity of their tannins. Drink from 2019."
Viognier,US,Washington,AntoLin Cellars,19.0,93.0,"This southern Rhône-style blend includes 10% each Marsanne and Roussanne. It's flat out lovely and silky smooth, with scents and flavors of honey-laced flowers. Lemon, lime and grapefruit dominate the palate, with superb balance and persistence. Certainly one of the best Washington State Viogniers I have ever tasted."
Zinfandel,US,California,Boeger,19.0,93.0,"Purely delicious, this has stunning and distinctive aromas and flavors that recall pomegranate juice and blueberries, plus a velvety-smooth texture. While very full bodied, this wine does not win with power but with grace. It has excellent balance and harmony, and stands above the crowd."
Syrah,US,California,Bodkin,19.0,93.0,"There are so many unexpected joys in this 100% varietal wine, given the chance to shine in light-bodied wisps of tangerine, lemon and lime. Despite its delicate nature, it doesn't skimp on satisfaction nor complexity, delivering waves of flavor sip after sip."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Charles Heintz,19.0,93.0,"Sought-after vineyard grower Charles Heintz has teamed with stellar Sonoma County winemaker Hugh Chappelle (Lynmar, Quivira) to make this divine estate-grown Rosé, pale pink in the glass with hugely inviting floral aromatics. From there is a bolt of electricity, the wine juicy and alive in peach, citrus and strawberry, mouthwatering and light."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,19.0,93.0,"Apart from fresh citrus peel and yeasty savoriness, this Grüner delivers a full herbal repertoire of chervil and rocket, watercress and lemon balm. The spine is of lemony acidity, painting a picture of thrilling, concentrated freshness, interspersed with peppery layers of interest and a nearly endless herbal finish."
Syrah,US,California,Bodkin,19.0,93.0,"Nutty, meaty and complex, this crisp, high-toned wine offers food-friendly elegance and refreshment while teasing in savory hints of earthiness. Balanced and dry, it continues to impress as it glides along in the glass."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Barone di Villagrande,19.0,93.0,"Lovely scents of red berry, wild flower and baking spice lead on this elegant red. The radiant palate has tantalizing depth, offering layers of cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg and licorice. Silky tannins and fresh acidity give it an almost weightless texture."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Domaine de Cause,19.0,93.0,"A bold statement of dark Malbec, it's very rich and very concentrated. The wine has considerable tannins to go with the weight of its fruit. With excellent potential, this wine, made from old-vine grapes, should age for at least seven years"
Pinot Noir,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,19.0,93.0,"The scent of very ripe, crunchy Bing cherries is heady at first. On the palate, red cherry fruit dominates the soft, pliant and lighter body, fringed by pleasant earthiness. This is Pinot Noir in a very Central European idiom: Not weighed down with heavy oak but confident enough to let fruit and place speak for itself. This is elegant and soft, light-bodied yet ripe. If you listen to this, it will slowly reveal its undoubted beauty."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,R&A; Pfaffl,19.0,93.0,"An incredibly peachy, fragrant nose is utterly appetising and inviting with oaky softness. The palate shows the same mild, fruit-forward flavor. While the fruit is plump, the wine itself is sprightly and fresh, on very light feet with a wonderfully soft and fresh texture. Right now, the peachy aroma shines."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,93.0,"This is a smooth, impressively rich wine powered by silky tannins and ripe black fruits. The palate is intensely concentrated with a big, bold structure and a solid feel. It does need some aging, so drink from 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Rede,18.0,93.0,"French oak aging has given this still-young wine a firmly structured character, with dark tannins and a firm texture. It's still very dry, structured and dark and needs a good few years to age and round out. For now, the ripe fruit and acidity are both showing great promise. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,US,Washington,Sleight of Hand,18.0,93.0,"This is 100% Riesling, but with less than half the residual sugar of the winery's 2011 vintage. Sourced from the Evergreen Vineyard in the up-and-coming Ancient Lakes AVA, it has great acidity and purity of fruit, along with the minerality for which the region is known. Dense flavors of lime, grapefruit and pineapple are at the core of this wonderfully concentrated, expressive Riesling."
Meritage,US,California,Cameron Hughes,18.0,93.0,"Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot inform the full-bodied flavors in this stunner. It shines in its luxuriously velvety texture, bright red fruit and intriguing elements of graphite and tar. Big and bold, it betrays its size with unexpectedly elegant tension and focus."
Castelão,Portugal,Palmela,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,93.0,"A serious and dense wine, this is rich and full of dark juicy fruit. It has plenty of structure of course, with its rich tannins and wood aging flavors right up front. The acidity is perfumed, underlining the ripe fruit. Drink this concentrated wine from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Smith & Hook,18.0,93.0,"This is a big but balanced expression of Cabernet that is ready to drink now. Layers of black cherry, caramel, vanilla, smoke and crushed black rocks show on the lavish nose. The palate's chalky texture is immediately apparent, with vibrant acidity that carries forth a rich crème de cassis flavor and finishes on roasted coffee and milk chocolate."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta de Chocapalha,18.0,93.0,"Aged for 18 months in wood, this impressive ripe wine is full of fruit and also a firm, smoky tannic structure. The partial fermentation in open stone tanks has given the wine an extra dimension of richness. This is a fine, concentrated wine that is now ready to drink."
Red Blend,Morocco,Zenata,Ouled Thaleb,18.0,93.0,"Aromas of black cherry, espresso bean and white chocolate tease the palate in this Moroccan blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah. Brightness reigns despite powerful tannins, and flavors of black cherry, rhubarb, jalapeño, coriander seed, vanilla and citrus zest are a pleasure on the tongue."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Easton,18.0,93.0,"A Sierra Foothills Sauvignon Blanc with incredibly inviting aromatics of grass, grapefruit and melon that evolves into a delicious texture that's light, dry and yet still somehow rich with crisp acidity. So good for summer and fall."
Riesling,Canada,Ontario,Cave Spring,18.0,93.0,"This is a dry-style Riesling, though it still lends a ripe, fruity impression. Lemon, lime and grapefruit are shuffled into a winning hand, with ample details of cilantro, fennel and wet stone. It's a vibrant, refreshing wine that is immensely food friendly."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Love & Squalor,18.0,93.0,"This packs tremendous flavor into a low-alcohol wine with moderate residual sugar. Peach pit and juice, green apple and citrusy acids start it off. The flavors keep going through a long, complex finish, adding subtle notes of herb and cut grass."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,93.0,"A powerfully constructed wine, it is packed with fruit and tannins. With a leather and spice character, it shows a dry texture while the black plum skin flavors are still developing. The future holds rich fruitiness as well as a solid, concentrated structure. Drink from 2017."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Côtes Rémont,18.0,93.0,"This is a delicious and fruity wine from the smallest Beaujolais cru. There are tannins although they are lost in the generous cushion of ripe blackberry and black-cherry fruits. It is a smooth, rounded wine that is packed with fruit at the moment. Give it time and it will mature well. Drink from 2018."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Bonnet-Huteau,18.0,93.0,"A parcel of 40-year-old vines, this is a full, ripe wine that balances a tangy texture with rich yellow fruits. There is a mineral background along with fine acidity. The wine is impressive, full both of fruit and structure. It is ready to drink, rich and concentrated."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Fischer,18.0,93.0,"There are regular, small explosions of citrus on the slender, taut palate of this exciting Wachau Riesling. This is so lively and energetic that you just want to keep sipping. It is slender, brisk and crisp and leaves the mouth feeling totally clean and invigorated. Not for the faint-hearted but thrilling for true acidhounds."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Fischer,18.0,93.0,"Flinty notes of reduction are top aromas, then citrus-fuelled pepperiness ensues. This is lively, lithe and brisk with lip-smacking freshness and a total refreshment factor. It has the tension of a high-wire. These are Riesling acrobatics in a glass. Bravo."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Navarro,18.0,93.0,"Mendocino's Navarro Vineyards hits it out of the ballpark with this truly stellar Sauvignon Blanc, its 20th year making SB. Partially barrel-fermented, this is an inviting wine of subtle jasmine aromas and touching minerality. An incredibly well-balanced version of the varietal full of lemon thyme and passion fruit. The acidity would cut nicely through a potato gratin."
Riesling,US,Washington,Efeste,18.0,93.0,"Marvelous details of tea, honeysuckle and lemon mark the entry of this exceptional Riesling. It's vivid and textural, with terrific acidity, backbone and length—cellar worthy for sure."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Balletto,18.0,93.0,"Stainless-steel fermented, this crisp, thirst-quenching wine is fruity, floral and highly inviting, focused in well-defined flavors of tangerine and lemon. High in acidity without ever pushing too far, it remains complex and textured on the palate, finishing with a memorable tang."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Selvapiana,18.0,93.0,"Elegant and fragrant, this opens with aromas of pressed rose, crushed violet, wild berry and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant, focused palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry, white pepper, cinnamon and dried herb. It's well balanced, with supple tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2018."
Riesling,US,Washington,Nefarious,18.0,93.0,"For lovers of the bone-dry Riesling style, this exceptional effort could become the poster child. Astringent and crisply defined, with elegant focus, this grapefruit- and citrus-scented wine boasts powerful minerality, estate-grown definition and a resonant, lingering finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,18.0,92.5,"A hearty swirl in the glass wakes up this wine's aroma, showing lemon balm, cress and green pear. Those fresh flavors also play on the lithe palate, where yeasty savoriness is enhanced by lemony spritz. It's totally zippy and refreshing, with far more concentration than is at first apparent, proving it needs time to breathe. A spray of white pepper, lemon and green pear plays on the nose. The spicy palate majors in savory, yeasty notes of white pepper, miso, pea shoot and arugula, all brightened by lemon freshness. The slender and balanced palate is chock-full of flavor and leaves a lasting impression to savor."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Sophenia,30.0,92.0,"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020."
Vidal,Canada,Ontario,Pillitteri,30.0,92.0,"An aromatic knockout with notes of peach, papaya, lychee and brown sugar. At 250 g/L of residual sugar, it's dense and rich with carmelized sugar flavors and a lengthy finish."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,30.0,92.0,"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,30.0,92.0,"This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte. With its rich black fruits and dense tannins, it's also a wine that is firmly structured. Wood aging has added a layer of complexity and broadened out the fruits and dark tannins. Drink from 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,St. Amant,30.0,92.0,"This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork."
Viognier,US,Washington,Charles Smith,30.0,92.0,"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sante Arcangeli,30.0,92.0,"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip."
Chardonnay,US,California,Darcie Kent Vineyards,30.0,92.0,"This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Nefarious,30.0,92.0,"“Rhône times three” seems to be the code name for this classy blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. It takes the best from each grape, creating a rich, pure, high-acid wine with a zingy berry flavor, plus a mineral underpinning and earthy, coffee-soaked tannins."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,30.0,92.0,"Yellow fruits lead off this sophisticated wine. With its creamy texture, overlaid by a more steely texture, it's a wine that has aging potential as well as present fruitiness for early drinking. So age for four years or give in to the freshness now. Screwcap."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Nada Giuseppe,30.0,92.0,"Giuseppe Nada and his son Enrico have produced an earthy and gripping Barbaresco, with floral, truffle aromas punctuated with Alpine herbs. The palate shows layers of dark cherry-berry fruit, balsamic notes of sage and mint, all backed up by a firmly tannic backbone. Best after 2016."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,30.0,92.0,"There's an intense punch of sweet yellow peach on this lip-smackingly delicious Spätlese. Hints of savory spice and struck flint, and a deep, rippling minerality adds complexity and depth through the finish."
Malbec,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,30.0,92.0,"This single vineyard Malbec belongs with Washington's best. The mix of purple fruits and intense barrel flavors of clove, cocoa and dusty mocha inspires an impromptu “wow” once in the mouth. Smooth, satiny and seamless, it has a gentle hint of earth and herb threaded through the finish."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Cristom,30.0,92.0,"This wine is textbook New World Viognier—bright, focused and balanced, with sassy fruit flavors of citrus and apricot. The aromatics conjure up subtle notes of citrus rind and jasmine flowers, and the overall length and concentration are as good as it gets."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Lancaster,30.0,92.0,"Flinty and austere, this is an elegant white wine crafted from 100% Musque clone, dancing in pear and grapefruit. The layered texture impressively stands out, riding the wave between creamy and lemony crisp with precision, opening the door for the wine to finish refreshingly."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Shomron,Madmon,30.0,92.0,"An intense bouquet of blackberry, smoked meat, flint and violet paves the way for flavors of black currant, smoked meat, coffee bean and a hint of cranberry. Rich savory notes mingle with strong fruit flavors, all marked by a pleasingly persistent strain of tartness. Smooth, soft tannins prime the palate for the elegant finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lincourt,30.0,92.0,"There's a very savory, gamy element on the nose of this wine, which shows wild berries, woody shrubs, rusty iron and turned forest-floor aromas. The palate is punchy at first, with decent acidity and cranberry-plum-raspberry flavors, then clings to a pencil-lead core deeper into the sip. It offers quite a bit of complexity."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,30.0,92.0,"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Judean Hills,Psagot,30.0,92.0,"This wine has a bouquet of raspberry, bell pepper, ground black pepper and a whiff of petrol. It fills the entire mouth with flavors of raspberry, cherry, rose petal, caramel, and flint. Offering a touch of salinity, to appeals to the entire palate, peaking with a grippy finish marked by smoke-tinged fruit flavors."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Ca' dei Zago,30.0,92.0,"This elegant sparkler opens with alluring aromas of fragrant jasmine, wisteria and white peach. Thanks to 80-year old vines, the linear palate has both finesse and concentration, offering ripe yellow apple, Bartlett pear, energizing mineral tones and a saline note alongside a creamy mousse."
Viognier,US,California,Meadowcroft,30.0,92.0,"This 100% varietal wine makes the case for Viognier in this appellation, expressing Golden Delicious apple and pear around a fresh, medium build of viscous texture, lemon and wild honey. Pretty and aromatic, it's a classically fine-formed white, made in small quantities."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Canada,British Columbia,Laughing Stock,30.0,92.0,"Essentially a Bordeaux-style blend (just 4% Syrah breaks the mold), this smooth, silky wine is seductive. The blueberry, black cherry and plum fruit has compelling complexity, further enhanced with flavors of coffee and toast from 14 months in French oak."
Syrah,US,Washington,J & J,30.0,92.0,"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine dazzles the senses with notes of freshly roasted coffee, char, dark plum and sweet spices. It's medium bodied with thoroughly delicious coffee flavors backed by a soft feel."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Geyerhof,30.0,92.0,"For now, funky yeast dominates the nose. The palate, however, abounds with friendly yellow Mirabelle plum and mandarin notes, all pulled into beautiful focus by lemon freshness. There is concentration and drive, energy and verve. This is beautiful, impressive and yet friendly and gentle. Lovely balance and aromatic length."
Chardonnay,US,California,Bargetto,30.0,92.0,"There's an immediate pithy tension on the nose of this bottling from a producer in the game since 1933, with Brie-cheese rind, fresh Greek yogurt and and grapefruit-peel aromas. The flavors are intriguing, hard to pin down and alluring, with exotic citrus and varied stone fruit, light honeysuckle and crushed slate mixed with chalky structure. Simmering acidity keeps the flavors coming."
Zinfandel,US,California,Saracina,30.0,92.0,"Saracina makes dazzling white wines, but this intense red is outstanding too. Dark fruits like blackberry mingle with bright raspberry in this hefty, substantial wine that's full bodied and handsomely tannic. It's dry, very textural in the mouth and concentrated well enough for a lingering finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Skinner,30.0,92.0,"This wine gives a big bear hug with aromas like wild berries and black pepper. Then sweet oak and rich, savory plum flavors emerge on the palate as the ripeness comes through. The finish is long and reverberates with the nutmeg spiciness of perfectly seasoned barrels."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Terre Rouge,30.0,92.0,"Ah, this wine is distinctive and practically haunting in personality, as wild, earthy, sage and mushroom aromas meet meaty, savory, mineral-like flavors on a well-balanced frame of good acidity and appetizing, fine-grained tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Forgeron,30.0,92.0,"The grapes come from three very widely separated vineyard sources. The Klipsun, says winemaker Marie-Eve Gilla, is for the backbone and tannins; the Pepper Bridge gives dried herbs and tighter tannins; and the Alder Ridge is more European and fills out the midpalate. This is showing very well, and has clearly benefited from the extra bottle age. It's beautifully integrated, with the tannins substantial but polished. The fruit mixes ripe berries and moves smoothly into flavors of earth, smoke, tobacco and graphite."
Neuburger,Austria,Wachau,Lagler,30.0,92.0,"Breezy, zesty stoniness is overlaid with lemon freshness, suggesting a slender wine. However, the palate is rounded and generous, with layers of red apple, Comice pear, honeydew melon and orange zest. The finish is whistle clean and that counterpoint of breezy freshness and rounded ripeness makes you want to sip more."
Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon,France,Loire Valley,Château la Varière,30.0,92.0,"With new wood dominating this still young wine, it is concentrated and full bodied, packed with firm tannins and dark fruit. There is a brooding character, the wood and tannins still right up front. Give this structured wine at least five years."
Malbec,US,Oregon,Seven Hills,30.0,92.0,"This is another outstanding vintage for Seven Hills Malbec, clearly one of the best in the Northwest. Dark, concentrated and impeccably focused, this mixes raspberry and cherry fruits with threads of smoke, espresso and dark, roasted wood. The tannins are gorgeous—smooth, powerful and stylish to the point of silkiness. Licorice and dark chocolate put the bow on the finish."
Tempranillo,US,California,Di Arie,30.0,92.0,"Wonderful cedar and tobacco aromas, sophisticated cinnamon and dark-fruit flavors, lavish tannins and full body create a gorgeous taste experience. This wine is plush and generous in texture, and exotic and delicious in flavor. It should age well through at least 2020."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Two Vintners,30.0,92.0,"A consistent standout for this winery, the new vintage does not disappoint. Jazzy and jammy red-fruit and spice aromas are followed by rich, plump, beautifully balanced fruit flavors followed by an extended finish. It only ramps up over time. It's a prototype of the variety and about as good as it gets from the state."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Christophe Cordier,30.0,92.0,"This warm, ripe wine offers good acidity, but its main thrust is rich yellow fruits and spice. It is drinkable now, but will develop well over the next few months to give a rounded, generous character. Drink from 2017."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier,30.0,92.0,"This partnership continues to turn out marvelously complex wines from inland Victoria. Savory, herbal and intriguing on the nose, with hints of raspberry, mushroom and smoked meat, this is a medium-bodied, supple wine. Dusty tannins impart a silky quality to the finish. Drink now–2018."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Agostino,30.0,92.0,"This opens with smoky, powerful aromas of black fruit and oak. The palate feels flush, offering several levels of character and complexity. Flavorwise, this pulses with blackberry, cassis and fudge, before finishing with subtle prune, mint and chocolate notes. Not edgy or hard. A blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet and Syrah."
Grenache,US,California,Chalone,30.0,92.0,"Classic and compelling aromas of rose petal, candied boysenberry, hibiscus reduction and vanilla brioche show on the nose of this wine from a rugged appellation east of the Salinas Valley. The firmly structured palate shows rose petals and tart berries, dusted by fennel pollen, white pepper and chaparral spice."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,30.0,92.0,"Dry Riesling of this quality is capable of aging up to two decades, especially under screw cap. this one is medium bodied and dominated at the moment by ripe, citrusy fruit. It's more orange than lime, yet still shows great acidity and length. Drink 2020–2030."
Roussanne,US,California,Jaffurs,30.0,92.0,"This is as well-balanced an interpretation of Roussanne as they come in California—proudly plump but not flabby. Light gold in color, it offers caramelized banana, custard, beeswax and apple blossom aromas. A backbone of lemony acidity runs through the palate, buttressed with ripe melon, mango and more tropical fruit flavors."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Bunchgrass,30.0,92.0,"A blend of Grenache, Syrah and Malbec, this lightly colored wine offers aromas of wild strawberries, coffee, tobacco and incense, showing pleasing purity and nuance. It's light yet palate coating, possessing a mesmerizing texture along with an assortment of fruit and savory flavors."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Fonterutoli,30.0,92.0,"Sangiovese and 10% Merlot are behind this savory red. It opens with aromas of plum, blue flower, forest floor and baking spice. The aromas follow through to the elegantly structured palate, along with juicy black cherry crushed raspberry, clove and tobacco."
Syrah,US,Washington,:Nota Bene,30.0,92.0,"LVdM is shorthand for Les Vignes de Marcoux, a newer planting near Red Willow. Done in a lovely, savory style, it offers a mix of leaf, herb and earth components, rather than supersweet fruit. Graceful and detailed, it discloses pepper and iron ore minerality."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio de Atauta,30.0,92.0,"Appealing black-fruit aromas include notes of tobacco and chocolate. This is a brooding, deep Tinto Fino with grippy tannins. Ripe berry, plum and cassis flavors are flush, while this wine finishes dark, with a reprise of young, rubbery tannins. Best from 2019–2030."
Syrah,US,Washington,K Vintners,30.0,92.0,"This is wonderfully aromatic and forward, with lush fruit-pie flavors of blackberry and black cherry. There are graceful notes sprinkled generously throughout, hinting at peppery herb and anise. At once smooth and supple, long and generous, this is drinking exceptionally well."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey,30.0,92.0,"Savory spiced apple with complex autolytic overtones of stone, oatmeal, soy and baked apple lend a rich, rounded to the nose and palate. There is real character in the classy, slender structure and the lingering taste is satisfyingly clean and long."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Thanisch,30.0,92.0,"Layers of honey and white tea alternate accents of silkly tannins throughout this delicate, pertly structured auslese. The palate is ripe and sweet, yet rippling with acidity, and extending through a long, saffron-kissed finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Yohan Lardy,30.0,92.0,"This is Yohan Lardy's top wine, produced from vines planted in 1903. Dark and dense although shot with acidity, the wine is firm and concentrated. It layers a floral character with minerality and black fruits. The wine needs to age further, so drink from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Brutocao,30.0,92.0,"This seductive wine has aromas of mint and cassis leading to deliciously ripe and complex fruit flavors within a creamy texture. While braced by fine-grained tannins, the wine remains almost silky on the palate, bringing cherry, blueberry and mocha flavors that linger on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Aiguilhe,30.0,92.0,"This balanced wine shows fine potential. Its structure dominates at the moment, with solid tannins, but the rich black fruit is all there. Let it develop over the next several years and drink from 2021."
Petit Verdot,Portugal,Duriense,Quinta da Romaneira,30.0,92.0,"This is classic Petit Verdot in Portugal: dark red, structured and firmly tannic with great fruits. The grape, normally found in Bordeaux, seems to be very much at home in this schist soil and hot climate of the Douro. Its tannins are there, but the blackberry fruit and acidity are just as important. Drink this from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Vermeil,30.0,92.0,"Neutral French oak played a part in this wine's fermentation, giving it weight and substance without distraction. Exotic on the nose, it's fleshy and high toned in guava and lemon zest, with a memorable length of mineral-like stone that gives it texture and complexity."
Loin de l'Oeil,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,30.0,92.0,"The Loin de l'Oeil grape lends itself easily to creating this rich, honeyed wine. It's intense, with a viscous texture and opulent apricot and bitter marmalade flavors. Drinkable now for its concentration, it will get even better from late 2018."
Grenache,US,California,Epiphany,30.0,92.0,"Red cherry, kola nut, root beer, brown spice and a touch of smoke pull the nose deeply into this bottling by Blair Fox and Eli Parker. Baked red and black plum, a touch of mulberry and bloody, earthy flavors mark the palate, which is quite complex and bound together with a strong tannic structure."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Chantegrive,30.0,92.0,"This wood-aged wine, one of the château's top white cuvées, needs to age. With its toast and ripe yellow and white fruits, it is rich and full, a reflection of good whites in a drab red Bordeaux vintage. After a bitter smoky edge from the toastiness softens, it will be a very fine wine. Drink from 2017. This Lévèque family estate is a member of the Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Vienna,Hajszan Neumann,30.0,92.0,"The nose evokes the idea of freshly cut red and yellow apple peel, drizzled with lemon juice. On the palate, there is a hint of a slightly bitter edge, like that of honeycomb. But it all remains lightbodied and sprightly and very energetic, even stony. The pure, long finish is a joy on this typically Viennese field blend."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Galerie,30.0,92.0,"Beautifully balanced and elegant, this is made by one of the winemakers at Cardinale and inspired by the Loire Valley. It offers equal parts fruit, weight and minerality, tasting of fresh-squeezed lime and wet stone, with a layering of viscous vanilla. Medium-sized in terms of texture, it dances on the palate, refreshing throughout."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Pellegrini,30.0,92.0,"Silky smooth and delicate, this comes from a long-standing family-run winery in the heart of the appellation. It's a subtle, floral wine offering layers of dark plum and strawberry. Medium-weight and tangy in acidity, black tea and toffee notes linger on the finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Vindemio,30.0,92.0,"Mainly Grenache (80%, the balance is Syrah) aged entirely in tank, this wine features loads of superripe dark cherries and plums, yet with a savory, olive-and meat-tinged aspect as well. Full-bodied, with a velvety texture and a long finish, it should drink well through at least 2016."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Peique,30.0,92.0,"This is intense in both color and aromatics. Potent scents of black fruit, animal hide, graphite and bold oak are at the fore. It feels pure, lush and well built, with dark flavors of blackberry, chocolate, toast and spice. Coffee and pepper are the prime finishing flavors; drink now through 2015."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,I Veroni,30.0,92.0,"Made entirely from organically grown Sangiovese, this opens with red plum, new leather and underbrush aromas. The full-bodied palate delivers crushed raspberry, black cherry, pipe tobacco and a hint of black pepper, with polished tannins providing backbone. Drink through 2022."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Saint-Rémy,30.0,92.0,"There is a whole orchard full of apples here: crisp and green, yellow and juicy, red and mellow and also the very aromatic red-cheeked kind. These aromas fill nose and palate and present a wonderful balance between fruity richness and absolute zesty freshness. This is lissom, dry and light bodied but full of flavor with a very mellow apple finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,30.0,92.0,"The nose is subdued at first but then opens up into ripe apple notes with the zesty spice of grapefruit rind. The palate is dry and concentrated and adds a riper notion of juicy yellow plum while a bright lemony citrus streak keeps everything taut and lively. This is joyful, subtle and fresh and finishes on a pure apple note."
Zinfandel,US,California,Amador Cellars,30.0,92.0,"Well-integrated oak, deliciously ripe fruit flavors and an absolutely luscious texture make a great combination for this very full-bodied wine. The entry is smooth and light, then the flavors of ripe plum and boysenberry build on the palate, very mouth filling and rich, before lingering on a long finish."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio de Tares,30.0,92.0,"Deep, dark and oaky smelling, with tons of mocha on top of ripe black fruit aromas. There's both heft and elegance to this wine, that and coffee, spice and exotic black fruit flavors. Finishes toasty and spicy, with a rich, chunky, structured feel. Impressive; drink now through 2013."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Obsidian Ridge,30.0,92.0,"Attractive, spicy oak perfume and plush, concentrated fruit flavors rest on a luxurious and velvety texture in which fine tannins seem to melt into the ripe blackberry and cassis flavors. The wine is full bodied, layered, very broad and mouthfilling, with a long finish."
Syrah,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Vidal,30.0,92.0,"This brooding, dark Syrah is medium to full in body, built upon layers of of firm, dusty tannins. Intense blackberry and hickory smoke notes fill out the flavor profile. The chewy tannins come close to being overdone, but mouthwatering stone fruits save the day on the lingering finish. Drink 2018–2028."
Zinfandel,US,California,Trinitas,30.0,92.0,"This wine has peppery, meaty aromas, good flavors that meld beef with berry, and a rich, mouthcoating texture. It's full bodied, very ripe but not sweet, and it encourages one sip after another."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Chenevières,30.0,92.0,"This is one of the coolest premier crus, meaning that the wine can often age well. In the warm 2015 vintage, the wine shows both beautifully ripe fruit and a tight mineral streak that will keep it on the straight and narrow. It does need to age and the wine will be best from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Campolargo,30.0,92.0,"A fascinating blend of five varieties, this solid, black wine shows structure, dense tannins, an enticing perfume and big, ripe fruits. The finish has acidity, but also those powerful tannins. Age for 4–5 years."
Syrah,US,California,Terre Rouge,30.0,92.0,"Another small-production stunner from Terre Rouge, this Syrah is still young and tight but potentially potent. The wine opens with notes of white pepper and mushroom, dirt and earth, delving from there into herbs and plenty of berries. Very savory it will pair deliciously with Gruyère, bacon and mushroom, preferably all together in a quiche or tart."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Efeste,30.0,92.0,"This is concentrated and complex, with hints of flower, citrus flesh and rind, gooseberry and chamomile. It's labeled Columbia Valley but the Evergreen Vineyard, from where the grapes are sourced, sits in the heart of Washington's next likely American Viticultural Area—Ancient Lakes."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Niepoort,30.0,92.0,"An impressive wood-aged wine that offers a rich, complex series of ripe yellow-fruit flavors, a steely texture and layers of wood toast. It is finely balanced, a wine with great style, spice and final acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Muxagat,30.0,92.0,"This wine, with its black color, barely escapes being too much. Initially, it seems too rich, too concentrated. But slowly its more elegant character, ripe and smooth, comes through. The acidity gives surprising freshness considering the weight and density. It does need time, so drink from 2017."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Domaine Bousquet,30.0,92.0,"Herbal notes of pine and eucalyptus rest on top of a bedding of spiced cherry and cassis aromas. This Malbec blend is firm and structured, with no weaknesses around the edges or in the middle. Ripe blackberry, spice, mocha and molasses flavors finish toasty but alive. Drink through 2021."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,Shaw,30.0,92.0,"This concentrated Pinot Noir calibrates power with finesse, juxtaposing rippling black cherry and berry flavors against complex mineral and earth tones. It's luscious and layered in mouthfeel, enriched over four years of extended lees contact. While decadently delicious now, it has enough structure to age elegantly through 2019–2021."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Romaneira,30.0,92.0,"Aged for 14 months in wood, this wine is smoothly structured and offers considerable dark fruits and rich tannins. It has power and concentration from the texture and the fruit. It is an ageworthy wine from a great estate. Drink from 2018."
Malbec,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,30.0,92.0,"This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Dão Sul,30.0,92.0,"A big, ripe earthy wine, layered with tannins and dark black fruits. It has density and concentration, while keeping a sense of freshness and balance. A powerful and impressive wine that will age well."
Zinfandel,US,California,Mesa Del Sol,30.0,92.0,"Deep aromas of black-cherry syrup meet with raisin, leather and fudge on the rustic but inviting nose of this dessert bottling. It's sweet and lavish on the sip, but with impressive grip, showing strawberry and cherry-sauce flavors along with cinnamon and clove spice."
Merlot,US,Washington,Obelisco Estate,30.0,92.0,"Estate-grown, spicy and fresh, this exciting wine from a new Red Mountain producer shows outstanding potential. Carefully crafted by the winemaking team of Pete Hedges and Sarah Goedhart, it's stylish, European, sleek and polished. The fruit is spicy and bright, the barrel accents just right, the tannins smooth and supple, and the length surprising. A fine effort."
Grenache,US,Washington,Nefarious,30.0,92.0,"This is the first Grenache from Nefarious, and it's a beauty. Sourced from the Upland vineyard in the tiny Snipes Mountain AVA, it is bursting with pure, sweet fruit flavors, tart and lip-smackingly juicy. A subtle minerality with a hint of wet cement gives it tannic authority, while the aging in once-filled French oak barrels adds a touch of baking spices."
Merlot,US,California,Westerly,30.0,92.0,"Incredibly rich and delicious aromas of vanilla, scotch, blackberry jam, strawberry preserves and cola get a dash of added intrigue from the green hint of pasilla chile. The palate shows dark chocolate and blueberry-boysenberry juice, proving very rich but not overly dense in mouthfeel."
Syrah,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de la Concordia,30.0,92.0,"Ripe berry, raisin and Maduro cigar aromas are hefty and convincing for Spanish Syrah. This feels full, with bracing acidity. Flavors of cassis, plum, chocolate and tobacco are steady as a barge on calm water. This is impressive for varietal Syrah from Spain. Drink through 2021."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Rocland Estate,30.0,92.0,"This full-bodied Shiraz starts off plummy, with oak-derived accents of smoke and vanilla. Those elements also show up on the palate, picking up additional notes of blackberry, cedar and baking spice. The texture is velvety, and the finish is long and surprisingly elegant. Drink now–2025."
Lambrusco di Sorbara,Italy,Central Italy,Paltrinieri,30.0,92.0,"Violet, red rose, wild berry and chopped herb aromas abound on this fragrant sparkling wine. Made with 100% Sorbara gapes, the luminous, copper-toned palate offers ripe strawberry, crushed raspberry, wild cherry, nectarine zest and a note of baking spice alongside tangy acidity and a firm, persistent perlage. This puts a whole new spin on Lambrusco."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Companhia das Quintas,30.0,92.0,"This is a superripe wine full of rich black fruits and solid tannins. It blends Touriga Nacional with a whole raft of other grapes including Petit Verdot and Merlot. Together this blend gives a powerful wine, dense and full-bodied, that will need aging. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Adelsheim,30.0,92.0,"In ‘99 Adelsheim bottled two separate clonal selections; this year they have elected to combine the two. This lovely, young wine, with very ripe, tight fruit, is already showing a bit more peach, apricot and tropical scents than the previous vintage. This is a concentrated, complex and powerful style, which harnesses the oak rather than being driven by it. Delicious and exceptionally long."
Viognier,US,California,Baiocchi Wines,30.0,92.0,"A deep yellow-gold color and rich aromas of fig, marzipan and pear indicate this will be a concentrated, full-bodied wine, which it is. Flavors layer peach, pear and toasted almond. The texture is very creamy and smooth, and the finish lingers a long time. It's a great example in the full-bore mode."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine du Chalet Pouilly,30.0,92.0,"Rich fruit is boosted by the wood aging. Together they give a ripe wine full of acidity and juicy yellow fruits at the same time. It's a delicious wine, smooth while lined with acidity. The wood flavors sustain it, and it should be ready to drink from 2016."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Colombera & Garella,30.0,92.0,"Here's a savory, focused red made with 80% Nebbiolo, 10% Croatina and 10% Vespolina that opens with aromas of dark berry, tilled soil and crushed aromatic herb. The delineated palate offers black cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper, anise and sage alongside firm but polished tannins. It shows depth and breeding. Drink through 2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Ramos-Pinto,30.0,92.0,"Duas Quintas Reserva is now established as one of the benchmark wines in the Douro. This dark-colored effort has ripe, concentrated dark berry and herb flavors and a fine sense of tannic structure from wood aging. There's a strong sense of minerality as well, giving this richness and aging potential."
Syrah,US,Washington,Woodinville Wine Cellars,30.0,92.0,"Stillwater Creek grapes anchor this outstanding Syrah. Rich cherry flavors, generously awash in cut tobacco and vanilla, gain extra complexity, with hints of smoke and a streak of dusty earth. It's clean, with good grip, and a long, smooth finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Chateau Les Amoureuses,30.0,92.0,"Another tiny cuvée from Amoureuses (80 cases produced), this one blends 40% Syrah, 35% Grenache and 25% Merlot. Toasted-coconut oak scents lead the way, followed by oodles of black plums and cherries, a splash of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. It's full bodied and velvety textured; rich, like dessert without sugar. Drink now–2025."
Rosé,US,California,Limerick Lane,30.0,92.0,"A perennial knockout, this wine continues to impress. The estate-grown grapes are picked specifically to make a bone-dry refreshing palate pleaser that's pretty in pink and orange tones. Tart, crisp and broadly appealing, it's an effortless experience dripping in grapefruit and blood orange."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,30.0,92.0,"The name refers to the fact that Madiran is on the Greenwich Meridian of zero degrees longitude. The wine, from a single parcel, is bold and black in character and color. It is firmly tannic, with plenty of balancing acidity, but the tannins are sweet, now softening into the superripe fruits and chocolate flavors. It will fully mature in the next 2–3 years."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Jacques Charlet,30.0,92.0,"A mineral and ripe wine, full of yellow fruits along with a tight, steely texture. The combination gives the wine structure and richness, offering ripe complexity and the potential to age."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,Bellwether,30.0,92.0,"Bellwether's single-vineyard Pinot stands out for its gorgeously lifted, blossomy perfume. The palate is a cherry bomb of flavor, yet elegantly framed by a razor's edge of acidity and soft, feathery tannins. Drinks beautifully now, but will be a joy to mature from 2020–2025."
Monastrell,Spain,Levante,Crápula,30.0,92.0,"Aromas of rooty berry, loamy dark plum and minerally crispness create a fine nose that offers notes of coffee and char as it unfolds. The palate on this Monastrell is widespread and grabby, with baked blackberry, raspberry and plum flavors. Chocolate and spice notes ride high on a comfortable finish. Drink through 2018."
Barbera,US,California,La Folia Winery,30.0,92.0,"A 100% Barbera that invites with gorgeous aromas of cinnamon and baked cherry, this is a lovely wine from start to finish, with a silky texture and balanced acidity. Seamless, it's juicy on the finish, the perfect invitation to enjoy more. Have with spaghetti carbonara or a seriously gourmet pizza."
Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,30.0,92.0,"Fresh red apples and juicy, ripe pears beckon on the nose at first, then peachiness shines through. On the palate it's even riper with a satisfying heart of fresh and baked apples and a rounded, almost bouncy structure that has some thing celebratory and joyous about it, with lots of lively freshness, zip and length."
Sparkling Blend,US,Washington,Syncline,30.0,92.0,"A blend of 58% Pinot Noir and 42% Chardonnay, this light copper-colored wine is über aromatic with notes of passion fruit, guava and strawberry. As sweet as the aromas smell, the palate drinks bone dry with abundant brioche flavors, exquisite balance, and a long, lingering finish. Sourced from Celilo Vineyard, this is a hugely impressive wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Bel-Air,30.0,92.0,"From a selection of vines, this is a powerful, complex wine that boasts ripe tannins, sweet acidity and a juicy black currant character. It has structure and density that certainly indicate aging, so keep the wine for at least five years."
Sangiovese,US,California,La Folia Winery,30.0,92.0,"A buzz is building around Calaveras County-based La Folia, and this lovely wine shows why. Opening with a subtle oaky aroma, it evolves to offer a lightness of color and texture, enveloped by delicious highlights of cherry and cranberry fruit. Well integrated and well structured, this Sangiovese ends with a long and satisfying finish of violet-inflected plum."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,30.0,92.0,"Concentrated citrus fruit sings on nose and palate. The body reveals a stony, mineral texture of exquisitely clean dryness. There is the slightest edge of pleasant bitterness, just like in dried lemon peel. Linear, concentrated with lots of citric backbone. Drink 2016–2025."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Cristom,30.0,92.0,"Barrel-fermented in stainless steel and neutral oak, this aromatic wine rolls into a gorgeous palate loaded with rich fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and Meyer lemon. There's a suggestion of softness to the acids, and a lick of butterscotch runs through the finish. It's a totally engaging wine."
Chardonnay,US,California,Foley,30.0,92.0,"Sea salt, honeysuckle, lemon-sprayed apple and a touch of graphite dominate the nose of this tasty wine that grows only more interesting with time. Lime zest plays on the edges of the palate, though the middle shows a nectarine and yellow-pear richness. Energetic acidity tickles the tongue throughout the sip."
Graciano,US,Washington,Idilico,30.0,92.0,"This wine captivates with its exotic aroma profile of citrus peel, mango, leather, cranberries and pepper. The acid is bright and it possesses a textured, palate-coating mouthfeel and a long finish that demands attention."
Red Blend,US,California,Terre Rouge,30.0,92.0,"An impressive mouthfeel is the standout characteristic of this full-bodied, balanced and elegant wine. It smells and tastes subtly delicious, with restrained rather than overripe cherry and plum flavors, but the way the velvety texture of tannins and acidity surround the fruit and carry it through to the finish is remarkable. The blend holds Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Domaine J. Meuret,30.0,92.0,"This mesmerizing offering has aromas of lemon curd, mineral, almond, flowers, nectarine and apple. The palate is rounded, with a lightly creamy feel while retaining a sense of vibrancy and lightness."
Rosé,France,Provence,Estandon,30.0,92.0,"Always aged for an extra year before release, this wine is produced in honor of Jean Bagnis, a pioneer in Provence rosé. It balances richness with a light touch that gives fruity, refreshing pleasure. A shake of pepper lifts the palate and leads to the final red-fruit-crisp aftertaste."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,McNab Ridge,30.0,92.0,"A gentle giant of a wine, this has huge flavors, great structure and massive fine-grained tannins but it's still poised and balanced. It smells almost beefy, rich, dark and black cherry-ish, yet with tasty nuances of smoke and caramel, tastes full and generous and feels attractively astringent. Best to drink after 2017."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Ottella,30.0,92.0,"Herbaceous aromas of hay and tomato leaf meld together with notes of stone fruit, citrus and flint. The round, medium-bodied palate offers white grapefruit, candied nectarine zest, white peach, aromatic herb and mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Grieve,30.0,92.0,This is a gorgeously floral and herbal wine nuanced in curvy minerality that both defines it and allows it to support lovely accents of apricot and peach.
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,30.0,92.0,"A truly aromatic Riesling that has a wonderful series of fruit and spice perfumes. It's ripe and full in the mouth, offering a strongly mineral edge as well as rich apple and citrus. Textured and still very tangy, the complex wine needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Merlot,US,Washington,Helix by Reininger,30.0,92.0,"A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice. This is one of the finest pure Washington Merlots to be released in many years."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Luneau-Papin,30.0,92.0,"Proof again from Pierre Luneau that Muscadet can age. This wine, 11 years old, still tastes fresh. The only concession to age is the loss of the high green primary fruits, but the flavors have then rounded out, still creamy, still full of vivacious acidity, but now with almonds, some toast and ripeness."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Salcheto,30.0,92.0,"Toast, mocha, spiced plum and pipe tobacco aromas come together in this savory red. The palate offers juicy raspberry, wild cherry, star anise and vanilla notes with firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2026."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Fenestra,30.0,92.0,"Hefty tannins are resolved into a velvety texture by the intense fruit and cedar flavors in this full-bodied, beautifully made wine. Notes like blueberry, dark chocolate and cocoa powder coat the palate and linger on the finish. It's thick and tannic in mouthfeel, but those tannins feel rounded and generous."
Syrah,US,Washington,Guardian,30.0,92.0,"The 4% Viognier shows prominently, with perfumed aromas of fresh flowers and orange peel out in front of plum, purple fruit and smoked meat. The fruit flavors are sweet and saturated, with the dial turned way up. It brings a sense of deliciousness that is impossible to ignore."
Carignan,Chile,Maule Valley,Morandé,30.0,92.0,"This blend of 78% Carignan, 18% Syrah and 4% Chardonnay deals a complete aromatic package of marzipan, fine oak and smooth berry fruits. A compact wall-to-wall palate is boldly acidic but balanced by pulpy berry fruit. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and burnt toast finish under control, with elegance and length. Drink through 2023."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Paul Blanck,30.0,92.0,"The heady scent of Damask rose rises from the glass. The peach on the rich, soft and mellow palate is bathed in rose scent too. Residual sweetness boosts the perfumed aspect of this wine, bringing lychee and peach into play as well. A lovely phenolic edge provides structure and fluidity on this textbook Gewurztraminer. The finish is off dry."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,MacLaren,30.0,92.0,"This is a quiet, subtle and deliciously crafted white, moderate in acidity, that presents as crisp and dry. Meyer lemon shines brightest, providing a refreshing complexity as stony minerality adds texture."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Wunsch & Mann,30.0,92.0,"Lifted citrus blossom and luscious peach notes rise from the glass. The palate follows this with sweetness, as though rose petals were dipped into blossom honey. The floral overtones are accentuated by a bitter caramel note, leaving a medium-sweet finish. Lovely now, the wine will still develop. Drink 2016–2022"
Loin de l'Oeil,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,30.0,92.0,"Late harvest rather than botrytized, although here the richness and the superripe fruit have something of the same effect. Honeyed with yellow fruits and dried apricots, it is a gorgeously ripe sweet wine that is balanced with the wonderful acidity. Drink this wine soon, say from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade de São Miguel,30.0,92.0,"This is a serious, concentrated wine. Still young, with dark tannins to go with the dark fruit, it was fermented in open tanks, a process that gives the wine extra richness. It has hints of the wood aging behind the ripe fruit and final acidity. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,La Fenêtre,30.0,92.0,"This blend of grapes from Bien Nacido, Presqu'ile and Riverbench vineyards is light in color with aromas of turned earth, dust and sliced strawberries. It's elegant and lean on the palate, with lots of slate and graphite minerality warming up toward macerated strawberry sauce. Pair with everything from white fish to pork tenderloin."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Ottella,30.0,92.0,"This vibrant white features delicate but enticing aromas of black locust flower, jasmine and stone fruit. The round, bright palate offers creamy peach, crisp apple and juicy nectarine alongside firm acidity. It closes on a mineral note."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Wagram-Donauland,Anton Bauer,30.0,92.0,"Ripe, red cherry, with floral notes of rose, iris and a hint of cinnamon introduce this ripe and luscious wine that is already surprisingly open and generous. Its gentle, finely-knit tannic structure will allow this to age, but there is a pleasant, seductive mellowness already in the alternating layers of spice and cherry. Drink from 2014–2018."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,30.0,92.0,"This is an elegant wine, blended with 13% Merlot and just a splash of Carmenère adding some peppery spice. Surprising citrus highlights suggest tangerine juice and rind, and the tart pomegranate and wild cherry fruit slides gracefully into sleek tannins."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Pellé,30.0,92.0,"This is a wine to age, with such concentration in its texture and mineral structure. It offers rich white fruits and touches of spice. The aftertaste with its apples, green fruits and hints of apricot, is fresh and still developing. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,30.0,92.0,"The combination of chalk and flint soils has produced a wine that is young and all about minerality at this stage. It has considerable potential with its hints of ripe fruits. For now, with texture dominant, it is still fresh, tangy and developing. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sante Arcangeli,30.0,92.0,"From nearly 30-year-old vines planted at 1,700 feet, this very balanced wine begins with an excellent nose of citrus blossoms, lime rinds, salted cream and a touch of popcorn. The sharply focused palate rides a racy line of lime zest with flashes of tangerine and lemon and a creamy character on the edge, mouthwatering throughout the sip."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,René Muré,30.0,92.0,A very vivid impression of tart red currant on the nose soon attains a creamy edge. The palate has beautiful purity of fruit: Red currant heightened by vivid citrus freshness. There is something weightless and wonderfully light about this with its really fine mousse—a sophisticated dry apéritif with a wonderful and long aftertaste of tart red apple.
Syrah,US,California,DeTierra Vineyards,30.0,92.0,"Squeezed boysenberry, smoked beef, thyme, lavender and even rosemary show on the nose of this fresh and smoky bottling from a lesser-known appellation. The savory qualities invade the palate, where dried herbs, soy and smoked meat hang on a backbone of dense berry fruit and slightly chunky tannins, finishing with crushed mint."
Pinot Blanc,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,30.0,92.0,"Light and fresh, this is a consistently delicious aromatic white from the appellation, a chiseled study in white peach, pear and lilting acidity. Floral in zesty grapefruit, it adds a streak of ginger spice to the finish, with just the right amount of rich body to add weight."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Muxagat,30.0,92.0,"This smooth and rich selection is wood aged and full of ripe, juicy black fruits. Made from grapes sourced from vineyards in the upper valley of the Douro, it showcases its tough, mineral soil while retaining its dense weight. Worth aging for at least four years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta dos Murças,30.0,92.0,"This wine, the first vintage produced by the Esporão winemaking team, gives fine, elegant Douro tannins along with new wood and rich flavors of damson and blackberry. It is structured, powerful and very age worthy. Keep for at least four years."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Mersiol,30.0,92.0,"Juicy peach and aromatic orange make for an appetizing fruit-driven opening. The palate adds an element of pure zestiness and bright freshness to these exuberant, ripe and enticing fruit notes. This masters this playful tension between fruit and freshness beautifully. There is a touch of heat on the just-about-dry finish, but this spells fun, full fruit and total refreshment. Drink 2017–2025."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann,30.0,92.0,"A rich, mellow whiff of vanilla and burnt sugar sweeps across the nose at first before appetizing tart notes of Granny Smith apple kick in. The palate is superfresh with these same green apple notes but also has a toasty mellowness adding and earthy charm and a richer, pithy texture. The finish is rounded but dry and lasting."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Dopff & Irion,30.0,92.0,"Hay flowers and juicy yellow pear create an enticing nose and promise rich ripeness. The palate brims with wonderfully ripe pear fruit, countered by citric freshness that brightens and heightens the flavors. The mouthfeel is rich but defined. It is the wonderful streak of freshness that holds all of this rich fruitiness together. The finish is dry and refreshing."
Barbera,US,California,Andis,30.0,92.0,"Gutsy and full-bodied, this small-production wine offers more structure than usual, its bright acidity and ripe tannins in full support of the tasty red and black cherry flavors. With earth, beef and oak nuances, it will taste great with hearty proteins, especially after some cellaring. Best after 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Campolargo,30.0,92.0,"This is a balanced blend of seven grapes, headed by Bairrada's own Baga. It is this grape that gives the tannins and tight acidity that dominate this structured wine. Its potential is considerable, with its texture still evolving. The black-currant fruits at the end are crisp and will soften with age. Drink from 2019."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Château d'Estoublon,30.0,92.0,"Like all wines from Les Baux, this is made from organically grown grapes. It's rich, packed with dense black fruits and tannins. With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend giving structure, this concentrated wine will repay aging. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,30.0,92.0,"Ripe Williams pear with grapefruit overtones segues into a creamy, almost buttery rounded palate that nonetheless has the tautness and verve of pure citrus zest. There are mellower tones here, too, of wet earth, pear juice and balm. This shows impressive elegance, length and personality. Drink now until 2025."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Syncline,30.0,92.0,"Brilliantly aromatic, this wine beguiles with exotic scents of plum pudding, spice cake, cherry compote, pipe tobacco, red licorice and raspberry jam. All that and more can be tasted—the wine is a riot of fruits and baking spices. This makes the best possible case for Mourvèdre as a stand-alone varietal wine here in Washington."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Full Pull & Friends,30.0,92.0,"Aromas of flowers, graphite, licorice and high-toned herbs are followed by red- and black-fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end. This has an extremely high yum factor that demands another sip."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sinor-LaVallee,30.0,92.0,"Mike Sinor puts most of his Bassi Ranch fruit, which grows just 1.3 miles from the Shell Beach seafront, into this bottling, which shows ginger snaps, iron, cinnamon, strawberry fruit and black slate on the nose. The palate is tight, focused and driven by rocky minerals, offering just enough cranberry juice to keep it delicious."
Roussanne,US,Washington,Latta,30.0,92.0,"Aromas of beeswax, honeysuckle and mineral charm the senses. The flavors are palate-coating and creamy in feel with an extended finish—extremely impressive stuff!"
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Mas des Etoiles,30.0,92.0,"The 18-month wood aging has made this both a rich wine and a structured one. Black fruits are beginning to emerge from the dense texture. It is serious, complex and worth aging. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Robert Weil,30.0,92.0,"Whispers of saffron and pollen lend mineral intensity to succulent yellow peach and cherry notes in this juicy yet revitalizing Riesling. It's semisweet in style with a dancing, lacy sugariness that lingers gently on the palate."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Brezza,30.0,92.0,"Mature dark-skinned berry, leather, forest floor, eucalyptus and dark cooking spice aromas come together in the glass. The delicious palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, white pepper, clove and licorice alongside round, chewy tannins."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Ebony,30.0,92.0,"This is the personal project of Archery Summit winemaker Chris Mazepink. It's named for the bees that buzz around the vines. Rich gold in hue, it marries the flavors of ripe apples to bee pollen and lemon curd. The flavors fold into a well-developed finish, bringing up highlights of citrus peel."
Syrah,US,California,Falcone,30.0,92.0,"A juicy and smoky nose of black cherries, vanilla, smoked pork and teriyaki is lifted aromatically by pretty violet elements on the nose of this bottling. The palate centers on a blackberry-jam character, with roasted fennel and black-licorice candy adding quality spice."
Champagne Blend,France,Champagne,Baron-Fuenté,30.0,92.0,"This Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier blend is perfectly ready to drink with fine mature fruit, layers of toast and tangy spice. From a very good Champagne vintage, it's rich while having plenty of acidity to allow it to age further."
Aglianico,US,California,Giornata,30.0,92.0,"Few are experimenting with this black grape variety, but Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi's bottlings—including this one from the Paso Highlands—suggest more should. Deep, rich and intriguing aromas of stewed plums, vanilla-bean cake and Chinese hoisin sauce give way to heady flavors of blue and purple fruit, all seasoned expertly and showing great verve."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Crasto,30.0,92.0,"This wine has fine tannins, rich black fruits and a dry core. It is produced by the Roquette family, who owns this spectacular estate high above the Douro. A solid, structured wine, it's packed with tannins and fruit, finishing with acidity. Drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Terra d'Oro,30.0,92.0,"Complex and well balanced, this is a great example of a wine made for meal time. Aromas of wood smoke, raspberry, cherry and plum lead to light savory, beefy, spicy notes in the flavors. The body is full, the texture broad and soothing, and the finish lingers warmly."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,VIgnobles René Renon,30.0,92.0,"This comes from one of the small Margaux vineyards that are dotted amongst the big-name estates. René Renon's wine is ripe and juicy—still young and exuberant. It balances Merlot and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc in almost equal proportions, giving a wine that has structure and plenty of berry fruits. Drink this wine from 2020."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Lombardy,Nera,30.0,92.0,"Forest floor, flint, Alpine herb, sandalwood, leather and pressed rose are some of the scents you'll discover on this mountain Nebbiolo. The precise, radiant palate delivers dried red cherry, raspberry, white pepper, anise and tobacco. It's well balanced with firm refined tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2018–2026."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Pamplin,30.0,92.0,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up three-quarters of this blend with the balance Merlot (22%) and Malbec. Coming from a who's who of vineyards that includes Klipsun, Canoe Ridge, Seven Hills, and Alder Ridge, it displays aromas of toasty spices, graphite, fresh herb and black currant. The dark-fruit flavors are polished to a fine sheen, showing hang time on the finish. It impresses."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,30.0,92.0,"The chalk soil of Champagne makes a reappearance in the Pfersigberg vineyard. In this wine it shows as elegance and crispness. That's not to take away from the rich, rounded texture and exotic fruits; it adds complexity and great style. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Shea,30.0,92.0,"This stylish, tightly wound, concentrated effort features yellow fruits adorned with layers of toast, butter and caramel. It will continue to open gracefully over a 48-hour window, suggesting that it may be cellared successfully. But if you have the patience to decant/aerate properly, it is immensely enjoyable right now, and a very fine value."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Gueguen,30.0,92.0,"Located on the right bank of the Serein, this vineyard produces rich warm wines. This is a ripe full wine with great white fruits that are balanced by spice and fine acidity. The texture is dense and full—a generous wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine les Pins,30.0,92.0,"This is the top wine from Pitault-Landry at Domaine les Pins. It is concentrated, ripe and firmly structured. Wood aging has smoothed the texture and brought out the red fruits. It still could age further with its generous fruitiness. Drink from late 2017."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Schubert,30.0,92.0,"The 2007 Gosling manages to combine savory, spicy complexity with bold fruit, delivering peppery, herbal notes alongside cherry and blueberry flavors. It's mouthfilling, with a creamy texture, yet retains a sense of freshness on the lingering finish. Drink now-2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Adega de Cantanhede,30.0,92.0,"The wine is a rich blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional that is ripe and juicy with solid tannins and generous black fruits. There are firm tannins that will probably always be a part of the wine along with acidity and black plum richness. The wood aging has helped to smooth the wine on the way, while still promising further development. Drink from 2017."
Champagne Blend,France,Champagne,Jacquart,30.0,92.0,"Light and elegant, this spicy, lively wine is a gentle joy. There is a precision and refinement evident here that makes other Champagnes seem almost clumsy. The delicate flavors of fresh apple, pear and citrus are further enhanced with pretty cinnamon spice."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Wairau Valley,Villa Maria,30.0,92.0,"A big and bold Sauvignon Blanc, packed with flavors of mango, nectarine and fresh herbs that come together beautifully on the nose and palate. Long on the finish. Drink now through mid-2011."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Bodegas Hidalgo,30.0,92.0,"Oily aromas of almond extract and peanut butter are earthy, a tad briny and classic in terms of offering buttery, yeasty notes of flor. This feels round, oily and deeply textured. Flavors of almond skins, sea salt and dried stone fruits finish loud and long."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Pfister,30.0,92.0,"Very vivid notes of green citrus signal refreshment and lightness. The palate confirms this near weightless lightness and underlines it with fine tiny bubbles that fizz away creamily, providing a counterpoint and resulting in a wine that is both exquisitely light, dry, creamy and elegant. If you are looking for a sophisticated but light apéritif, this is your answer."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann,30.0,92.0,"A subdued nose opens up into a citrus palate that has unusual licorice overtones, with smoky intrigue. The body is precise and bone dry, letting lemon and licorice shine and allowing the citrus freshness to brighten and heighten everything. The finish is superclean. Drink this now through 2025."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Schloss Gobelsburg,30.0,92.0,"A fresh lemon nose almost has a touch of herb or grass. The palate rounds this out with a balance of ripe lemon and stone-fruit freshness, while the light and creamy body offers beautifully fine fizz. A dry aftertaste has the tart freshness of green apples. The wine has an elegant, dry apéritif style with wonderful length."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes,30.0,92.0,"Creamy notes of strawberry shortcake make for an alluring nose. The impression continues on the palate with very fine creamy mousse while the more tender, tart red-berry notes now gain some enticing pepper spice. This is a very elegant, dry apéritif style. Without any dosage the finish is long, refreshing and dry."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Caliterra,30.0,92.0,"Deep, pure cassis and red berry aromas are integrated and thorough. This Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot is racy, tight and hard-driving, with bold berry, pepper, baking spice and chocolate flavors. A toasty, peppery finish is juicy, forward and long. Drink through 2020."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Baron De Ley,30.0,92.0,"This is a fine gran reserva from a great vintage. Aromas of vanilla, cedar, earth and spiced black fruits lead to a fresh pure palate with tomato-like snap. Cherry, cassis, tobacco and chocolate flavors finish smooth and clean, with just enough tannic grip. Drink through 2022."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sineann,30.0,92.0,"The reserve is bottled only in 375-ml bottles, and in extremely limited quantities. The extra ripeness is evident in both the alcohol content and the overall mouthfeel. For some tasters it will push this ahead of the regular Wy'east, though some detail is sacrificed along the way. Dense, almost chunky, it brings big bites of chocolate and nougat along with solid flavors of cherry cola. Drink now through 2020."
Merlot,US,Washington,Forgeron,30.0,92.0,"Merlot has long been a particular strength at Forgeron. Up front in this new release is a thick vein of chocolate around rich black cherry fruit. The wine dips a bit in midpalate, then re-emerges in a finish with chewy tannins and citrusy acidity. The odds strongly favor more improvement with further bottle age; try after 2016."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Berger,30.0,92.0,"Appetizing, full-fruited but crisp pear notes are framed by very creamy, intense yeast notes. The palate, despite its slender linearity, surprises with immense concentration and a creamy but incisive texture. A wine of extremes with incredibly full flavour."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Diora,30.0,92.0,"This is a dense and heavy take on the grape, but done with style, showing vanilla cookie, clove and deep anise spice atop the black cherry core. Gingerbread, red cinnamon and Christmas spice liven up the baked red-plum fruit of the palate, laced with rich oak flavorings. It's not a dainty wine, but it's certainly delicious."
Riesling,US,Washington,Figgins,30.0,92.0,"Sold through the wine club. Excellent concentration in this ripe, full-bodied Riesling. It delivers a boat-load of fruit flavors, explosive aromatics and marvelous length. Citrus, peach and pear fruit is underscored with delicate minerality. Juicy, sappy and long."
Syrah,US,Washington,Stevens,30.0,92.0,"This new vintage is sourced from a single block from the Dineen vineyard, and aged in 50% new French oak—the most ever. Black fruits abound, along with licorice, tar and a whiff of iodine. It's a tightly wound Syrah, with the stuffing and style to age for a decade or longer."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,La Playa,30.0,92.0,"This starts out appealing. Licorice, spice, coconut and vanilla aromas are entirely inviting. On the palate it delivers a tight deck of lemony oak, raspberry fruit, spice and vanilla. This finishes fiery and with a sinewy structure. Drink this Cabernet-led, five-grape blend through 2019; 500 cases made."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château de Jurque,30.0,92.0,"The golden richness of Petit Manseng is very evident in this dry wine. There are the hallmark hints of honey and hugely ripe citrus and grapefruit flavors. They give both power and intensely crisp fruitiness, making this just now ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Suduiraut,30.0,92.0,"The lighter of the two second wines of classed-growth Suduiraut, this is a more accessible reflection of the richness of the grand vin. At four years old, it's still young, its acidity and crisp lemon flavors contrasting its core of botrytis and delicious fruit. Drink this balanced wine from 2020."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Blanco Nieva,30.0,92.0,"This old-vines beauty from one of Rueda's top producers offers pure and inviting aromas of fresh apple, citrus and mineral. It tastes of lemon-lime and green apple, while a mineral quality carries onto the fresh and zesty finish. Drink now."
Chardonnay,US,California,Chalone Vineyard,30.0,92.0,"An attention-grabbing combination of pretty botanicals characterizes the nose of this bottling, with crisp, tonic-like aromas of lime peel and quinine mixing with fresh green pear and citrus flesh. The palate is driven by a zesty line of acidity that unveils chalk, kiwi fruit and cooked apples on the finish. It's tightly wound and fascinating."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Fox Creek,30.0,92.0,"This is a full-bodied, plushly textured wine that doesn't quite go over the top. Vanilla and dill notes accent blackberry and plum fruit before finishing firm, crisp and long. This has all the ingredients, it just needs time to come together. Drink 2020–2030."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,TerraNoble,30.0,92.0,"This is one of the best wines Terranoble has ever bottled. Wide-grained oak aromas are creamy and dominant, with lead pencil, plum and berry fruit scents resting below the surface. Oaky, lightly baked plum and boysenberry flavors finish in layers, with barrel-driven spice notes adding complexity. Drink through 2022."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Numanthia,30.0,92.0,"Since its inception, Numanthia has never once bottled a disappointing Termes. Aromas of lemon peel and orange rind mix with blackberry and cassis notes. This feels tight and tannic, but structured and appropriate. Dark-berry and chocolate flavors finish tannic but healthy. This is true-to-form Toro.Drink through 2021."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,COS,30.0,92.0,"A blend of Grecanico and Insolia and fermented with wild yeasts in concrete tanks, this unusual white offers intriguing aromas of dried Mediterranean herb, sea breeze, candied citrus zest and wild flower. The savory, mineral-driven palate offers nectarine, dried apricot, saline, sage and baking spice while a honey note wraps around the finish."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Global Wines,30.0,92.0,"Who can resist a wine called the Lovers' Vineyard? Finely aged in wood, it comes from the highest point of the Santar estate and is rich in yellow fruit and toasty spice. Creamy, smooth and lightly tangy, it needs another few months to mature. Drink from 2018."
Alsace white blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,30.0,92.0,"The flinty but utterly promising scent of reduction still hovers above this wine: clearly this is not meant to be drunk now. The palate underneath already tells of the freshest apple fruit, of depth and purity plus a woody roundness. Let this sleep in your cellar until 2017–2023."
Chardonnay,US,California,Neyers,30.0,92.0,"This is a luxuriously layered and complex white. It's an expertly rendered combination of ripe, rich fruit—most notably spicy apple and pear—that's completely uplifted by bright acidity and a refreshing mouthfeel. Still youthful, it's both vibrant and nuanced."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Love & Squalor,30.0,92.0,"This classic, bone-dry Riesling is sourced from almost 40-year-old vines. Made with native yeast, fermented in stainless tanks, and not put through secondary fermentation, it's an acid lover's wine. Aromatic and textural, it brings citrus, yellow plum and green pineapple into focus, with penetrating tartness."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Hiedler,30.0,92.0,"The nose is aromatic and zesty, with alluring grapefruit-peel spice. On the palate these flavors relax and coalesce into a juicy but concentrated whole made up of lemon and ripe Mirabelle plum—an irresistible contrast between juicy flesh and tart zest. The body of this invigorating wine is dry, brisk and slender."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,DanCin,30.0,92.0,"The winery's various Chardonnays are defined by their varying clonal mixes. Here the blend delivers polished flavors of lemon-lime, orange peel and apple butter. There's a hint of bourbon barrel also, from aging in mostly neutral French oak. This young wine is round, full bodied and spicy, ready for immediate enjoyment."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca la Celia,30.0,92.0,"This Malbec blend is ripe and woodsy, with cedary boysenberry and cassis aromas that are spicy and include some barnyard. A full, hammering palate is tanninc and grating. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and vanilla finish on both sides of the line that divides elegance from rugged intensity. Drink through 2024."
Riesling,US,California,Cutruzzola,30.0,92.0,"Notes of fresh honeysuckle, baking soda and shaved citron mix with tons of slate, gravel and wet rocks on the nose of this great bottling. There's the slightest touch of sweetness to the palate, where waves of vibrant acidity carry forth flavors of orange blossom and mandarin as well as a grapefruit peel twist. It's certainly drinkable now, but will mature and evolve well through 2034."
Grüner Veltliner,US,California,Carlisle,30.0,92.0,"There aren't a lot of producers making this variety in America, let alone a Zinfandel and Rhone-wine specialist, but it works on every level, the wine offering a concentration of rich apple, pear and stone fruit, the texture rounded and complex."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,30.0,92.0,"Chalk and flint soil contribute to this tight, tangy, amazingly crisp wine. Behind this still-young texture await ripe apples, green plums and orange peel. Packed with acidity and still developing, this wine needs some more time. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Durant,30.0,92.0,"This single clone estate-grown wine was vinified 50-50 in stainless and mainly neutral oak. It's punchy and tight, with complex apple, peach and lemon/lime fruit. A light touch of toast enlivens the back palate and finish. Good already, it's designed for ageability. Drink now through 2028."
Tannat,US,California,Heringer,30.0,92.0,"Extra ripeness and an extra-plush texture elevate this full-bodied wine to a high level of enjoyment. Aromas suggest fresh-baked bread, nutmeg and wood smoke, while flavors convey black cherry and cranberry. A sense of depth and layering adds special appeal. Best after 2020."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodega Carmen Rodríguez,30.0,92.0,"Deep, attractive aromas of blackberry, cassis, prune and toast are what Toro is known for. This is intense on the palate but in good balance, with strong but tolerable tannins. Blackberry, cassis, black cherry and toasty flavors finish with an iron grip. Drink from 2018–2028."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Lustau,30.0,92.0,"Dusty toffee and dried stone-fruit aromas are pure and inviting. This is ultra crisp and fresh, with ripping acidity. Flavors of toffee, salted peanuts and sharp-leaning dry white fruits finish racy and with precision. This is a classic complex amontillado purchased from the cellar of Manuel Cuevas Jurado."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sinor-LaVallee,30.0,92.0,"Mike Sinor ekes out every last ounce of richness from his extreme coastal vineyard for this bottling, which shows mulberry and dark plum aromas along with loamy soil and dried rose petal. The flavors are equally hearty, evoking mulberry and black plum, but underlying black pepper, olive and herbal notes keep that ripeness in check. Its tannins are dense and the finish minty."
Meritage,US,California,Edna Valley Vineyard,30.0,92.0,"This is a great way to experience big Paso power and lushness in a relatively affordable way. The wine's nose kicks off with rich and delicious blackberry pie and hot vanilla-crust aromas, enhanced by black-cherry pastry, baking spice and dill. Cassis and kirsch notes show on the palate, as does milk chocolate and caramelized fruit."
Welschriesling,Austria,Burgenland,Rosenhof,30.0,92.0,"Ripe yellow plum and plump, red-cheeked apricot lead a merry dance. Light, clear honey fills any gaps while notions of passion fruit and lemony acid temper the richness. A very, very fresh-fruited TBA with immense liveliness."
Syrah,Chile,San Antonio,Lapostolle,30.0,92.0,"Earthy, tarry, gritty aromas come with generous black-fruit scents. This is bold, bright and lively in character, with juicy acidity creating a racy pulse. Spice, licorice, plum and tomato flavors finish fresh and elegant, with clarity and length. Drink through 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Fall Line,30.0,92.0,"This blend of 45% Cabernet Franc, 44% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon impresses with its accents of dried herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate. It's palate-coating in feel, with a dazzling sense of texture backed by fine-grained tannins."
Uva di Troia,Italy,Southern Italy,Alberto Longo,30.0,92.0,"The intriguing nose highlights smoke, charred earth, black spice, blackberry and grilled herb. These carry over to the structured but elegant palate along with black cherry and an intense licorice note. Firm but polished tannins give support and generate a smooth texture. It's already delicious but will gain complexity. Drink 2016–2022."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Rosenhof,30.0,92.0,"The musky scent of botrytis bathes everything in its gold-tinged flavor: there are hints of maple syrup, bitter honeycomb and candied orange peel. The mouthfeel is viscous and rich, the flavours almost decadent but balanced by deliciously bitter and tart notes of citrus zest."
Rosé,US,California,Clos du Val,30.0,92.0,"Dark pinkish-red, this wine comes from two blocks of the producer's Carneros estate, which are harvested at lower sugar ripeness to offer a dry refreshing experience, which this wine does. This exudes weighty and broad flavors of tangy watermelon, orange and cranberry, with a satisfying grip of power on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Domaine Eden,30.0,92.0,"Grapefruit rind, yogurt, sour cream and warm pear show on the nose of this bottling. There is great acidity on the sip, with a mango cream and tropical fruit touch, but those elements coalesce into a rich, roasted-almond-driven palate as the wine breathes."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud,30.0,92.0,"This east-facing vineyard is in the village of Fuissé. With the wood-aging giving spice and toast flavors, it is a ripe wine. The wood marches well with the apple and green-plum fruits. Still young, this rich wine has a mineral texture that comes from chalky soil. Drink from 2019."
Merlot,US,Washington,Guardian,30.0,92.0,"This pure Merlot coats the mouth with opulent berry and cherry fruit and silky tannins. Crafted from Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee and Stonetree vineyard grapes, the poise, balance, integration and persistence are outstanding, as is the value."
Syrah,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,30.0,92.0,"Numerous sites in the Horse Heaven Hills didn't produce fruit in 2011 due a late 2010 freeze. This wine bears witness to the glory of the vines that survived unscathed with its notes of huckleberry, dark coffee and smoked meat. The flavors are silky soft and glide along to a lingering, chocolate-filled finish."
White Blend,US,California,Carlisle,30.0,92.0,"Pretty and floral, this is a field blend of Gewürztraminer, Trousseau Gris, Riesling and other mixed whites, all farmed by organic guru Phil Coturri. Full-figured and lithe, it lingers in fruit sweetness, the right call as an apéritif with spicy nuts, but especially with chips and guacamole or any other piquant fare."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Petit Métris,30.0,92.0,"A ripe, still very young wine that has a rich, almost honeyed character while remaining bone dry and tightly textured. There is a mineral character to this wine that should disappear as it ages leaving the ripe pear and apple flavors and the elusive touch of honey. Drink from 2020."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Cascina delle Rose,30.0,92.0,"This elegant Nebbiolo has an alluring fragrance of rose petal and ripe berry while the palate delivers succulent strawberry, mint and mineral notes. Silky smooth and very fresh, drink this young to catch the softer side of Nebbiolo in all its glory."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Lange,30.0,92.0,"This is a luscious, butterscotchy, fresh, lime- and lemon-flavored Chardonnay; a true delight. Melon and peach fruit flavors thread into the core, and the wine has a wonderful richness without losing its finesse or acid base."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Viñas del Cenit,30.0,92.0,"Lower in price than Cenit's Old Vines, but to me this is a better, more open wine with bacon, spice and bold black-fruit aromas. The palate is full but retains finesse as well as big tannins; flavors of black fruits come with chocolate, coffee and spice. Full-force stuff but still fairly refined. Drink now through 2014."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Bossi,30.0,92.0,"Aromas of chopped mint, underbrush, spiced berry, toast and a whiff of iris take shape on this savory, approachable wine. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the ripe round palate offers dried cherry, raspberry, truffle and licorice framed in supple tannins. It finishes on a savory, almost salty note. Drink through 2020."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Pujanza,30.0,92.0,"Dry, earthy plum and berry aromas are attractive and unadulterated. This feels alert, with a refined texture and full tannins supporting red plum and raspberry fruit. A structured, mildly tannic finish tastes peppery and a bit woody, all good signs for the future. Drink through 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Baker Lane,30.0,92.0,"Earthy and spicy, this is classic cool-climate, coastal Pinot, with a whole-cluster mentality and depth of complex flavor and texture. Tart pomegranate and cranberry combine for a light-hearted approach to the vintage, with herbal accents that reach far across the soulful finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Westerly,30.0,92.0,"The nose on this wine, which is now being made by former Harlan Estate cellar master Adam Henkel, is fresh and boisterous with lime sorbet and lemon glacé aromas. The palate is clean and crisp yet quite tropical, with sweetgrass, mango and papaya flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Kelleher,30.0,92.0,"This is a sophisticated, stylish and ultimately tasty wine, given time in mostly stainless steel, with 10% in neutral oak. Fleshy, floral and full bodied without ever becoming obtrusive, it offers a nice mix of Meyer lemon and vanilla. The elements are integrated and the punchy texture offers both depth and breadth."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weszeli,30.0,92.0,"Baked apple and freshly cut apple peel make for an appealing introduction. Honey and lemon notes join in on the palate and give all of that apple fruit a zesty but textured lift. Very fresh, but very satisfying with appealing, lasting length."
Zinfandel,US,California,Klinker Brick,30.0,92.0,"Just plain delicious, this full-bodied wine starts with ripe blueberry and dark chocolate aromas. Next, generous, ripe, saturated fruit flavors flood the mouth, seeming to deepen with each sip. The mouthfeel stays smooth but is enhanced by moderate tannins and ample acidity for good balance."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,30.0,92.0,"Scented and fresh, this presents wiry, full-fruited flavors of red and green apple with a good dollop of zesty, pervasive freshness. There is quite a bit of concentration on a very streamlined body with lots of drive and a very vivid, lip-smacking finish."
Syrah,US,California,Amador Cellars,30.0,92.0,"This big but complex wine offers wonderful varietal characteristics. Sage and blackberry highlight the aromas, while equally interesting black pepper, beef and blackberry flavors expand on the palate. It has very good depth and a distinctive flavor profile, too."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Malibu Rocky Oaks,30.0,92.0,"One of the more promising wines coming out of the newer Malibu area, this Cab that is boosted by 10% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows deep blueberry, black currant and black olive on the nose, along with dill, pepper, spearmint and caramel-laced fudge. The intriguing palate offers black olive, black pepper and dark, deep fruit. It's well structured and tasty, like a salt- and pepper-crusted steak."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Collovray et Terrier,30.0,92.0,"Balanced, a wine that shows the right richness, spice, great wafts of fresh plums, peaches, lifted by acidity and rounded by a fine wood element."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Forgeron,30.0,92.0,"A candidate for the best Zinfandel in Washington, this firm, claret-like offering is loaded with sweet berries and spicy, pine needle penetration. Supple and smoky, it threads a dark streak of iron ore into the polished tannins. Very fine winemaking."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Helix by Reininger,30.0,92.0,"Yummy is the first word that comes to mind, followed by sounds of lip smacking. It's a rich bundle of extracted cherry and raspberry fruit, driven deep with juicy acidity, and bound with ripe tannins. The penetration and vivid tartness are remarkable, and supremely satisfying."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Loimer,30.0,92.0,"Notes of mellow, ripe apple create an appetizing nose. Those rich but fresh apple notes continue throughout the palate, giving fullness of fruit and tart freshness at the same time. Fine, creamy mousse fizzes away, dispersing delicious apple notes across the palate. The body is light and the finish gloriously fresh and dry."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey,30.0,92.0,"The golden ripeness of yellow stone fruit is already apparent on the nose. On the palate a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge provides some structure to counter the luscious medium-sweet richness. That sweetness boosts all the fruit notes and lets them linger. It's a rounded, balanced and totally fruit-driven wine."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Ottella,30.0,92.0,"Yellow peach, pear, mineral, Alpine herbs and almond jump out of the glass. The elegant but structured palate delivers a great depth of flavors alongside crisp acidity. It's already delicious but will also develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink now through 2016."
Red Blend,Austria,Thermenregion,Gebeshuber,30.0,92.0,"White pepper mixed with clove and cinnamon frames the cherry fruit on this elegant, almost understated red. That delicious white pepper edge highlights and spices every impression of this nuanced, moreish red."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Vignobles Berthier,30.0,92.0,"This is one of a range of three wines from different soils. Silex soil is flinty, giving, as here, ageworthy, structured wines. It is dense, powerful and with a range of steely textures that dominate the very crisp, taut and nervy fruits. Drink this from 2017."
Red Blend,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,30.0,92.0,Broodingly black cherry with aromatic sprays of pepper accompany notions of dark flower petals with a tarry edge. On the palate a meatiness adds a further layer of flavor. There is alcoholic strength and lots of concentration but this is a young wine which still has to come into its own. Enjoy its ripe elegance as of 2016.
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Galerie,30.0,92.0,"This gentle, complex white offers lovingly crafted waves of tropical lychee and golden-apple minerality, with bites of wet stone, gravel and lemon. Balanced in acidity and a lightness of being, it's meant for the table or kitchen, to sip happily while making a meal."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Siran,30.0,92.0,Siran is in the south of the Margaux appellation just where the gravel outcrops rise above the river. It shows its fine position in this tannic wine. It has all the black-currant fruit buried for the moment under the structure. It is a serious wine that will repay aging. Drink from 2022.
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Fielding Hills,30.0,92.0,"This blend is 82% Cabernet Franc, 6% Syrah, 6% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon. The emphasis on the Franc puts more herbal flavors in the center, with coffee grounds, black pepper and baking chocolate wrapped around the spicy and tart berry fruit. The match of acid and barrel flavored tannins is picture perfect."
Syrah,US,Washington,W.T. Vintners,30.0,92.0,"All coming from Block 1, this wine was fermented 65% whole cluster and aged for 20 months in neutral barrels. Pretty aromas of spice, flower, herb, cherry and earth give way to a full fruit-forward palate that shows a dazzling sense of purity and richness while also maintaining its restraint. It's a bit of a stylistic departure for the winery in terms of its richness but it still delivers big time."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Cascina delle Rose,30.0,92.0,"Aged in steel, this vibrant wine shows Nebbiolo's more elegant and youthful side. It weaves together rose, violet, perfumed berries, bright cherry, crushed raspberry and sweet baking spices alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy it soon to capture the crunchy berry flavors."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Famaey,30.0,92.0,"The top cuvée from Château Famaey is a rich, new-wood-aged wine. With spice, mint and toast flavors, it's opulent, ripe and full of black fruits. Even at five years, it's still young, with tannins that are dense and concentrated. Drink from 2016."
Mourvèdre,Chile,Apalta,Lapostolle,30.0,92.0,"Complete and satisfying, this Mourvèdre delivers punchy, alluring aromas of leather, rubber and dark berry fruits. This is deep and pure in the mouth, with excellent balance. Flavors of raspberry, spiced plum, currant and herbs finish long and elegant. Drink through 2018."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Le Chiuse,30.0,92.0,"Fragrant, fresh and floral, this textbook Rosso di Montalcino offers lovely aromas of wild berries, violets, pressed powder and cake spices. The delicious palate doles out juicy red cherry and crushed raspberry accented with notes of cinnamon, all wrapped up in an elegant, silky-smooth texture. Enjoy over the next few years."
Chardonnay,US,California,Stephen Ross,30.0,92.0,"The veteran San Luis Obispo-based winemaker heads south to the historic vineyard to produce this wine. A wildly dynamic nose suggests unripe lemon skin, pencil lead, oak and smoky wisps of a beach campfire. The woody, cedar element—though not really oaky—provides an intriguing palate of pencil shavings, green pear skins and lime pith."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Casa al Vento,30.0,92.0,"This pure expression of Sangiovese offers classic varietal aromas of red berry, plum, violet and a whiff of dark cooking spice. The vibrant palate offers juicy black cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper, anise and a hint of tobacco. Bright acidity and polished tannins provide the framework. Enjoy 2016–2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Morell-Lawrence,30.0,92.0,"Coming from Lawrence Vineyards, this wine offers aromas of orange peel, smoke, olive, blueberry, blackberry and wood spice. The blue-fruit flavors are full bodied and perfumed, showing a pleasing sense of balance and a lingering finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Bouchaine,30.0,92.0,"This is an amazingly fresh and fruity tank-fermented wine, imparting a subtle hint of grass before unleashing sublime layers of melon and apricot alongside measured, zesty acidity. New winemaker Chris Kajani is taking things in a refreshing, aim-for-the-top direction with this bottling."
Chardonnay,US,California,Darcie Kent Vineyards,30.0,92.0,"This wine is in the tasty, full-bodied California tradition, showing lively aromas of toasted oak and butter, then ripe fruit flavors and a mouth-filling texture. It also has depth, bringing more nuances to the front with each sip, and lingering long on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,30.0,92.0,"Notes of pineapple and verbena tisane hint at some maturity. While the nose suggests richness, the palate reveals a concentrated lightness that is nonetheless dense with aroma: said pineapples as well as notes of hayflowers and dried moss and dried citrus peel. The long finish celebrates this multilayered scope beautifully."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Flechas de los Andes,30.0,92.0,"Right away this blend is clicking. Aromas of blackberry and cassis are clean and well presented. A full, free-flowing palate is in balance and showing only modest tannic grab. Blackberry, toast and chocolate flavors finish bold and a little choppy. Drink through 2020."
Garnacha,Spain,Northern Spain,Castillo de Maluenda,30.0,92.0,"Initially this smells chunky, gaseous and heavy, but with airing things turn toward minerality and red-berry scents. The palate is immediately pleasing and deep, with good structure and strong but tame tannins. Meaty red-and-black flavors are dense and delicious, while the finish is broad shouldered, with a stout feel and moderate complexity. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,Spain,Central Spain,Marques de Griñon,30.0,92.0,"Compact and harmonious up front, this three-grape blend delivers aromas of oak, dark berry fruits and prune. The palate is saturated and fully ripe, with wide tannins that don't grate. Jammy berry, raisin, coconut, tobacco and creamy oak flavors finish long and ripe. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Occhipinti,30.0,92.0,"Very pretty aromas of rose, violet and perfumed berry lead the nose on this concentrated wine. The juicy palate offers blackberry, black cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside lithe, polished tannins and bright acidity. The succulent finish closes on a mineral note."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Judean Hills,Tzuba,30.0,92.0,"Deep brick-red in color, this wine leads with aromas of stewed black fruits, petrol and green pepper. Flavors of cherry preserves, smoked meat, vanilla and a pop of tart cherry make their way across the palate, encased in silky tannins. The finish is simultaneously cool and bright."
Zinfandel,US,California,Cline,30.0,92.0,"This big but well-behaved wine brings out the pure deliciousness of the grapes. It smells perfectly ripe without being sweet or jammy, feels very elegant and rich, and tastes like blackberry-boysenberry juice. It's just tannic enough for balance, and the polished fruitiness continues through the finish."
Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,South Africa,Western Cape,Bizoe,30.0,92.0,"This beautiful Semillon-dominant blend that shows great finesse, depth and power. Rich and opulent in every way, notes of baked red apple, lemon verbena, honey-drizzled peach and sweet orange oil flood the nose and mouth, while additional flavors of hazelnut cream, fig bread and soft sweet spice carry into the long finish. Round, but with enough acidic lift to keep it from being flabby. Drink now–2015."

Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,30.0,92.0,"Faint notes of ripe pear rise from the glass. The palate comes in with fresh zestiness—it is dry and slender but has lip-smacking citrus freshness of grapefruit and tangerine. This is bundled, full of invigorating appetizing freshness. There is something bracingly clean but also harmonious about the finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Stony Hill,30.0,92.0,"Waxy and exotic with lychee scents, this is a bone-dry, nutty and meaty version of the variety, which has been grown by this producer since the 1950s. It's refreshing and complex—a perfect companion for the table or picnic basket."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Scott Family,30.0,92.0,"At first, this is plump on the nose, with cherries and warm star anise. Aromas of dried plum skins, orange rind and bitter black tea then reveal layers of complexity. Light in body and energetic on the palate, it shows strong peppery spice against the tart red fruit, making for a very lively experience."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Tooth and Nail,30.0,92.0,"This Petite Sirah, enhanced by 8% Syrah and 1% Viognier, is extremely dense on the nose, with aromas of blueberry, black currant, vanilla, tarragon and fudge.

Riesling,France,Alsace,Biecher & Schaal,30.0,92.0,"There is a whiff of flint before the tangy nose reveals itself with orange and lemon zest. This has a sprightly, lively feel and a textured, dry palate where orange zest, lemon juice and tangerine freshness play against a fruit-drenched backdrop of chalky stone. This is chock-full of fruit and joy but also really fresh. Drink 2016–2025."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Biecher & Schaal,30.0,92.0,"While the nose gives little away, the palate has a shy but very seductive nature: floral borders of honeysuckle adorn the edges of tart, fresh apple fruit and are highlighted by lemony acidity. The body is light and dry and shows playfulness and charm against a more serious, stony background. A very charming, subtle wine."
Malbec,US,California,Martin Ray,30.0,92.0,"Aromas of fresh-baked bread greet the nose on entry into this wine, an unusual find in the appellation that's blended with small percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Toast topped in plum jam accompanies a strong presence of blackberry, leather and tobacco, dusted in cinnamon. Drink now through 2023."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Duriense,Quinta da Romaneira,30.0,92.0,"Floral fruit gives this powerful wine a great lift, bringing out the tannins, the black fruits and acidity.

Riesling,France,Alsace,Boeckel,30.0,92.0,"Yellow plum, sweet apple and juicy pear form an appetizing, aromatic trinity. Those apple flavors, some of them fresh, some bruised, some baked, become the central theme of the lemon-focused palate. With some time, honeyed notes come to the fore and suggest that many things still lie hidden in this fruit-laden Riesling. The finish is dry, the entire wine is focused and still taut. It's delicious now but will reward cellaring.Drink 2015–2025."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Ebner-Ebenauer,30.0,92.0,"Notes of green apple cores; rich, savory yeast and peppery, pungent herbs characterize nose and palate. There is verve here and tons of flavor, the crispness of the vintage is beautifully countered by rounded yeastiness—but that backbone of structure and acidity shines and guarantees a long life for this wine—even though it will be difficult not to drink it now."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sarah's Vineyard,30.0,92.0,"There's a yogurt-driven dairy element on the nose of this estate wine from western Gilroy, with sleek white peach, light white pepper, lemon blossom and lime-pith aromas in support. The Brie cheese-rind tension carries to the palate, along with grapefruit pith, lime zest and bountiful energy. This bottling is great now but will hold until at least 2022."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Fontes da Cunha,30.0,92.0,"Celebrating the Roman name, Munda, for the Mondego River, this wood-aged wine is also a celebration of the great white grape of the Dão, Encruzado. It is rich, smooth and ripe, with a fine mix of tropical, yellow and crisp citrus fruits all finely integrated into the mineral texture. The wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,30.0,92.0,"Alluring blossom, lemon zest and petrol notes entice on this late-harvest Riesling. It's densely concentrated in sweet-tart pink grapefruit flavor, yet minerally and spry. Finishes with a lingering lacy sweetness."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Torre a Cona,30.0,92.0,"Aromas of underbrush, blue flowers, dark berries and a whiff of menthol unfold in the glass. The supple palate offers fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, mint and white pepper alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2021."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Passing Clouds,30.0,92.0,"Like the 2003, this is a big, no-holds-barred Shiraz. The 2005 is packed with cassis and blueberry fruit, framed by chocolate and vanilla notes and finishes with plenty of spicy complexity and some slightly rough tannins. Drink 2010–2020."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Penner-Ash,30.0,92.0,"Always a strength in the winery's white wine lineup, this is sourced from both Columbia Valley and Rogue Valley vineyards. It's aged entirely in stainless steel and walks a tight rope between citrus zest and honeysuckle, botanical herb and leafy green flavors. It's all in perfect proportion, and absolutely delicious lightly chilled."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Pertinace,30.0,92.0,"This opens with textbook Nebbiolo aromas of new leather, forest floor, red berry, culinary spice and a whiff of blue flower. On the savory palate, taut, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity support Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, star anise and white pepper flavors that should integrate after a few more years in bottle. Drink after 2022."
Red Blend,US,California,Le Casque,30.0,92.0,"An exciting discovery from Placer County, this blend of 66% Syrah and 34% Petite Sirah has a deep color, opulent blackberry and black cherry aromas and equally ripe fruit flavors that pack a lot of concentration. It's full-bodied, firmly tannic and so rich the fruit seems to cling to the sides of the mouth."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Ribafreixo,30.0,92.0,"With 80% Alicante Bouschet, the wine is concentrated and firm. Its powerful tannins and dense texture along with the solid plum and juicy black-fruit flavors make for a rich and intense wine. It is going to need time. Drink from 2019."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Donkey & Goat,30.0,92.0,"With a dusty, cola-like quality, this flirty Mourvèdre gets better and better over time in the glass, unveiling layers of floral, earthy and wild raspberry notes sprinkled with a suggestion of gamy meat. With firm, chewy tannins and a mouth-coating texture, it showcases El Dorado's decomposed granite soils and the prowess of the winemaker with these grapes."
Red Blend,Spain,Central Spain,Marques de Griñon,30.0,92.0,"Dense ripe black-fruit aromas are moderately spicy. In the mouth, this blend of Syrah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is stout and rugged, much like Griñon's other 2011s. Flavors of ripe blackberry and cassis finish with chewy tannins and an overriding sense of ripeness. Drink through 2023."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Dopff & Irion,30.0,92.0,"The lift of heady aroma precedes the pear-fruited and herbal tisane-scented nose. The palate is gentle and has that same herbal softness. The fruit is rich with residual sweetness and characterized as ripe pear. This is balanced by zesty, pleasantly bitter citrus. The effect is of harmonious, gentle and generous balance. This mature Pinot Gris is now perfectly à point. Its flavors linger long and pleasantly."
Red Blend,US,California,Rubino Estates Winery,30.0,92.0,"This is a very concentrated, firm and tannic wine but also so ripe and almost sweet in flavor that it achieves good balance. Lush ripe berries and black cherries coat the palate, while a velvety texture adds great structure for an appetizing and gripping mouthfeel. Barbera, Petit Verdot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah grapes form the blend."
Pinot Noir,Canada,British Columbia,Kettle Valley,30.0,92.0,"Kettle Valley Winery, on the Naramata Bench, is a rising star. This gorgeous, seductive and silky wine is the perfect expression of Pinot Noir. This is what good Burgundy tastes like, with length, purity and a discreet voluptuousness."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Johannisberger,30.0,92.0,"Vibrant white grapefruit and crisp-tart peach and pear notes penetrate throughout this subtly off-dry Riesling. While light on its feet and irresistibly refreshing, it reverberates with a long, cool steeliness on the finish. Drink now through 2021."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,30.0,92.0,"Made from old vines growing in the cooler northern mountains of the Alentejo, this wine is structured and rich both with black plum fruits and from long wood aging. It is a stylish wine that bears its high alcohol well. The freshness of the wine is right there giving everything a lift at the end. Drink this still-young wine from 2018."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Peique,30.0,92.0,"Moderately complex but thoroughly inviting aromas of cherry, plum and oak lead to a pure, balanced palate with drying tannins. Flavors of cherry, kirsch, pepper and fresh herbs conclude on a still-kicking finish that's tight and elegant. Drink through 2020."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Josef Schmid,30.0,92.0,"Lifted and ultra-clean Conference pear signals a disciplined wine. The linear palate is equally pure, with zesty and fresh acidity against a background of these green pears and a mossy savoriness."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bravium,30.0,92.0,"This is an engaging, nervy wine, with a light, savory aroma and tangy red-cherry flavors riding on a firm frame of fine-grained tannins and good acidity. It does not try to overwhelm with superripe fruit or oak, but just lets the purity of the grapes shine through."
Meritage,US,Washington,Kaella,30.0,92.0,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine's fruit is sourced entirely from the Conner Lee Vineyard. The superjuicy black-cherry flavor is balanced by generous acidity. Vibrant and full, long and fresh, this could age gracefully for a decade or more."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Robert Oatley,30.0,92.0,"White peach and toasted grain aromas ease gently into a plump, custardy mouthful of melon and stone fruit. Balanced nuttiness frames the wine, giving it just enough structure on the elegant, plush finish. Drink now–2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kenwood,30.0,92.0,"The first vintage of this wine from this site, it offers a lot to like, from crisp, pretty aromas and tingly acidity to nuanced whispers of honeycomb, Gravenstein apple and fennel. Light bodied, it has nice firmness and tension to the mouthfeel, and an overall balance of fruit and complexity."
Grenache,Australia,South Australia,Thistledown,30.0,92.0,"This international venture based out of the former Nepenthe winery in the Adelaide Hills sources fruit from a number of vineyards in South Australia. This bottling is light on its feet for its 15% stated abv, showcasing fresh cherry fruit, gentle herbal notes and silky tannins. Drink now–2022."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Fouassier,30.0,92.0,"Vines up to 40-years-old are growing on this 13-acre parcel. The wine is lighter than some in this producer's range. At the same time, it is also more mineral and more textured, giving a tight steely wine that will need some time. So drink this wine from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lapa,30.0,92.0,"Created to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of Saint Theresa of Avila, this wine made from a special selection of fruit. Richly structured, it displays great style as well as intensity. Black fruits are beautifully integrated into the ripe body of the wine, backed by acidity and with tannins and wood-aging flavors in the background. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Central Otago,Loveblock,30.0,92.0,"This is intense and muscular without being overdone. Herbal and peppery notes bring nuance to the concentrated flavors of dark plum, mocha and baking spice. The finish is richly tannic but not hard, making it approachable now but capable of aging through 2030."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Raventós I Blanc,30.0,92.0,"This tan-colored bubbly from stony soils smells complex, bready, yeasty and a lot like baked apple. A round, yeasty palate is cushioned like fine bedding, while yeasty flavors of bread and apple finish long. Drink through 2020."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château la Coustarelle,30.0,92.0,"Well balanced, bringing together its firm, youthful tannins with ripe jammy fruits and  great swathes of spice and chocolate. It needs aging, but it is an impressive wine."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Jean-Luc Baldès,30.0,92.0,"From the second terrace level above the river Lot, this is a powerful as well as elegant single vineyard wine. It's touched by bitter fruits, along with great acidity and a depth of tannins."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Maison Bleue,30.0,92.0,"The inaugural vintage of this Marsanne, Grenache Blanc and Roussanne blend is impressive, with potent aromas of grapefruit and flavors of rind and pith. It's crisply defined, with excellent density and natural acidity. Still quite young, it's a wine to tuck away in the cellar until 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,30.0,92.0,"Complex and precise, this lovely Cabernet—blended with 10% Merlot and 3% Malbec—layers cassis, herb, bark, earth and graphite elements within a cigar box coating. Those streaks of tobacco are wedded to a touch of espresso as it weaves through a lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,30.0,92.0,"Grown in a chalk and flint soil, this is a strongly textured, tight wine. It has a dense mineral character, steely and with layers of citrus. Very dry, very young, this impressive wine needs to age until 2015 before drinking."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Vincent Delaporte,30.0,92.0,"A brilliant wine, shining with bright fruits, fresh and crisp. The fact that it also has weight gives it an extra intensity of herbaceous flavors, lifted by green peas. There is a definite steely edge to the finish."
Malbec,US,California,Edna Valley Vineyard,30.0,92.0,"The nose on this savory, crowd-pleasing wine is great, with attractive notes of black plum, sesame oil, soy, hoisin and salted caramel. An array of well-integrated flavors flood the palate, like black cherry stewed in Indian spice, Asian plum sauce, blackberry preserves and stewed peppercorns."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,McGregor,30.0,92.0,"A line up of McGregor's 2010 and 2011 Pinot Noirs make a bold statement for Finger Lakes Pinot, but the regular label 2011 is drinking particularly well now. Lifted violet and berry notes are intoxicating on this spicy, deftly balanced wine. Rich, ripe black-cherry and raspberry flavors blend into a liquid silk on the palate, but are framed squarely by fine-grained tannins and a spray of cranberry acidity. The finish goes on and on. Likely to drink beautifully from now through at least 2020."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Chehalem,29.0,92.0,"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth."
Red Blend,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,Lagar de Bezana,29.0,92.0,"Aromas of lead pencil, cassis, violet petal and smoky chocolate are complex and attractive. The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee. The finish is spicy, with a licorice note, and the wine's tannic composition suggests that aging is appropriate. Drink from 2014–2020."
Syrah,US,California,Mesa Del Sol,29.0,92.0,"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Dürnberg,29.0,92.0,"The chalk soil of the Rabenstein Vineyard has 50-year-old vines, which produce a dense, concentrated wine. Spice and mineral characters combine with creamed apple in a rich display. The wine could certainly age over the next 3–4 years. Screwcap."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,29.0,92.0,"Dense and intense, with loads of fine-grained tannin, this is a deep, dark-colored wine with oodles of flavor and a very thick texture. As massive as it is in texture though, delicious flavors like blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate come through and then linger on the finish. Drink from 2016 to 2026."
Chardonnay,US,California,Metz Road,29.0,92.0,"Extremely intriguing on the nose, this shows aromas of Meyer lemon, green banana and tangerines. Generous yellow fruits like melon and Gala apples show on the palate, which is soft with lemon-bar elements at first but then tightens around green apple skins and a peppery, herbal character."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,29.0,92.0,"Very ripe, almost candied notions of orange and mandarin peel determine the aromatic direction of this streamlined yet ripe Riesling. The flavors play along the entire ripe citrus spectrum: clementine and tangerine are there as well as pink grapefruit. The purity and subtlety, with hints of fragrant citrus leaves, make for a lasting impression and long finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Caves Aliança,29.0,92.0,"Earthy aromas are a hallmark of the Baga grape, a component of this full-bodied, tannic blend. With weight and richness, a mint note and new wood flavors, it is a serious wine that still should develop over three years."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Jean Foillard,29.0,92.0,"Puy means a hill, and the steep slopes of the Côte du Puy offer great exposure for the vines. The result is a densely structured, very muscular wine that shows richness as well as dark tannins. The aftertaste is sweet, streaked with acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Dutruch Grand Poujeaux,29.0,92.0,"This is turning into an impressive wine as it finds its way between solid tannins and ripe, full black fruits. It is dark and dense at this stage with tannins that dominate. A more juicy character will develop as the wine ages. Drink from 2017."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Sol Rouge,29.0,92.0,"Talk about an assertive flavor profile, this smells vividly like black pepper and black cherries, then adds smoky accents on the palate. Firm-textured and medium-bodied, it is made from one of the Rhône Valley's wildest-tasting grapes and is unconventional, unadulterated and unusually satisfying."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),29.0,92.0,"This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Carnuntum,Muhr-Van der Niepoort,29.0,92.0,"This is as tightly closed as a new rosebud, but suspicions of iron oxide and red cherry escape. On the palate this has a northerly, cool aspect and its very own, reticent charm. More iron oxide comes to the fore, along with earthiness and a mix of elderberry and red cherry. If you have the patience to wait until 2017–2018, this will come to you as a grown-up beauty. Its name Samt & Seide—velvet & silk—does it justice indeed."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Fouassier,29.0,92.0,"This ripe wine offers flavors of Williams pear and honey as well as citrus and herbal characteristics. It is full while cut with orange zest and spiciness. The wine is refreshing, sophisticated and likely to age well. Drink now and until 2020."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alta Vista,29.0,92.0,"Composed, mossy aromas of fern, black fruits and cedar are more subtle than the palate, which is intense and a bit grating. Dark flavors of chocolate, wild berry and mocha finish with depth, integrated tannins and chocolaty richness. Drink this blend of three vineyards through 2021."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Clos Haut-Peyraguey,29.0,92.0,"Rich and dense, this generous wine has considerable botrytis as well as perfumed apricot and bitter orange flavors. It's ripe and full of fruit and honey. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Aberrant Cellars,29.0,92.0,"Comprised of multiple clones from five different vineyards, this exceptional value includes a rich cohesive core of purple fruits, amplified with barrel flavors of toasted coconut and bright spice. Everything is beautifully focused across the full palate, and even after being open for a full 24 hours, the wine tastes fresh and delicious."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,29.0,92.0,"In this opulent, layered and full-bodied wine, a smoky beefy aroma and a melt-in-the-mouth texture come with flavors of dark maraschino cherries, dark chocolate and baking spices. It's very mouth filling and mouth coating as well as firmly tannic, but the richness of the flavors helps it to drink very smoothly."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Cà Lojera,29.0,92.0,"This structured white displays enticing aromas of beeswax, Spanish broom, acacia and chamomile. The round, structured palate offers mature apricot, juicy nectarine peel, yellow peach and Bartlett pear, with firm acidity. Savory herb and energizing mineral sensations signal the close."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Fonréaud,29.0,92.0,"This is a rich stylish wine from the Chanfreau family. It has fine tannins and signs of wood aging, both of which will meld into the juicy black-currant fruits. It has a predominance of Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its structure and aging potential. The aftertaste is ripe and still crisp, still young. Drink from 2020."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,The Old Faithful,29.0,92.0,"A relative bargain amid top-quality McLaren Vale Shiraz, the 2005 Top of the Hill Shiraz is beginning to show some softening and signs of maturity, yet remains intensely perfumed and flavored. Coffee bean and black olive notes start it off, backed by enough fruit richness to give it an expansive mouthfeel and long finish. Drink now–2015."
Syrah,US,Washington,Olsen Estates,29.0,92.0,"A strong effort from Olsen Estates, this 100% Syrah has fine varietal character, in a rough and tumble style. Cured meats, herbs, earth and hints of sea salt mingle with the wild berry fruit flavors. It's balanced and fresh, with lingering and nuanced flavors threading through the gulpable finish."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Sierra Cantabria,29.0,92.0,"Full and smoky at first, however as it settles the bouquet delivers ripe strawberry and additional red, jammy aromas. The palate has a healthy, very nice feel and diligent flavors of red berry fruit touched up by proper oak. Finishes creamy, with vanilla and spice flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Fleur Peyrabon,29.0,92.0,"A small part of Château Peyrabon (Haut-Médoc) is in the Pauillac appellation and is vinified and bottled separately. The wine delivers great fruit and equal richness. It is spice, packed with black plum and berry flavors. It is a powerful dense wine to age for several years. Drink from 2023."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Dürnberg,29.0,92.0,"This wine benefits from some time in bottle. Wood and fruit are integrated, bringing out the spice in the fruit, while leaving delicious apple and white currant fruits to blossom. Screwcap."
Syrah,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Mission Estate,29.0,92.0,"This is less luxuriantly ripe than some of the other 2013 Hawke's Bay Syrahs, showing some firm, dusty tannins on the finish, but it's still a terrific offering. Cracked black pepper, fresh blueberries and cedar notes come together beautifully on the palate, promising much for the future. Drink 2018–2025."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Siduri,29.0,92.0,"There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape. It lingers and opens into a mélange of red fruits, forest, leaf and loam, still stiff and compact after hours of breathing."
Riesling,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,29.0,92.0,"This radiant wine opens with heady aromas of white flower, honey, beeswax and citrus zest. The elegant palate shows class and pedigree, offering nectarine, aromatic herb and white stone fruit alongside lively acidity. An energizing mineral note closes the lingering finish."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Benvenuto de la Serna,29.0,92.0,"Trisagio is a Malbec-led blend with Cab Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It's a dense wine offering the full allotment of berry, earth and meaty aromas. Plump and layered across the palate, this tastes of chocolaty oak, baking spices, herbs, cassis and a pinch of salt. A long, pure finish is a nice topping; drink through 2021."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de la Villaudière,29.0,92.0,"Tensely mineral, this is a tight, crisp wine. The palate ranges from pink grapefruit to a more steely, stony texture. The acidity shooting through the wine is well in balance with the fruits and structure. It could go through 2015 to be even better."
Red Blend,US,California,Zenaida Cellars,29.0,92.0,"One of the least-expensive red blends the winery makes, this bottling of 50% Syrah, 30% Petite Sirah and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon shows blueberry, lavender, violets, ginger snap, oregano, leather, coffee and freshly baked croissant on the nose. It's layered on the sip, with dark chocolate, caramel, black-cherry juice, pork au jus and savory miso flavors."
Braucol,France,Southwest France,Domaine du Moulin,29.0,92.0,"This is a dark-colored wine, powerful and dense. With a fine perfumed character, it is rich with black fruits and concentrated from the low yields. It is impressive, ripe and darkly structured and with a firm long-lasting aftertaste. Still young and packed with fruit, it will be better from 2018."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Northstar,29.0,92.0,"This blend of Merlot (61%), Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Syrah (8%) and Petit Verdot brings notes of anise, black currant, herbs, mint and raspberries. The palate brings good depth of flavors and richness while showing both elegance and precision."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Avignonesi,29.0,92.0,"Aromas of underbrush, red berry, cooking spice and Mediterranean brush lead the nose on this structured, polished wine. The firm palate delivers wild cherry, tobacco, savory herb, white pepper and a balsamic note alongside supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,Gini,29.0,92.0,"This enticingly fragrant wine offers scents of white spring flower, apple, ginger and flint. On the elegantly structured palate, radiant acidity underscores crisp apple, Bosc pear, white peach and lemon drop, while a salty mineral note closes the tangy finish. It's an impressive effort for what was overall a washout vintage. Drink through 2024."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Hawk Watch Winery,29.0,92.0,"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Petite Sirah from the Warner Springs area southeast of Temecula shows lots of promise for this producer. Smoky berries, uncrushed black peppercorns and a bit of asphalt show on the nose, with juicy, plump red fruits benefitting from lots of cardamom, allspice and other black spices on the palate."
Syrah,US,California,Cedarville,29.0,92.0,"An aroma like charcoal and fennel leads to concentrated smoke and black-pepper flavors and a taut, tannic texture before more generous nuances like black cherry and savory lentils kick in. It's a fascinating wine that develops more layers and complexity as it breathes. Best after 2019."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Barrister,29.0,92.0,"The flagship bottling for this winery, this brings aromas of dried herbs, dark chocolate, espresso bean, black currant and cherry. The dark fruit flavors are rich and concentrated, possessing a layered mouthfeel that captures the attention."
Syrah,US,Oregon,Abacela,29.0,92.0,"This terrific wine is classically varietal, with beautifully defined flavors of cured meats, tobacco, coffee, lavender and peppercorn, all in service to ripe purple fruits. Impeccably balanced, it conveys finesse."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Other,Verum,29.0,92.0,"Cool, breezy Patagonia is the home address for this light-colored but full-flavored Cab Franc. Cherry, berry and woodsy aromas set up a firm, wide palate with lightly herbal, leafy flavors of berry fruits and chocolate. Cocoa dust and a pinch of saltiness are noted on a full finish. Drink through 2022."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,29.0,92.0,"The faintest hint of fir honey appears on the nose. Underneath that and on the palate apple fruit holds sway, presenting an interplay between ripe and tart flesh. The palate is dry but nonetheless has that touch of dark, bitter fir honey. This has drive and linearity and a lasting, clean, apple-fruited finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,29.0,92.0,"Earthy notes are mixed into the perfume of fleshy, ripe apricots, edged with baking spice. The palate plays on the same register of ripe stone fruit tempered by spice, earth and dried orange peel. This is dry and slender but incisive and concentrated—very grown up and appealing in a restrained, elegant fashion. The finish is clean and long. Drink 2016–2025."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Destro,29.0,92.0,"A blend of Carricante and Catarratto planted in high-altitude vineyards, this linear vibrant white offers delicate but enticing scents of Spanish broom, jasmine and orchard fruit. The bright delicious palate doles out creamy yellow apple, green pear and chopped mint while a mineral note underscores the finish. It's loaded with finesse."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Western Australia,Plantagenet,29.0,92.0,"Great Southern is an underrated source for Cabernet Sauvignon, amply demonstrated by this wine. Expansive notes of cedar, brown sugar, vanilla and baking spices enrobe tart berries, while the wine's firm structure carries through to a crisp, tannic finish. Try in 2020."
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Hillinger,29.0,92.0,"The nose is still closed: There is just a hint of dark fruit. The palate lightens with expressive and finely drawn fruit. There is pepper-tinged red cherry, fine notes of cranberry and red currant. The fruit here is beautiful and taut; there is freshness, tension and real elegance. Tannins are supple and fine, and the body is unforced and fresh."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Teso La Monja,29.0,92.0,"This open-knit, yet chunky Toro features sweet, oaky aromas of plastic, mocha and baked plum. Concentrated and creamy on the palate, it tastes of chocolate, vanilla and savory blackberry. Full, chunky and bold but balanced on the finish; drink through 2023."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kessler-Haak,29.0,92.0,"This is a solidly made wine that hits all the right notes. Hot toast, lemon curd and cut red apple show on the lush, perfectly ripe but not at all buttered nose. Key lime flesh and skins show on the balanced palate, where a touch of butter is cut by laser sharp acidity and chalky minerality."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine des Diables,29.0,92.0,"This rosé needs to age. It has a zesty, crisp and mineral texture that is tight and nervy. As it softens, more red fruits will come to the front, although the structure will remain, making this a serious rosé for drinking with food."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,29.0,92.0,"As usual, the Wairau Reserve is Saint Clair's biggest, plushest, most opulent Sauvignon Blanc bottling. Bold and unabashedly tropical in nature, it screams passion fruit aloud, then settles down into a mouthwatering, slightly chalky finish of immodest length."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Amavi,29.0,92.0,"Fragrant and young, this Cab bursts with juicy berry fruit flavors. Brambly raspberry, a whiff of mint, plenty of cassis and a dusting of spice all combine in a well-structured wine ready for the table. Firm and supported with mineral-soaked acids, this has the texture, tannins and push-through to age gracefully, though it's perfectly ready right now."
Nero d'Avola,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Curto,29.0,92.0,"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this delicious wine opens with ripe black plum, carob and Mediterranean brush aromas. The smooth, chewy palate doles out layers of juicy blackberry, ripe Morello cherry, clove and white pepper flavors. A licorice note closes the finish while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2022."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Eisenberg,Jalits,29.0,92.0,"An intriguing nose of slight but very pleasant smokiness with mere edges of peat and earth leads onto a notion of black cherry. The dark palate is framed by specks of pepper, bringing nuance to this structured wine. Still young, this wine has the ability to go some distance. Drink now-2019."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,DanCin,29.0,92.0,"The name references the mix of fermentation techniques—40% neutral oak, 40% stainless steel and 20% new French barrels. Peach and papaya fruit are accented by a light streak of honey and a whiff of wet stone. This is both nuanced and beautifully proportioned."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Oregon,Beresan,29.0,92.0,"Sourced from estate vineyards, this is aged in a mix of new and neutral French oak. Baking spices, gingerbread, cassis, earth, umami, soy and balsamic elements combine in a complex, distinctive and powerful wine with another decade of development ahead. Decant if drinking soon, or cellar until 2025."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Sol Rouge,29.0,92.0,"More flavorful than the rather light color might indicate, this sophisticated wine has wonderful, complex aromas like leather, tea and chocolate. Vibrant flavors of raspberry and pomegranate partner with an appetizingly dry and slightly tannic texture. It is medium to full bodied."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Hirsch,29.0,92.0,"Less aromatically forward than its peers, this suggests slightly riper fruit. A welcome mineral focus comes on the concentrated, textured palate that boasts zesty citrus peel and a wonderfully straight, upright backbone. This will come into its own by 2015–2016."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sextant,29.0,92.0,"This delivers a no-holds-barred Paso-style of richness, with black plum, vanilla, caramel, cola and cherry-filled ganache aromas leaping from the glass. It's soft and luxurious on the sip, with caramel-laced fudge, espresso cream, black-cherry sorbet and loads of milk-chocolate flavorings."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,29.0,92.0,"Sophisticated and complex, this brings well-structured layers of citrus juice, flesh and rind. It offers a delicate herbal touch and a lingering finish. As the wine evolves in the glass, a tasty hint of honeysuckle emerges."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,29.0,92.0,"Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 2017–2022."
Zinfandel,US,California,Seven Angels,29.0,92.0,"Coming from a vineyard named after the patron saint of night watchmen, this wine offers luxurious purple aromas of blackberry-vanilla sauce and dark chocolate. The palate is sticky and singing with coffee, milk chocolate and dried cherries, showing plenty of deep tannins and boisterous acidity that will make this bottling last a while."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Sainte Marguerite,29.0,92.0,"The palest of grey-pink rosés, this is classy, fresh and fragrant. It has a light, orange-zest texture as well as tannins and a mineral edge. Very fresh, it is also worth aging a few months."
Syrah,US,California,Boekenoogen,29.0,92.0,"Baked strawberries, peppercorns and lavender flowers converge for a dynamic nose on this bottling, which also offers scents of sea-salt caramel and toasted oak. There's lots of vibrancy to the sip, where beef char, oregano, marjoram and thyme give nuance to the full-bodied, black pepper-laced blackberry jam."
Syrah,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,29.0,92.0,"This deep black-cherry colored wine has a fruity nose of pomegranate and strawberry. It is smooth on the palate, with flavors of black currant, plum, white chocolate, lavender and a hint of baking spice. The finish is characterized by a splash of tart strawberry."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Tour de By,29.0,92.0,"The Pagès family, which has a group of estates in the Médoc, has produced a rich, concentrated wine at this château. While packed with black currant fruit from the 60% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, it also has a firm layer of tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2021."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Nino Franco,29.0,92.0,"Enticing scents of ripe orchard fruit, aromatic herb and fragrant white spring flower take center stage on this elegant sparkler. The generous palate doles out juicy white peach, ripe Granny Smith apple and tangerine zest. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while an elegant mousse imparts finesse."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Biondi,29.0,92.0,"Intense aromas of white spring flower, aromatic herb, exotic fruit and citrus seamlessly come together on this. The radiant, precise palate offers nectarine zest, lime, sage and white peach while a tangy saline note closes the lingering finish. Enjoy now or hold another few years for more complexity. Drink through 2020."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Cedarville,29.0,92.0,"Good depth of flavor and a sense of layering makes this wine especially enjoyable. A big aroma pulls in wood smoke, black pepper, black cherry, generous fruit flavors, dark chocolate and smoky accents."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,29.0,92.0,"The slightly off-dry profile (12g/L residual sugar) perfectly complements the ultraripe, deeply concentrated fruit. It's downright plush, with ripe apple and pear tart flavors. Young as it is, you may not want to wait to drink this one."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Roederer Estate,29.0,92.0,"Crisp peach and red-fruit flavors combine with vibrant acidity and energizing, fine bubbles to create a balanced and rich sparkling wine. A spicy, crisp fruit character lingers long on the finish."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,29.0,92.0,"Seeming delicate at first, barely-there whiffs of lemon peel and green herb turn riper and sunnier on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is quite unctuous, dripping with white peach and grapefruit nectar. A cool strike of steel extends from midpalate to finish, lending mineral elegance to this ripe, rich wine."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Destro,29.0,92.0,"Creamy wild cherry, crushed strawberry, exotic incense, clove and cinnamon-spice spill from the glass when you pour this delicious wine made on the slopes of Mount Etna. It's very youthful, with fresh red-berry fruit and bright acidity balanced by polished tannins. A licorice notes signals the close."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine des Chers,29.0,92.0,"Owner Arnaud Briday has made a firm structured cru wine. While it has the generous fruit of the year, it also has plenty of tannins that give it tension and concentration. The wine is rich with explosive berry fruits and balanced acidity. Drink from 2018."
Syrah,US,California,Alder Springs,29.0,92.0,"The intensely dark color, tight aromas of black pepper and clove, deep and very ripe fruit flavors and thick tannins add up to a big, bold wine that tastes more full-bodied than its moderate alcohol would indicate. It has vivid flavors like espresso, dark chocolate and a hint of candied fruit, yet is decidedly dry. It should be best after 2018, or enjoy now with hearty meats."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Carnuntum,Muhr-Van der Niepoort,29.0,92.0,"There is nothing obvious about this wine: everything is subtle and elegant. The nose holds back and the taut palate only unfurls slowly to show a floral, fruity wine that reminds one of crimson peony petals as much as of dark, juicy cherries. Yet there is nothing facile about this. It is the silky-smooth texture, however, that delivers the killer blow. A most sensuous, intriguing wine of great elegance. Little wonder: its name means silk and velvet"
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Trenel Fils,29.0,92.0,A firm and tannic wine from the most northerly of the Beaujolais cru villages near Bourgogne. Blackberry fruit and juicy acidity are a balance to this initially severe wine. Its dry core and mineral texture show that this wine will need to age. Drink from 2018.
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Don Manuel Villafañe,29.0,92.0,"This purple saturated Malbec opens with powerful aromas of cola, tree bark and spiced blackberry. A saturated, extracted, highly tannic palate amounts to a heavy load, while baked and blackened berry flavors include a strong shot of chocolate. On the finish, more chocolate along with fig and baked berry flavors seal this rich ripe offering. Drink through 2022."
Viura,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Murrieta,29.0,92.0,"Waxy aromas of dried stone fruits and potent oak open this classy barrel-fermented Viura. A refined palate with cutting acidity energizes woody pear and apple flavors. On the finish, resiny oak and a wave of oxidized Sherry notes are highly complex but maybe not for everyone."
Pinot Blanc,Austria,Burgenland,Prieler,29.0,92.0,"Ripe, tropical overtones of mango and passion fruit accompany the more usual ripe pear notes of this concentrated wine. There are mineral hints on the palate, where weight, flavor and freshness are in perfect accord. This is lovely now but will age very gracefully."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Joseph Jewell,29.0,92.0,"Scoring slightly higher than the Alderpoint vineyard-designated wine, this basic Humboldt County bottling bursts with with black cherry aroma. It's medium-bodied, free of oak-driven flavor and loaded with fruit. Lively acidity and mouth-filling texture keep the cherry and raspberry notes echoing through the finish, striking wonderful balance in an appetizing, mouthwatering package."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Puramun,29.0,92.0,"Potent, inky aromas of blackberry and licorice reflect this beefy Malbec's opaque black color. In the mouth, this is energetic and not just heavy and extracted. Lightly salted black-fruit flavors are lifted by acidity, while this finishes deep and strong. Drink through 2022."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Greywacke,29.0,92.0,"A relative bargain in the scheme of barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, Kevin Judd's version boasts toasty, nutty notes upfront, followed by creamy citrus and stone-fruit aromas and flavors. It's a top example of the richness and potential age-worthiness that oak can bring to carefully selected lots of Sauvignon Blanc."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Le Potazzine,29.0,92.0,"Structured but elegant, this weaves together sensations of tilled earth, forest floor, black cherry, raspberry, orange peel and nutmeg alongside supple tannins. It's vibrant and drinkable. Even though it will age moderately well, enjoy over the next few years to capture the fresh berry fruit."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot,29.0,92.0,"Quintessence is a good name for this wine that has the minerality and the structure that are the soul of the appellation. In addition it offers apricot and pear fruitiness and intense acidity. This wine is so drinkable now, although it will be much better from 2018."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Josef Jamek,29.0,92.0,"Notions of citrus peel and foliage, of ripe, red-cheeked little yellow mirabelle plums mix exoticism with the homely. Treading on light feet, almost on a tightrope, this is top-laden with fruit, yet focused and taut. A real flirt of a wine, but with serious intent."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Isole e Olena,29.0,92.0,"Here's a structured but elegant wine that opens with aromas of wild berry, mint, clove and a balsamic note. The firm, fresh palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry, menthol, white pepper, grilled herb and a note of well-integrated oak while velvety tannins provide support. It's great now but it will be even better in a few years. Drink through 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta das Marias,29.0,92.0,"This is seriously structured and firm with great aging potential. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, both grapes very much at home in the Dão, the wine is full of solid tannins, concentrated black fruits and a dark texture. Fermenting in open tanks has helped the wine gain its broad rich texture. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Pfister,29.0,92.0,"Almost tropical overtones on the nose announce ample pure fruit. Russet pear has both a touch of fresh Amalfi lemon and luscious honey. Yet the palate is slender, taut and dry. A lovely evocation of the varietal richness of Pinot Gris, framed on very light feet with elegance and poise. Totally appetizing, dry and moreish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Opolo,29.0,92.0,"This unabashedly powerful and jammy wine shows black-cherry candy, sweet roses, vanilla, black rocks and black pepper on the nose. The soft tannins carry forth waves of vanilla, coconut, caramel and blueberry jelly, perfect to please those seeking a whopper of a wine."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Ruby Hill Winery,29.0,92.0,"Big, richly fruity and quite tannic, this concentrated wine pulls off good balance, as the ripeness and near-sweetness of the fruit flavors seems to dissolve some of the firm grip in the texture. Aromas like tobacco, pencil lead and cedar keep coming as the wine opens up in the glass."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,29.0,92.0,"This is a flagship wine for DFJ owner and winemaker José Neiva Correia. It is generous while preserving great style and elegance. The black berry fruits and layers of tannins are well balanced with the acidity and the light wood aging. A wine to savor, it will be ready to drink from 2018."
Merlot,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,29.0,92.0,"This wine is dark garnet to the eye, with a fragrance of raspberry, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. There is a pleasing balance of fruit and dried herb notes. Smooth tannins prevail, with flavors of black cherry, blueberry, eucalyptus, smoked meat and fresh-cut herbs of thyme and oregano paving the way for a blueberry, oregano and orange rind finish."
Syrah,US,California,Sinor-LaVallee,29.0,92.0,"Blueberry, dark berries and tar swirl together on the nose of this hedonistic wine from Mike Sinor's Bassi Ranch property, located just 1.3 miles from the ocean at Shell Beach. It's rich, meaty and heavily spiced on the palate, with dark chocolate, cedar and plenty of blackberry, but the bitter and savory elements stop it short of being a fruit bomb."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Nino Franco,29.0,92.0,"Creamy and fresh, this off-dry sparkler offers heady aromas of exotic fruit, candied orange peel and ripe peach. The foaming palate doles out ripe apple, Bartlett pear and crystallized ginger alongside crisp acidity that gives it an almost linear quality."
Grenache,US,California,Kings Carey,29.0,92.0,"This bottling from John Sebastiano Vineyard is a great example of how a light Grenache can entertain needy palates. Sagebrush-laced aromas of wild thyme and tree bark mesh with tart pomegranate, red currant and a touch of red-cherry pie on the nose. The tea-leaf-laced sip shows raspberry, red plum and red apple, which just enough tannic structure."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,29.0,92.0,"There almost is the slightest touch of lovely Poire William spirit on the nose. This is a lovely pear-scented, dry wine of immense fruitfulness. A homely earthiness counteracts this and makes for a concentrated, medium-dry but mellow palate. The finish is off dry, lasting and mouthfilling. There is something immensely satisfying about this."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Henry Fessy,29.0,92.0,"This wine is structured and concentrated, showing a tight character that is closed and firm. It has enough fruit for the future to show its potential richness. Concentrated, very mineral, the wine should not be drunk until 2017."
Syrah,US,Oregon,Quady North,29.0,92.0,"Sourced from a cool site in this southern Oregon AVA, this compelling effort rewards both breathing time and extra attention. Classic funk/umami scents and flavors accompany tangy boysenberry fruit. Suggestions of roasted meat, allspice, licorice, espresso and iron filings fill in throughout a long and satisfying finish. This is a wine you may enjoy immediately and on through 2025."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram-Donauland,Anton Bauer,29.0,92.0,"Flint, ripe peaches and golden apricots with the merest hint of vanilla suggest the finest Viennese pastries. This well-judged and super-mellow wine is just rich enough, also giving hints of almond paste and lime peel. There is no heaviness, just velvety mouthfeel and sumptuous length."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Pulenta Estate,29.0,92.0,"The nose offers a fine mix of floral berry, dusty earth and classic Malbec richness, while the palate is juicy, balanced and tastes of cassis, blackberry, fresh plum, cracked pepper and baking spices. Full and long on the finish, and overall it's right where you want it to be. Drink now through 2011."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Waipara,Mountford,29.0,92.0,"This has really evolved over the past 10 months since I tasted it at the winery, going from crisp and pineapple-y then to more honeyed and tropical now, with opulent layers of peach and mango that coat the mouth on the long finish. Drink now."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Il Conventino,29.0,92.0,"Made from organically grown grapes, this wine boasts a refined bouquet of violet, iris and baking spices. The palate delivers a core of dark cherry and raspberry flavors with white pepper and a hint of herbs. It's elegant, with a bright, silky palate and nice length."
Port,Portugal,Port,Warre's,29.0,92.0,"The Warre's style is for unfiltered Late Bottled Vintages, which means they are can age in bottle. This wine, now released at 12 years is a case in point. In richness and in structure it is more like a fast aging Vintage Port. It is full of dark fruits, dense tannins and great concentration. A very fine wine, it is ready to drink."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,29.0,92.0,"Made from a blend of grapes from the estate's top vineyards, this vivacious dry Riesling balances crisp mineral tones against ripe, tropical notes of mango, pineapple and melon. It's lusciously mouthcoating yet cut with strikes of tangerine and lime. Delightful now, but structured enough to improve through at least 2023."
Viura,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Murrieta,28.0,92.0,"Aromas of wood grain, vanilla, butter and fino Sherry are elegant and attractive for this style of white Rioja. On the palate, this oak-aged Viura is smooth, while creamy flavors of oak, apricot and peach excel. A smooth finish with plenty of vanilla and core acidity indicates this will age well for another 10 years."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Rieflé,28.0,92.0,"This is a textured wine with ripe and perfumed fruitiness. Honeyed in style and medium-sweet on the palate, it's a complex, rich wine that's ready to drink now, but could also improve with age."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Perelada,28.0,92.0,"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty. Hard tannins and some chop on the finish suggest further aging would be beneficial. Drink this Cabernet-led blend that also includes Garnacha, Syrah, Merlot and Cab Franc through 2025."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Huët,28.0,92.0,Classic. Beautiful acidity is balanced by just a touch of sweetness. The wine is bright with apple and lime flavors.
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Fattorie Romeo del Castello,28.0,92.0,"This elegant, structured red opens with a potpourri of perfumed berry, wild flower and a whiff of cake spice. The juicy palate doles out black cherry, wild strawberry, cinnamon, star anise and menthol alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2022."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Cebada,28.0,92.0,"Very light pink, this rosé offers extremely pleasant and approachable aromas of nectarine, pluot, plum, lime and a dusting of vanilla. These give way to a light and bright palate, where lime zest cuts through a bubble gum core. Yeasty notes adds further nuance."
Sauvignon Blanc,Romania,Recas,Cramele Recas,28.0,92.0,"This late harvest Sauvignon Blanc is honey gold in color, with tantalizing aromas of honeysuckle, white flowers and lanolin. It is generous on the palate, with flavors of apricot and tinned peaches supported by floral notes. Its sweetness is enhanced by a pleasing level of acidity on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Cartuxa,28.0,92.0,"Named after the city of Evora, capital of Alentejo and close to the winery, this is a finely made impressive wine. While it is rich, it's ripe, smooth and packed with berry fruits as well as balanced tannins. It is still developing and although it can be drunk soon, it will be better aged for several more years. Ideally, wait until 2018."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Western Cape,Jean Daneel,28.0,92.0,"This oaked Chenin shows great structure and power now, with the potential to cellar nicely for another three years or beyond. Toasted brioche, wood-grilled peaches and quince aromas open up immediately on the bouquet and carry through to the palate alongside seductive accents of sweet spice, almond skin and orange oil. The texture is round and full, and the spice-driven finish is long and satisfying."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,28.0,92.0,"This is a tight, black-fruited wine, with generous flavors that include espresso and licorice. At first it's quite firm and a bit unyielding, it slowly peels open layer after layer, tossing out hints of dried herb, tobacco and mocha."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Brandl,28.0,92.0,"An almost honeyed nose tells of the 2015 ripeness, but instead leads to a concentrated palate that intriguingly combines peppery spice, savory herbs and rich mellow yeast. All this richness is tempered by a streamlined lemony acidity. This is savory, so make sure to pair it with subtle, expressive food. What a joy."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Durant,28.0,92.0,"This single-clone, estate-grown wine shows exemplary concentration. Deeply sculpted fruit flavors roll from peach to papaya, with streaks of buttery caramel. Everything is in proportion, with a most pleasing finish."
Moscatel,Spain,Northern Spain,Ochoa,28.0,92.0,"This smells like orange marmalade. It feels smooth and creamy, but not terribly thick due to fine acidity, with flavors of orange, honey, peach and spice. Long and creamy on the finish, this is a fresh, delicious wine that should impress anyone with a sweet tooth."
Viognier,US,California,Sol Rouge,28.0,92.0,"This puff-pastry of a wine has a vivid gold color, enticing bread-dough aromas and lush texture. Ripe peach and honey flavors are layered with butterscotch and mineral notes that lead to a lingering finish. Full-boded, well-balanced and delightful."
Chardonnay,US,California,Mercy,28.0,92.0,"Light and delicate aromas of lime curd, vanilla yogurt and a touch of pear custard show in a very pleasing manner on the nose of this vineyard-blend bottling. The palate is expertly rounded, with wet riverstone, yellow apple, lime zest and creamy white fruit like cherimoya and ripe nectarine."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Schmitges,28.0,92.0,"This is an exotic, flashy wine, marked by layers of ripe, sweet tropical fruit. Honey, peaches and mangoes are plump and mouthfilling, but end with elegance and finesse, making for a finely balanced wine worthy of the two-star accolade."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Kurt Hain,28.0,92.0,"Rich, viscous and sweet, this is a spätlese that punches above its weight. A bit of dried apricot hints at the inclusion of some botrytized grapes, while the rest of the fruit shows superripe flavors of peaches and honey. This is long on the finish, clinging to the palate. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Merlot,US,California,Ballentine,28.0,92.0,"This concentrated Merlot is blended with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Dense in black licorice and toasty oak, the fruit character is dominated by red plum and berry aromas and flavors."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ridge,28.0,92.0,"A vineyard blend that includes 16% Petite Sirah, 2% Carignane, 4% Mataro and 1% Alicante Bouschet. Meaty, funky and ripe, with intense fruit, lots of earthy, barnyardy accents, and a long, tannic finish. This is old style Zin, no holds barred, with full-throttle flavors for aficionados."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Domaine Divio,28.0,92.0,"Made with a minimal-intervention mind-set, this marries classic French winemaking to tight, almost steely Willamette Valley fruit. It's a taut, tense wine, focused on raspberry/cherry fruit, with firm, chocolate-tinged tannins. Highlights of malted milk and tobacco sneak into the extended finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Judean Hills,Jerusalem Wineries,28.0,92.0,"Inky-ruby colored, this wine has a complex bouquet of strawberry, watermelon, chocolate, violet and bell pepper. There is a nice interplay of fruit and cool herb notes, featuring flavors of black cherry, orange zest, eucalyptus and mint. A strong but subdued network of tannins recedes at the finish, making way for a pleasing jolt of bright acidity."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Salcheto,28.0,92.0,"You'll discover alluring aromas of grilled herb, saddle leather, cured meat and ripe berry in this enticing red. The palate is succulent and juicy, offering red cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and clove flavors. It's buttressed by bright acidity and youthfully firm, refined tannins for balance and a structure built for ageing. Drink 2018–2028."
Syrah,US,California,Fenestra,28.0,92.0,"This late-release wine from a Livermore stalwart smells spicy and exotically fruity, with herbal/menthol and cigar box accents. On the palate it is rich, generous, deep and broad-textured, lush in feel and full-bodied. The essence is like warm blackberry jam but without being sweet. All the goodness lingers on finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Alpha Crucis,28.0,92.0,"While the trend among many Australian Cabernets is towards moderate, silky tannin structures, this austere, firm wine embraces its dry, dusty nature. Cedar and toast frame big cassis fruit, ending with chewy tannins. Drink 2018–2028."
Syrah,US,Washington,Kevin White,28.0,92.0,"A blend of fruit from Olsen, Elephant Mountain and Boushey vineyards, this wine is expressive, with aromas of smoke, high-toned herb, dark raspberry, blue fruit and mineral. The flavors are fresh and focused, putting a premium on elegance with a finish that sails."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Bonny Doon,28.0,92.0,"Crisp and clean aromas of chalk and lime pith meet with riper touches of honeydew and Anjou pear on the nose of this blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Roussanne, which hints at a biting acidity on the sip. The freshness extends to the palate, where riper guava tones are deftly cut by citrus peels and finished with a minty lift. The structure is tense and ideal, while the acidity is available but not overwhelming."
Nebbiolo,US,California,Prima Materia,28.0,92.0,"Showing great restraint and structure, this wine is complex, savory and brings a welcome change from the usual fruity soft California wine. It smells lightly spicy, beefy and earthy, tastes mild but deep, with fascinating flavors like smoked meat, tea, raspberry and cola."
Grenache,US,California,Calavera Wines,28.0,92.0,"An intoxicatingly sensual Grenache, velvety and light in cherry and strawberry fruit, smooth earth, a streak of anise and deep swirls of chocolate and caramel on the finish. The Dalton Vineyard in Calaveras County has been one to watch for in Syrah and Zinfandel; it can now add Grenache."
Merlot,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,28.0,92.0,"Tamarack blends grapes from an astonishing number of sites scattered across the length and breadth of the Columbia Valley, and yet makes wines that are distinctive, polished, generous, and focused. The 2008 Merlot includes 5% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Its structure is firmly Cab-like, its fruit broadly displayed across the midpalate, a mix of ripe strawberries and cherries dusted with sweet baking spices and cocoa. It's a joyride from start to finish."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Commanderie de la Bargemone,28.0,92.0,"At five years, this balanced, ripe wine is both elegant and concentrated. Fine tannins support the red cherry and black berry fruits, with layers of acidity and minerality. The wine, well balanced, is ready to drink."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Summerer,28.0,92.0,"Beautifully smooth, this ripe wine contrasts its rich peach and pineapple flavors with a squeezed lime note and taut acidity. With its intensely-fruity finish, this is a wine for aging."
Merlot,US,Washington,Dumas Station,28.0,92.0,"Three quarters Merlot, with 17% Cabernet Franc and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a bit lighter than the 2007 Merlot, but just as good, if not better. Lush and loaded with black cherry, blackberry, cocoa and baking spices, it extends deliciously and seamlessly into a long, ripe, smooth finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,28.0,92.0,"From old vines dating to 1865, this is a hugely fragrant mountainous Zinfandel, with an abundance of raspberry and blackberry flavors. A wine with a huge presence and soft, rounded tannins, it's extremely yummy with a ton of peppery spice on the long finish."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Teso La Monja,28.0,92.0,"This has an opaque purple color, with a supremely concentrated and potent dark-fruited bouquet. Feels amped up, warm and exotic, with black fruit flavors alongside notes of peppery spice and bitter chocolate. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2016."
Tinto del Pais,Spain,Northern Spain,Traslanzas,28.0,92.0,"By far this is the best Traslanzas I've come across. It is pure, with aromas of cola, mineral, black cherry and the mildest note of raisin. On the palate, it feels concentrated, with big tannins pushing sweet, dark flavors of blackberry, fig, chocolate and licorice. Tastes lightly toasted and feels big on the finish. Drink now through 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Alexana,28.0,92.0,"Rich, medium dry, and loaded with lemon, orange and citrus scents and flavors, this is a marvelous wine graced with a lush, textural, mineral-drenched mouthfeel. Despite the low alcohol there is just the gentlest touch of sweetness from 8 g/L residual sugar."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Casa al Vento,28.0,92.0,"Aria is a stunning Chianti Classico, boasting earthy, underbrush aromas with hints of subdued oak. The palate delivers fabulous, juicy plum and black-cherry layered with well integrated vanilla and espresso. It's still tight and tannic so give this a few more years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Cadence,28.0,92.0,"This blend of Cabernet Franc (46%), Merlot (28%), Cabernet Sauvignon (17%) and Petit Verdot (9%) starts out brooding, with black cherry, herb, black currant, anise, and spice notes. The palate is rich and structured, loaded with dark fruit flavors and firm tannins. Give it some time to open up."
Nero d'Avola,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Valle dell'Acate,28.0,92.0,"Ripe dark-skinned berry, underbrush, new oak, vanilla leather, sage and cured meat aromas meld in the glass. The full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, raisin, fig, licorice and exotic spice alongside velvety tannins."
Merlot,US,Washington,Stevens,28.0,92.0,"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars. The cool site brings out some of the floral and citrus accents often missing from Merlot, and the darker cherry and plum fruit flavors fill in right behind. Supple and sensuous, this is a wine to savor and, if possible, cellar for another decade."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,28.0,92.0,"Cab Franc is often chewy, tannic, herbal, but rarely luscious, as it is here. The addition of 12% Merlot softens up the middle, but the Franc is the show, with a dazzling display of blueberry, boysenberry, raspberry, coffee, tobacco leaf, lead pencil and more."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Blanco Nieva,28.0,92.0,"This gets going with apple, peach and mineral aromas that are pure and alluring. It feels lifted but a little creamy, with green banana, lime, orange and kiwi flavors. Solid and long on the finish; this is exemplary unoaked Verdejo."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Alloro,28.0,92.0,"Barrel fermented and put through full malolactic with regular batonnage, this superbly balanced, graceful Chardonnay is orchestrated around a complex mix of pear, tropical fruit, biscuit, cream soda and light baking spices. The acidity carries a hint of mineral, and the palate impression is lively and smooth."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Campolargo,28.0,92.0,"Big, ripe and bold, this powerful wine is dense with acidity and black fruits in equal measure. With its dark, tannic aftertaste, it's a wine to age further. Drink from 2015."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Hirsch,28.0,92.0,"Clean-cut and zesty with the tang of grapefruit peel, a concentrated midpalate and a refreshing dryness, this Riesling shows elegance, power and lip-smacking lemon finish. Shy now, it will reveal more power with bottle age. Drink as of 2017."
Syrah,US,Washington,Upland Estates,28.0,92.0,"It's a shame that so little of this wine is made, as it is a textbook example of a powerful, beautifully balanced Syrah from this tiny AVA in the heart of the Yakima Valley. Black fruits abound, wrapped in a firm, muscular, polished package by fine-grained tannins and a dark chocolate finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Vesuvio,28.0,92.0,"The second wine of Quinta do Vesúvio, Pombal is still concentrated and dense from low yielding vines. Layers of juicy plum flavors and acidity gain strength and power from the dense, sweet tannins. It will need to age a few years, so drink from 2017."
Gewürztraminer,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Klaus Lentsch,28.0,92.0,"Rich but refined, it opens with an enticing floral fragrance of white roses and stone fruit. The fresh palate offers white peach, tropical fruit, pineapple and pink grapefruit accented with clove and nutmeg."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Dão,Ideal Drinks,28.0,92.0,"Dark and dry, it has excellent potential. Pure Touriga Nacional gives its signature firm mineral tannins and and a rich, tarry underlying fruit character. Powerful now, it will be richer in the future. Drink from 2017."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,II Moons,28.0,92.0,"An eminently drinkable blend of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc, this shows a delicate honey aroma on the nose, along with apricot-filled brioche and sweetly cooked chanterelle mushrooms. It's very light and restrained on the palate. Nectarine flesh, yellow peaches and dried mango gain structure and depth from a lime peel tartness and chalky minerality."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carlisle,28.0,92.0,"This is the deal of the century for wine made at this level from vines dating back as far as 1881, the wine sourced from two sites, the Saitone and Banfield ranches. Yeasty baked bread and juicy strawberry commingle around black currant and blood orange, the texture smoothly seductive, with a cradling of dried herb as a back note."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Gramercy,28.0,92.0,"There's no mistaking the variety, with plentiful aromas of fresh herb and cherry alongside vanilla and light barrel accents. The dark fruit flavors are supple with a mesmerizing texture and an exquisite balance that extends through the coffee-filled finish. The attention to detail throughout is impressive, especially for a wine at this price."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,28.0,92.0,"Fermented in neutral puncheons, this is a dense, rich and mouth-coating wine that ups the bar for Oregon Pinot Gris. The neutral wood aging expands the breadth and texture. There's a rich mix of apple, jicama and Bosc pear fruit, lightly touched with wood highlights, and finishing with a lick of buttery caramel."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa de Santar,28.0,92.0,"A deep, concentrated, impressive wine that works on many levels. There are the blackberry fruits, almost jammy, that are enhanced by the tobacco and new wood flavors. Then there is the strong, underlying dryness that promises considerable aging. And there is the elegance. A smooth wine whose tannins work around the core of structure and style."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Borgo Scopeto,28.0,92.0,"Fantastic modern Chianti! Young but already exuding powerful berry fruit along with loads of cigar box and other attractive spices. The present tense of this wine is all about layered, climbing complexity. Its future is all but ensured, with its tight core, solid wall of tannins and a deep, black cherry finish that lasts a good two minutes."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,28.0,92.0,"Tart and tangy, these recently grafted Riesling vines deliver just-ripe flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, grapefruit and pineapple. It's close to a fruit bomb, but the significant acid underpinning keeps it juicy and gives it extra lift."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,Adega Mãe,28.0,92.0,"This is a smooth creamy blend of Viosinho, Alvarinho and Chardonnay. It is delicately poised, just hinting at vanilla while really emphasizing the crisp, clean and refreshing fruits. Acidity and a final orange zest flavor give it a refreshing aftertaste."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,28.0,92.0,"Some hints of sweetness and a touch of minerality annotate this wine, which bursts with flavors of peaches and tangerines. It's dry enough to pair with most Riesling friendly fare, and in many ways the most accessible and fruit-forward of Trisaetum's eight Rieslings."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,28.0,92.0,"Among the four Rieslings designated as off dry, this shows the most sweetness on the palate, with a slightly granular mouthfeel, like crystallized cane sugar. It accents the round fruit flavors of Meyer lemon and satsuma orange, which overflow the midpalate and run into a lingering finish with a touch of orange pekoe tea."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,28.0,92.0,"While the nose of this ethereal, lithe Riesling is a bit bashful, glorious shades of tangerine, quince and peach await on the palate. High-toned acidity pierces through sweet honey and nectar, darting into a long, minerally finish. It's stunning now, but should develop with integrity for at least another decade."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Valle dell'Acate,28.0,92.0,"Made from a blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato, this gorgeous wine offers intense fragrances of blue flower, forest floor, pine sap and woodland berry. The smooth, juicy palate delivers concentrated raspberry and black cherry flavors, with hints of licorice and Mediterranean herbs."
Syrah,US,Washington,Basel Cellars,28.0,92.0,"Full in the mouth, rich with a mix of pastry fruits, fruitcake, baking spices, clove and coffee, this decadent pleasure is like drinking a Christmas cake. Raisins soaked in a Bourbon sauce come to mind, along with plum pudding."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Waters,28.0,92.0,"This wine is half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (31%), Cabernet Franc (16%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Malbec. It draws you into the glass with high-toned aromas of dried herbs, espresso, red and black fruit, along with floral notes. The palate is poised and polished, showing depth, texture and layering well beyond its weight class. It appeals on every level."
White Blend,US,Washington,Waters,28.0,92.0,"The aromas pop on this blend of Alder Ridge Roussanne (57%) and Antoine Creek Viognier, with perfumed notes of flowers, pear and peach, along with light herb and spice grace notes. Palate coating, it brings a sense of gravitas and delight. It's fruitful and flavorful, offering richness while retaining its deftness, with a sense of texture that is knee buckling."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,28.0,92.0,"New-wood dominates this wine, with a very toasty quality, a seemingly sweet vanilla flavor and a touch of pepper from the alcohol. The black fruits are still burried under the wood character, although the fruits' weight suggests they will broaden out with time. Give this powerful effort at least four years."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Bodkin,28.0,92.0,"Acidic on the nose, like a cider, this late-harvest wine made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc retains 130 g/L residual sugar, and is rounded and plush. Appropriately sweet, it is completely balanced, tasting purely of baked pear, finding a hint of nutmeg on the lengthy finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Grant Burge,28.0,92.0,"This full-bodied, creamy-textured Shiraz from the Lyndoch subregion of the Barossa starts off with vanilla, raspberries and a dusting of confectioner's sugar, but turns darker and more savory with air, adding dark berry and hickory notes. The long finish is richly textured, yet simultaneously marked by crisp acids."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Portal,28.0,92.0,"A powerful wine, certainly, although in the elegant style of Quinta do Portal. Big black berry and plum flavors wrap around tannins that are still young, exuberant, needing time to settle down. The acidity and the solid tannic structure suggest good aging."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,92.0,"Plump and powerful yellow plum and cherry flavors seem peppered by spice and tea leaves in this lithe but penetrating wine. Sunny, ripe flavors don't detract from the 2014 vintage's trademark acidity—the finish is pure citrus refreshment. Drink now through 2020."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Rolland,28.0,92.0,"Concentrated blackberry and desert brush aromas are dense and intense. While this is very rich, it's not overbearing or out of whack. Blackberry flavors with savory spice and earth notes end toasty but not overly complex. Drink through 2019."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Arndorfer,28.0,92.0,"Glorious perfume emanates from the nose, suggesting that cologne-like blend of citrus with far more mellow notes of musk and pine. The palate reveals a repository of ripe, yellow plum, and of bouncy, fleshy juiciness. A fresh seam of acidity culminates in a lip-smacking finish on this perfumed, light-bodied Riesling."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Norton,28.0,92.0,"Rock solid, clean and composed. For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer, and the '05 is as good as past vintages. Look for bold berry flavors accented by medicinal, herbal notes. And then comes a finish that's chewy and round. This is like a fat fastball in the proverbial wheel house; just see it and swing away."
Sylvaner,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,28.0,92.0,"A lovely mix of aromas appears on the nose: a touch of sandalwood amidst fresh greenery—something at once sonorous and very fresh. The gentle and mostly subtle sandalwood notes continue across the palate, with a touch of mace, alongside something tenderly green, like aloe vera and chervil. This is a most unusual and most intriguing wine. If you were wondering about Sylvaner, here's one to mesmerize you."
Chardonnay,US,California,Baileyana,28.0,92.0,"A pithy tangerine aroma meets with yellow melon, sharp lemon and lime rinds, oak shavings and yeasty toast on the nose of this bottling by Christian Roguenant. There is a sharpness to the palate, with strong acidity and a grippy texture framing margarita-like flavors of salt and citrus."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Murrieta,28.0,92.0,"Murrieta's wines have been on a good run in recent years, as evidenced by this saturated, fleshy Reserva. The nose delivers berry and cherry aromas, with ample oak. The palate is a full-volume bonanza of berry flavors framed by briary spice and toasty oak. A naturally spicy, ripe finish confirms its excellence; drink 2018–2026."
Dolcetto,Italy,Piedmont,Marcarini,28.0,92.0,"One of Italy's most fascinating wines, this rare red is made from the grapes of 100-year-old, ungrafted vines. It opens with intense, inviting violet, dark spice and woodland berry aromas that carry over to its smooth, juicy palate, along with ripe Morello cherry, cranberry and ground pepper notes."
Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,US,Washington,Lauren Ashton Cellars,28.0,92.0,"Excellent texture and overall balance typify all of the wines from this exciting new producer. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, this brings a mix of melon, apple, herb and grass into play. Zippy, citrusy acids add zesty minerality as the wine rolls into a rocking finish, with just a hint of barrel toast."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,28.0,92.0,"Delicious in cola spice and earthy tannins, this medium-bodied Zinfandel remains tightly wound but obvious in its promise of years of enjoyably structured blackberry fruit, leather and spice. A fine choice among all of Easton's 2010 Zinfandels."
Riesling,Austria,Vienna,Mayer am Pfarrplatz,28.0,92.0,"Bright, almost luminous Meyer lemon and orange hover like a halo. The palate intensifies this ripe but zesty purity even more. The fruit is pulled into lemony focus at the concentrated core of this sleek, moreish Viennese original."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,28.0,92.0,"This is the first vintage for this blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Sangiovese. Ripe, lush and complex, it offers flavors of plum and cassis, with an appealing texture and moderately gripping tannins. There's life and snap to the finish, and though it's already delicious just two years after the vintage, another year or two of bottle age should see it continue to improve."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Mud House,28.0,92.0,"This wine reflects many of the refinements that have crept into New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc over recent years. There's just a hint of sweatiness, not out-of-control thiols, and the texture is silky, giving a rich feel without requiring high alcohol levels. Gooseberries and pink grapefruit round to the flavor profile, ending on a clean, refreshing note."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Jean-Max Roger,28.0,92.0,"Typical of Pouilly Fumé in its dense texture and flavor, this ripe wine has a smoky character that comes from the flint soil, which also adds its tight, mineral texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
Syrah,US,California,Tensley,28.0,92.0,"Opaque and almost black in the glass, this young bottling shows savory aromas of roasted meat, crushed slate, dark chocolate, fresh thyme and green peppercorns. Ripe black fruit flavors leap from the glass, bringing layers of thyme, pepper and Indian spice, all framed by bright acidity. Ready to enjoy now."
Zinfandel,US,California,Kokomo,28.0,92.0,"This impresses in graceful red berry, dried herb and wild vanilla, each component complementing the next. Well integrated and well made, this is a lengthy, complex and delicious wine that'll please a range of palates in search of moderate ripeness."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud,28.0,92.0,"Produced from a small vineyard in Pouilly Fuissé, this rich wine is full of ripe, generous fruit. Spice and yellow-fruit flavors blend seamlessly with the soft texture and perfumed acidity. It is developing into a very fine wine, ready to drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,Wood Family Vineyards,28.0,92.0,"A vivid yellow-gold color and creamy, butterscotchy flavors pile up the richness in this full-bodied wine. Great underlying acidity lifts up the wine for good balance and a lasting, tingly finish. The concentration and creaminess are wonderful to taste."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,28.0,92.0,The ripeness of pear and mirabelle is expressed with softness and gentleness. The nose is most inviting and leads to a more defined palate that also holds savory yeast and white pepper that appears in textured lemony waves. Beautiful and expressive.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Hirsch,28.0,92.0,"First a faint touch of flint and smoke appears, followed by subtle notes of green pear. Still fairly closed, the wine shows a tight body that will loosen into plumper ripeness. Intimations of orange peel and golden pear promise a great wine with a rich mouthfeel and cleansing acidity."
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Anita und Hans,28.0,92.0,"Fleshy blueberries are met with soft vanilla notes on this full-fruited yet light-footed red. On the palate the bursting blueberry notes are even more appetizing and joined by pleasant pepper with just a hint of tobacco. There is something rather seductive about these fruit-driven reds that deliver more than simple fruit. Utterly delicious, very elegant and dangerously drinkable."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Principiano Ferdinando,28.0,92.0,"This elegant, medium-bodied Nebbiolo starts off with aromas of berry, herb, leather and violet. The savory, polished palate delivers wild raspberry, mint, cake spice and a balsamic note alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,28.0,92.0,"While lithe and delicate in mouthfeel, this dazzling wine packs a punch with sun-kissed peach and apricot flavors. High-toned lime notes cut through the palate like a razor, leading a long, honey-kissed finish. Impeccably balanced, it's full of vibe and refreshment."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Gorman,28.0,92.0,"This wine is 100% varietal, all aged in once-used French oak. It's packed to the brim with black fruit, herbs, licorice, jalapeño pepper and barrel spices, with crystalline clarity to the aromas. There's plenty of depth and richness to the full-bodied flavors, with exquisite balance and a finish that lingers."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Alorna,28.0,92.0,"Named in homage to a Marquesa de Alorna who was a poet in the 18th century, this wood-aged rich wine is serious and complex. It has ripe yellow fruits that balance with the spice from the wood aging, giving a ripe creamy wine that will still age. Drink from 2017."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Gustafson Family,28.0,92.0,"Violets and white pepper intrude pleasantly on the nose of this estate-grown wine, accented by 10% Zinfandel. Layered and mischievously elegant despite its size, it's drinkable now, as satisfying as a piece of blueberry pie, and yet structured. It's a fine wine to lie down, through 2022."
Chardonnay,US,California,City Winery of New York,28.0,92.0,"This is a lovely vineyard-designate, floral and crisp in tangy grapefruit and tangerine. With plenty of complexity to its breadth and depth, it maintains effortless acidity throughout, finishing with just the right twist of lemon peel."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Baumard,28.0,92.0,"This is a rich, beautifully textured dry wine. It is terroir-driven, with the volcanic soil of Savennières underlying the tight texture. By contrast, it offers hints of honey and flavors of yellow fruits balanced with fruity lemon flavors. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Bethel Heights,28.0,92.0,"An outstanding value in a top-level Oregon Chardonnay, this beautifully rendered, barrel-fermented wine is a showcase of sharply defined flavors. The tree fruits are highlighted with details of spice and new wood, clearly delineated and well-matched."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),28.0,92.0,Fresh lemon and lime on the nose amass luscious tones of peach and apricot on the palate of this gossamer-light Riesling. It's penetrating and juicy yet anchored firmly by darts of laser acidity and dusty mineral complexities. Sweet honey tones linger long through the finish.
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,L'Enclos des Braves,28.0,92.0,"From a small 19-acre estate, this is a fruity and juicy blend of Braucol and the still rare Prunelard. It has a tannic stalky edge that suggests the wine can still develop. This serious concentrated wine was made in egg-shaped cement tanks and is from organic grapes. Drink from 2019."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Bellevue la Forêt,28.0,92.0,"The top wine from this estate is impressive. It has rich black fruits and firm tannins, showing its youthfulness. Its weight and concentration combine with the ripe fruits to give a wine that is destined for long-term aging. Négrette, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon go into this fine blend. Drink it from 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Grassini,28.0,92.0,"Fresh and inviting on the nose, this bottling shows sweet white flowers, Asian pear, yellow-grapefruit rind and lemon blossoms on the nose. Acidity explodes onto the palate, where a grassy, grapefruit-pith-driven tension rides into a rounded midpalate full of pear, nectarine and honeydew flavors."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Emina,28.0,92.0,"Just right on the nose, with a smoky, attractive set of deep berry aromas. The palate is pure and composed, with a pure, tasty mix of berry fruit, cocoa and mild oak. Smooth, long and creamy on the finish, and delicious overall. Best wine to date from Emina. Drink now into 2012."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,28.0,92.0,"Powerful yet restrained, this wine beautifully expresses the delicate and nuanced aspects of Cabernet Sauvignon with the herbal side of the grape in full force. Everything is tied together in a neat and tidy bundle, with sweet blackberry fruit surrounded by leaf and earth, leading into ripe but stiff tannins and just the right elements of mocha toast. Will it age? Undoubtedly; but hard not to drink it right now."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,28.0,92.0,"Continuing in a tart and juicy vein, as in previous years, this boasts a concentrated and immaculate palate layered with citrus, peach and melon. The abundant fruit is perfectly supported by mouth-puckering (in a good way) natural acidity."
Syrah,US,California,DeTierra Vineyards,28.0,92.0,"Condensed violets and rose petals greet the nose on this wine from an appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. Other aromas suggest grape candy, blackberry jam, anise and a touch of bacon fat. It's lively on the medium-bodied palate, with olallieberries, black pepper and crushed dill, proving very flavorful."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Raventós I Blanc,28.0,92.0,"Whatever the secret, it's working: year after year, de Nit excels. This vintage is typically crisp and focused up front, with aromas of dried cherry, orange, vanilla and wood spice. Elegant and crystal clear on the palate, this light rosé tastes of tangerine, plum skins and white pepper. A long, unbreakable finish only helps it along."
Riesling,Canada,Ontario,Cave Spring,28.0,92.0,"The low-yielding vines average 35 years of age, and their flavors are subtle yet distinctive. This wine unfolds slowly and almost imperceptibly, with subtle minerality around flavors of citrus pith and rind. It's tart and racy, with a lick of Key lime through the finish."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Oregon,Cowhorn,28.0,92.0,"This is a co-ferment (with native yeast) of 45% Viognier, 30% Marsanne and 25% Roussanne. Exceptional details and mouth-pleasing textures lend extra pleasure throughout this Rhône white blend. Green melon, cucumber and tart tropical fruits carry the succulent and refreshing palate on through a deep dive into an immaculate finish."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Watermill,28.0,92.0,"Wonderfully complex aromatics show a lovely floral note of fresh violets, married to scents of dusty tannins. Supple purple fruits combine with clove and other spices in a svelte wine with a full spectrum of flavors, from flower to fruit to cocoa powder."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Oregon,Cowhorn,28.0,92.0,"This blend of 55% Viognier, 30% Marsanne and 15% Roussanne has never been better. It's loaded with juicy stone fruits, accented with hints of tea tree oil and lemon verbena. A streak of black tea comes in gracefully as well, and along with its own unique flavor profile, it has the length and supple power of a very fine Chardonnay."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,28.0,92.0,"Production of this barrel-fermented reserve is roughly half of what it was in 2013, and in this instance, less is more. A sleek, sophisticated effort, it's bursting with flavors of pear flesh and skin, set against a wash of stony minerality. It's leesy, long and luscious."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,28.0,92.0,"The third (and newest) of Trisaetum's estate vineyards, Wichman's grafted-on Riesling vines (originally Pinot Gris) have found their grip in 2014. Citrus, pink grapefruit and citrus peel components pile on more subtle details of orange rind, mineral and a whiff of vanilla wafer. The acids are juicy and the finish has a crisp, lemony tang."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Larrivaux,28.0,92.0,"This wine's black currant aromas shine. It's still young and structured, its firm tannins at the fore. But those black currant flavors are crisp and fruity, highlighting its fine balance, as all the elements fall into place. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bailiwick,28.0,92.0,"This has a traditional medium-garnet color with brick rim. Effusive aromas that are smoky, beefy and earthy lead to distinctive wild berry, sage and cherry flavors. The texture is smooth but nicely supported by acid and tannins, and all the complexity of this wine lingers on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Talbott,28.0,92.0,"Bright raspberry aromas are cut by a slightly funky touch of composting violets, dried bay leaf and animal hide on this deeply layered bottling from the legendary producer. The palate is equally complex, with mulberry, tangy cranberry, juniper and earthy mushrooms. It offers a great experience for the price."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Mercy,28.0,92.0,"This wine comes from three vineyards that sit atop a dry, ancient riverbed. The nose mixes sour cherry and toasted vanilla bean with scents of ginger and turned earth, while a soft mouthfeel frames flavors of cherry cola and beet juice."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Numanthia,28.0,92.0,"This is a ripe, dark but balanced Toro with pastry, prune, blackberry and vanilla aromas. The palate is fiercely tannic on the surface but not overly hard at the foundation. Flavors of burnt toast, blackberry, spice, licorice and chocolate finish warm, toasty and dark, with echoes of ripeness and hard tannins. Drink now through 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,28.0,92.0,"Fresh yellow peaches seem to be layered in honey and pollen throughout this lusciously sweet, lip-smacking Riesling. The midpalate bristles with acidity, but it's harmoniously balanced, bursting of fresh apples and lemons. The finish is elegant and long, laced in soft tea tannins."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Weingut Karp-Schreiber,28.0,92.0,"Textbook fruchtig Riesling—but with the volume turned up to 11. The flavors of honeyed apple, nectarine and lime are sweet and the wine round and plump in the mouth, but then electric acids kick in, providing great balance through the long finish. Exciting to try now, but this wine should age 10-plus years without any trouble at all."
Syrah,US,California,Helwig,28.0,92.0,"Generous and layered, this wine smells like blackberries and tastes equally fruity until spicy cinnamon, clove and cedar nuances add complexity and depth. The texture is velvety and mouthcoating, helping all that flavor linger though the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Fenestra,28.0,92.0,"Dark, concentrated and practically dripping with ripe berry flavors, this wine shows the benefit of extra aging. It is unusually focused and delicious. Hints of cocoa and coffee join the dark blueberry and blackberry-syrup flavors, with very little evidence of oak."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,28.0,92.0,"This is the reserve-level Pinot Gris, comprised of lots from five different vineyards. Juicy, succulent and quite tart fruit flavors emphasize fresh apples and pears, lightly dusted with cinnamon spice. The concentration and lingering finish prove it worthy of its reserve status."
Primitivo,US,California,Santa Barbara Winery,28.0,92.0,"From the property of a longtime vineyard manager for the winery, this bottling is deliciously unique. The nose abounds with earth, dried cherry, anise, roasted meat and herb aromas. The structure is solid and somewhat gripping, presenting deep red-fruit flavors with dried herb accents, driven by balanced acidity."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Martinborough,Decibel,28.0,92.0,"Silky and plush, this medium- to full-bodied Pinot Noir features a delicate interplay of cinnamon and clove with cherry and pomegranate. It glides easily to a long finish, picking up a hint of bacon or wood smoke along the way. Drink now–2023."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Sattlerhof,28.0,92.0,"Juicy notes of grass and passion fruit make for a very forward, aromatic and intensely appetizing Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is taut, very dry and slender but chock-full of fragrant fruit. The finish is enlivening and resoundingly aromatic."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sextant,28.0,92.0,"A bucket of buttery popcorn gets treated to sharp, rosemary-like aroma on the nose of this intriguing and tasty wine. It's heaver on the palate than other wines of the same vintage, with flavors of butter-crusted apple pie. The deep finish lasts for minutes."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Arndorfer,28.0,92.0,This suggests freshly baked pear tart with baked Bramley apple and cushioned overtones of lemon-streaked pastry. Soft vanilla rings in the background but the twin pleasures of apple and pear take center stage. Earthiness provides grounding and more interest.
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Foundry Vineyards,28.0,92.0,"This is made from fruit that was sourced from the same vineyard and picked at the same brix level as Foundry's Stainless Chardonnay bottling. But here the toast of new oak adds a lovely flavor to the smooth butterscotch and apple notes. It opens gracefully and quickly, but the Stainless bottling has more grip and complexity."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Flywheel,28.0,92.0,"Crushed lilacs, raw beef, dried tobacco and leather combine with very earthy and rocky aromas of potting soil on the deeply layered nose of this bottling from a vineyard on the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The palate combines rusty earth, dried sagebrush and dill with blackberry jam and blueberry jelly, with a serious savory boost into the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Eberle,28.0,92.0,"Tarry, gamy aromas provide an intriguing entry into this bottling from pioneer Gary Eberle's winery, founded in 1982. The nose also conveys charred blueberries, thyme, rosemary and lavender. Leathery, rustic flavors show on the palate, alongside hints of boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and roasted venison."
Weissburgunder,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ebner-Ebenauer,28.0,92.0,"This slender but expressive Pinot Blanc is possessed of a wonderfully light touch. Right now, yeasty tones still swing alongside the bright stone fruit but this will soon come into its own and show off the slender but distinct and food friendly nature of Pinot Blanc. Revel in the subtle stony depth and elegance of this wine. Its long finish tells you everything."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,92.0,"Whiffs of lime and lemon zest, lanolin and herbs entice on the nose. Off dry in style, this is chock-full of sweet-tart melon and citrus flavors glazed in a slick of honey, which lingers on the finish"
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Lis Neris,28.0,92.0,"This polished, structured white opens with intense aromas of yellow peach, passion fruit, dried hay and crushed tomato vine. The linear, vibrant palate delivers juicy nectarine, creamy white peach and green melon. It's balanced, with refreshing acidity."
Primitivo,US,California,Monte Volpe,28.0,92.0,"Made in a structured, traditional and dry style, this wine will be great at dinnertime. It has moderate and attractive spice and oak aromas, full body and ripe fruit flavors that don't go to extremes. The sense of balance, layered texture, reserved flavors and sophistication make it a winner."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Leo Steen Wines,28.0,92.0,"Danish sommelier-turned-winemaker Leo Hansen aims to make food-friendly wines, and this delicate Chenin is a great example. Light honey, candied lemon, lime pith and tangerine peel aromas show subtly on the nose. Sparkly acidity makes its clean and crisp nectarine, cherimoya and lime skin flavors pop, with pinpoint focus and a slight grip."
Chardonnay,US,California,Balletto,28.0,92.0,"Apple skin, sea stone and lemon notes comprise the light-bodied narrative of this balanced, bright and complex wine. From a vintage known for its modest yields, this wine shows the quality of the producer's estate vineyards, which range across the appellation."
Syrah,US,California,Lafond,28.0,92.0,"Dried raspberries and leathery blackberry fruit get added character from violets on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling from winemaker Bruce McGuire. The palate shows lots of peppercorns and mint in its aromatic core, which is laid across tightly restrained blackberry fruit flavor."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Maurice Schoech & Fils,28.0,92.0,"The slightly more evolved nose that effortlessly fuses crushed chamomile leaf and lemon zest also hints at dark fir honey. It glides seamlessly into a fast-flowing, straight channel of acidity. There is movement and poise in this virtual journey into freshness and aroma. It is the lemon that lasts longest on the palate, which is dry and of exquisite purity."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Melville,28.0,92.0,"There's a very candied red-cherry quality to the nose of this wine from a vineyard that the winery will cease using with this vintage, along with sexy aromas of violet, lilac, clove, cola, peppercorn and rose. A sage-driven character emerges once sipped, giving spice to bright red, slightly sour cranberry fruit."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Red Car,28.0,92.0,"A deliciously light, bright wine that hits the mark year after year, this cool-climate offering is fresh in zingy acidity and juicy flavors of grapefruit, strawberry and lime. The acidity buoys the experience from first sip to last, backed by enough body to remain in balance. This wine is fermented like a white wine without skin or seed contact."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,28.0,92.0,"Dusty slate and spice tones intensify this brisk, grapefruit-laced Kabinett from the famed Josephshöfer site. Sweet-tart lemon and tangerine flavors are scintillating and brisk, enriched by a luscious mineral slick that lingers on the palate. Its sharp, linear style is attractive already but should meld gorgeously from 2021."
Syrah,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,28.0,92.0,"The estate Syrah immediately shows a toastier nose and richer fruit than the excellent Columbia Valley bottling. Along with cassis, black cherry and blackberry fruit are powerful layers of toasted nuts, butterscotch and coffee. At the moment the wine seems still to be holding something back; decanting and substantial breathing time are highly recommended."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Tulpen,28.0,92.0,"Pure Cabernet sourced from a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, and finished at 14.9% alcohol. Supple and spicy, this displays a firm core of tart fruit, annotated with lead pencil, graphite and charcoal. Though it seems almost deceptively light alongside the Tulpen Merlot, this compact and layered wine is built to age over a decade or more."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Portal,28.0,92.0,"This reserve wine is a ripe and smooth blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca. New wood aging for nine months has brought out the ripeness of the fruit and added a spicy edge. Still young, its black fruit and structure need further developing. Drink from 2019."
Merlot,US,Washington,Tulpen,28.0,92.0,"As with the 2008 Tulpen Cabernet, the Lewis (Yakima Valley) and Wallula (Horse Heaven Hills) Vineyards provided the fruit. A muscle Merlot, this is smooth and round, bearing flavors of mixed berry and ripe cherry, with added notes of iron and clean earth."
White Blend,South Africa,Swartland,Mullineux,28.0,92.0,"This Chenin Blanc-based blend, with 13% Clairette, 10% Viognier and 4% Sémillon, starts off with notes of fresh herbs and verbena, supported by notes of lightly toasted-apple skin, white peach and melon. There's a pleasant roundness to the body, though ample acidity and a lingering clove accent pick up the midpalate and carry through to the lingering finish. Drink now–2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Hubert Brochard,28.0,92.0,"“Today, as in the past,” reads the title of this wine. Rich and full, it was aged on the lees to give extra weight and body. The result is ripe with yellow fruits as well as citrus, with full-bodied flavor. It could well age until 2015."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Kevin White,28.0,92.0,"This wine is equal parts Grenache and Mourvèdre topped off with Syrah (8%). The aromas offer fascinating, focused notes of coffee, bacon fat, crushed gravel, spice and herbs. The blue-fruit flavors bring a sense of purity and delicacy, fleshing out over time."
Shiraz,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,28.0,92.0,"Inky violet in color, this wine has a bouquet of blueberry, vanilla and nutmeg. At first sip, coolness makes its presence known, but flavors of blueberry, cherry, white chocolate and orange rind ultimately dominate notes of eucalyptus. The cherry-chocolate finish is awash in velvety tannins."
Primitivo,US,California,Uphill Vineyards,28.0,92.0,"Floral aromas like rose and lilac give this lush and fruity wine a unique character. It has very ripe, exotic fruit flavors that resemble blueberries, macerated cherries and boysenberries. Subtle oak nuances form a lightly spicy background, while firm tannins add grip to complete a nicely balanced and high-intensity package."
Pinot Noir,US,California,La Honda Winery,28.0,92.0,"There are a lot of intriguing and unique aromas on the nose of this bottling, from candied pomegranate and wild blueberry to olive, rosewater, cinnamon and carnation. Those deep fruits and exotic spices show on the sip as well, where a tense acidity leads into a tart cherry finish."
Grenache,US,California,Miner,28.0,92.0,"Light in color and clear, this 100% varietal wine from a prime spot in Carneros known better for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay dances in the glass, a celebration of floral violet aromas and faint white pepper. Restrained and elegant, it's plenty spicy and fresh, finishing with just the right amount of red cherry."
Merlot,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,28.0,92.0,"This wine commands attention with its aromas of dark raspberries, milk chocolate and barrel spices. Flavors show plenty of richness and intensity with a supple texture that dazzles."
Rosé,US,California,Curran,28.0,92.0,"Though considered a rosé, Grenache Gris is actually its own grape, and a delicious one at that. Pale pink in color, this shows bubblegum, watermelon, rose petal, strawberry and cola spice on the nose. The palate is marked by boisterous, lemon-like acidity yet remains soft and welcoming, with sweet cotton candy touches."
Riesling,France,Alsace,La Cave des Vignerons de Pfaffenheim,28.0,92.0,A breezy zingy nose of lemon makes for a very refreshing proposition. The palate does not disappoint and continues in the same tart-but-ripe citrus fashion. The sharp freshness on the dry palate makes the citrus notes shine even more. This is utterly refreshing and totally moreish.
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,92.0,"Spine-tingling acidity cuts a fine edge through this buoyantly fruity but nuanced wine. The palate is lip-smackingly sweet-tart, bursting of ripe raspberry and yellow cherry flavors that stretch out a long, spicy finish. Drink now through 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,92.0,"Bold, penetrating yellow-cherry and pink grapefruit flavors are calibrated by streaks of lime, lemon and slate in this invigorating kabinett. Kicks of saffron and spice accentuate its pert, racy style. Enjoy now through 2018 for fresh, fruity refreshment."
Aglianico,US,California,Rosa d'Oro,28.0,92.0,"This big, bold, full-bodied wine has everything in spades: giant aromas of boysenberry, saturated jammy flavors, thick but fine-textured tannins, plenty of alcohol and an appealing viscosity that carries the flavors through a long finish. Best after 2019."
Aglianico,US,California,Monte Volpe,28.0,92.0,"This impressive and beautifully proportioned wine smells jammy and smoky. It tastes luxurious, exotic and concentrated as very ripe berry flavors meet black pepper, cardamom and dark chocolate. The texture is broad and lush, but also firm with fine tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Jade Moon,28.0,92.0,"Heavy duty purple aromas of blackberry chiffon and blueberry pudding are lifted by a strong dill element on this darkly layered bottling. Baked blueberries meet with black olives, more dill and cut oregano, held together by a strong tannic structure."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Lucien Lardy,28.0,92.0,Long barrel aging has given this wine an extra richness. That supplements the ripe red fruits and intense acidity. The result is a wine that is bright with a spice and floral character. The aftertaste brings out crispness and some minerality. Ready to drink now.
Malbec,US,California,Saracina,28.0,92.0,"Big and rich, this full-bodied wine has an aroma like the crema on an espresso and abundant dark-fruit flavors. A wonderful, mouthcoating texture keeps the flavors lingering on the finish. The sense of layering and creaminess that extends after a sip is captivating."
Chardonnay,US,California,Carpe Diem,28.0,92.0,"From the folks behind Roederer Estate, its premier producer of sparkling wine, is this gorgeous still Chardonnay, clean, complex and crisp with a heady perfume of luscious pear and honey. Decadent and yet restrained, the mouthfeel is mellow, a touch decadent, with just the suggestion of its time in barrel."
Tempranillo,US,California,Rexford,28.0,92.0,"Fresh-pressed strawberry, sugar beet, lavender and rose petal aromas show in this botting, which is a complex take on Tempranillo. Black plum and mulberry flavors are delicately presented, leading the intriguing and buoyant palate, which is light in body but full of elegant flavor."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,River's Edge,28.0,92.0,"The high alcohol may be a stumbling block for some palates, but this wine is nonetheless absolutely delicious. Sourced from a vineyard planted in 1972, it was aged in 50% new French oak. It's intense and detailed, with hints of wintergreen, a broad streak of cherry cola, and finishing licks of molasses, brown sugar and coffee."
Chardonnay,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,28.0,92.0,"Just a hint of pear peel rises from the nose. The palate is rich with glowing pear fruit, even a little warm, but utterly precise. All this is met with a vein of lemon freshness that brightens all the apples and pears. There is concentration and juiciness, concentration and purity. There is something very fluid and utterly moreish about this."
G-S-M,US,California,Peter Franus,28.0,92.0,"With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This one'll age, but is so convincingly reminiscent of the Northern Rhône right now, it'll be hard to wait."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,River's Edge,28.0,92.0,"The winery produces two old-vine Pinots from estate-grown fruit; this shows a touch more concentration and complexity. Black-cherry cola, smoke, earth, tobacco and even a faint whiff of the barnyard all mingle, leading the taster down an engaging flavor trail that winds gracefully into a lingering finish. Drink now through 2022."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,28.0,92.0,"While the wine has considerable power and richness, it is the fresh character that's most noticeable. The firm tannins and dark structure are shot through with black currant acidity and fresh berry fruits. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,28.0,92.0,"Whatever the Jackson family does in Santa Maria works quite well, including this wine. The wondrous nose shows chives, exotic pears, mandarin pith, sesame seeds, a touch of smoke and chalky grip. On the palate, flavors recall fried green apple peels, lemon juice, quince, star fruit and lemon pith."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Weingut Albert Gessinger,28.0,92.0,"While shades of slate and saffron lend complexity and nuance, this semisweet wine is more a showcase of sumptuous yellow peach and pear flavors. Its high-toned acidity and delicate, lacy mouthfeel make it irresistibly gulpable."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,27.0,92.0,"Lanolin and honeycomb notes lend a minerally feel to rich, lusciously concentrated peach and tangerine flavors in this powerful yet finely structured kabinett. A hint of spritz and shocking lemon-lime acidity lead the way to a long, elegant finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Prospect 772,27.0,92.0,"This imposing and extremely ripe tasting wine has an inky dark color, aromas of ripe black cherries, flavors of cassis, espresso and bitter chocolate and a very firm, tannic texture to support all that opulence. Made from half Petite Sirah and half Syrah, it's a no-holds-barred feast of fruit and power."
Red Blend,US,California,Oso Libre,27.0,92.0,"Translating to “The Boss's Red,” this blend of 50% Zinfandel and 50% Merlot is a bomber, with aromas of violet-laced fudge cake, ginger snaps, stewed black cherries, vanilla and sarsaparilla. The palate is all about purple flavors, with ginger-molasses spice as well as lifting spearmint and lilacs."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Gianni Brunelli,27.0,92.0,"This opens with an intense fragrance of perfumed berries, crushed blue flower, hints of Mediterranean herbs and a whiff of new leather. The ripe palate brings together juicy wild cherry layered with notes of baking spices alongside supple tannins and just enough freshness. Enjoy now–2017."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Agustí Torelló Mata,27.0,92.0,"Bready, yeasty apple and pear aromas come with grassy hints and notes of green herbs. As a brut nature, it's no surprise that this hits with straight-ahead acidity and crispness. Flavors of sourdough bread, lemon and golden apple finish stony, tight and minerally. Drink through 2019."
Shiraz-Grenache,Australia,South Australia,Glaetzer,27.0,92.0,"Roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Grenache, this is a full-bodied, lush example of Barossa Valley product. Hints of mint and cracked pepper add nuance to the ripe raspberry fruit, while spice and red-fruit nuances linger on the supple yet spine-tingling finish. Drink now–2020 for its youthful exuberance."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Vicentin,27.0,92.0,"Heady aromas of olive and balsamic blackberry come with touches of rubber and road tar in front of a dense, well-groomed palate that doesn't bite or overpower. Ripe blackberry, toast and baking spice flavors end with warmth and clarity. Drink through 2019."
Red Blend,Spain,Central Spain,Mano A Mano,27.0,92.0,"Intriguing aromas of boysenberry and blueberry come with smoky notes of hickory and aged cheese. This is showing a firm grip on the palate along with ripe, intense flavors of black fruits and prune. On the finish, it's tannic and loaded with licorice and toasty accents. Drink through 2019."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,27.0,92.0,"Totally creamy notions of rose and carnation create a seductive nose. The palate joins in with ample fruit and sweetness. The residual sugar is finely balanced with lemony freshness: a very traditional, if not to say old-fashioned Gewürztraminer, but totally charming and rather delicious. Finishes medium sweet."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Larose Perganson,27.0,92.0,This estate is under the same management as the neighboring large vineyard of Larose Trintaudon. The wine is stylish with ripe fruit that is balanced with fine acidity. It has structure from a core of tannins that are just beginning to soften. The wine will be ready to drink from 2020.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,27.0,92.0,"This is a powerful and concentrated wine. It is full of dusty, dark tannins that are still masking the rich blackberry and black currant fruits. There is a dry core here that will fill out as the wine matures. It's a serious, long-lasting wine that needs aging. Drink from 2018."
Traminer,Austria,Wachau,Eder,27.0,92.0,"An intriguing mix of pepper, rose petals, stone fruit and zesty lime creates a heady aroma. The palate is more toned down but all the more appealing for it. Rounded and concentrated, this is full of textural and aromatic interest. Ripe, washed-rind cheeses or spicy pan-Asian combinations would do this rich, layered wine real justice."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Mittelburgenland,Heinrich,27.0,92.0,"Only faint glimpses of ripe red plum with aromatic spice reminiscent of clove and cinnamon reveal themselves. With more air, the characteristic pepper appears, as does dark, ripe fruit. The palate is concentrated and structured but remains fresh and slender. This is elegant wine for an elegant occasion."
Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes,27.0,92.0,"Soft notes of Golden Delicious on the nose really unfold on the palate. The body is slender but the fruit notes have a honeyed quality, as befits a vintage Crémant. Its biscuity shortcrust flavours are accentuated by soft mousse and are a great counterpoint to the very refreshing, pleasantly light-weight body. The finish is creamy and full of yeasty roundness, yet beautifully dry."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Gloria Ferrer,27.0,92.0,"Earthy cherry and wild strawberry notes form the core of this deep, concentrated and yet not overly dense wine. Herbal and teasingly tart as it shifts from midpalate to finish, it offers a last splash of nutmeg on the finale."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Jäger,27.0,92.0,"Citrus peel, naked rock and cold mountain streams are the images conjured up by the first whiff of this fine, featherlight Riesling. Sprightly and fresh, wired and zesty, it is a reminder of the bracingly fresh and thrilling 2014 vintage. This will provide supreme refreshment on a hot day but also keep its cool in years ahead. Riesling ahoy!"
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bressia,27.0,92.0,"Early on this shows edgy, minty aromas of toasty oak, but then plum, wild berry, warm dust and malty notes settle in. Chunky, grapy weight makes for a full, broad palate, while baked berry and savory meat flavors end dark, potent and satisfying. Drink through 2030."
Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine Roche-Audran,27.0,92.0,"An oak-fermented blend of 90% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier, this is a full-bodied, richly textured wine for drinking over the near term. Nutty scents and flavors accent grilled peach and pineapple fruit, ending in a long, mouthwatering finish."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Forgeron,27.0,92.0,"Roughly half of the blend is made from fruit that comes from 30-year-old vines. An addition of 6% Muscat adds a scent of tree fruit, and the lovely citrus and stone fruit flavors are enhanced by a fresh-baked bread note. It has excellent concentration and impeccable balance, plus a long, satisfying finish."
Cabernet-Syrah,US,Washington,Efeste,27.0,92.0,"Deep purple, it explodes into lush fruit flavors of tangy boysenberry, blackberry, black cherry and cassis, with a smoky black licorice streak woven through. The tannin management is exceptional here––firm and substantial, without any bitter or green aspect. This is a supple, powerful and ageworthy wine with depth and muscle unusual in this price range."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,27.0,92.0,"This medium-sweet wine shows the weight of the clay soils in the vineyard. It's rich, full of spice with a touch of honey as well as lychee and pomegranate. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2016."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,27.0,92.0,"Softer hints of chamomile and ripe apple play on the nose. The palate has some of the balmier qualities of chamomile tisane and a lively, friendly apple freshness. Acidity and fruit ripeness are harmoniously aligned, while citric freshness highlights herbal and apple peel glints even more. This is slender but smooth, lively but mellow and delicious."
Chardonnay,US,California,Y Rousseau,27.0,92.0,"Intensely perfumed this dark golden vineyard-designate is young and still resolving, youthfully fresh and alive. Coconut, Brazil nut and Asian pear give it context and texture, with a background invitation of homemade biscuit."
Sylvaner,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,27.0,92.0,"Brilliant, crystalline freshness tinged with chervil and lemon is the impression on the nose. The palate is rounder than the nose suggests but has the same brilliance and lightness of flavor. Sylvaner is an underrrated grape that is all about subtlety and herbal nuance. This lovely, expressive but light-bodied example has it in spades. Lemony freshness resonates long."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Talbott,27.0,92.0,"This offers a great taste of an iconic vineyard for less than $30. Tart cranberry, bay leaf and sagebrush make for an expressive nose. The palate is laced with thyme, sage and more bay-leaf as well as nutmeg, which all sit atop dark red, almost-purple fruit, making for an intriguing combination."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Love & Squalor,27.0,92.0,"Ignore the silly name and focus on the important particulars—old vine (planted 1976), wild yeast, biodynamic farming. Absolutely bone-dry yet bursting with complex minerality, citrus rind, and penetrating acidity, it has phenolics that give length, breadth and detail."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,27.0,92.0,"A both heady and leafy swirl of passion fruit adds a tropical touch to the nose. The palate brims with sweetness and zesty passion fruit and grapefruit spice. The flavors are intense and the palate is medium sweet, aptly countered by lemon and passion fruit. This strikes a lovely balance and gives tons and tons of fruit and flavor."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Sidebar,27.0,92.0,"With an aroma like sweet vermouth and rich, chocolaty, smoky flavors, this Rhône-style blend exerts an exotic influence on the palate. The mouthfeel is smooth and graceful, with mild tannins, while the lingering finish echoes opulent fruit and spice notes. The winemaker used 48% Mourvèdre and lesser amounts of Grenache and Syrah."
Sparkling Blend,England,England,Ridgeview Estate,27.0,92.0,"This wine brims with fruit and freshness. A host of apple notions comes alive on nose and palate: The appetizing, ripe tartness of Cox Orange Pippin, the mouthwatering crispness of Granny Smith and the mellowness of Golden Delicous. It has a refreshing, open honesty, juicy and totally inviting. Underneath all that allure lies rich autolysis, underlined by a fine, creamy mousse. Flavors and freshness linger."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Stark-Condé,27.0,92.0,"This is a layered, earthy selection, with upfront aromas of leather and cigar box complemented by fruity tones of blackberry and cassis. The medium-weight palate is lush and velvety, and the tannins are fine yet firmly structured. Boysenberry preserves and black pepper linger on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Talley,27.0,92.0,"Daffodils, lemon rinds and yellow apples rise on the nose of this bottling like a delicate flower petal. The palate is also finely toned, light in style and easy to enjoy, with hints of limestone, sea salt, Meyer lemon and Gravenstein apple."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château de la Ragotiere,27.0,92.0,"Aged on its lees for 30 months and bottled in March 2015, this is an exceptional Muscadet. It still has plenty of freshness along with a tight, mineral texture and lightly smoky flavors. The concentration gives the wine richness while it remains bone dry and crisp. It is ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,California,Oso Libre,27.0,92.0,"Quite youthful for its advanced age, this bottling shows crushed herbs, ground coffee, dense blueberries, leathery smoked meats and tobacco on the nose. The palate conveys tangy boysenberries with black pepper and crushed herbs, laid across a smooth tannic structure."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,S.A. Prüm,27.0,92.0,"Penetrating strikes of honey, peach and chamomile charge through this light-footed yet powerful Kabinett. It's blossomy and perfumed from start to finish, lifted by a dazzling spray of lemon-lime acidity and lacy filigreed sweetness. A lovely wine to drink now, but will hold nicely, if not improve, until 2020."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Wise,27.0,92.0,"Featuring a voluptuous nose of stone fruit and citrus framed by roasted nuts and toasty oak, this is a rich, amply endowed Chardonnay with a big personality and bold flavors. Ripe peach notes join with citrus, hazelnuts and toast on the long finish. Drink now."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,27.0,92.0,"Wonderfully pure and mellow Red Delicious notes are displayed on the nose, promising pleasure. The palate has an even stronger impression of this vivid fruit as well as a superfine, tender and creamy mousse that counteracts the inherent freshness. This is dry and elegant and brimming with pure apple flavors. The finish is mouth-watering and utterly moreish with its clean long echo of red apple."
Cannonau,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Pala,27.0,92.0,"Structured but sleek, this has aromas of ripe blackberry, raspberry and ground cooking spice. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, black pepper, anise, wild herb and tobacco while ripe, polished tannins provide support. It nicely blends structure and elegance."
Chardonnay,US,California,Talley,27.0,92.0,"Buttered sourdough toast and a slight nuttiness kick off another excellent Chardonnay from the ever-reliable Talley. The palate is greeted with minerality that fades into an apple butter flavor alongside a pinch of cinnamon, culminating in a graceful vanilla finish."
Syrah,US,California,Kenwood,27.0,92.0,"A full, rounded wine, this vineyard designate exudes a richness of juicy black cherry with savory pepper and meat aromas. The robust tannic structure contributes additional girth and depth, accentuating the darker, more brooding elements of the whole."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Malat,27.0,92.0,"Hayflowers and savory lovage and arugula notes, inflected with piquant lime zest create an irresistibly spicy palate of such lightness and ease, there is a spring in the step of this light but intensely flavoured wine. If you want spicy refreshment, look no further."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,V. Sattui,27.0,92.0,"From a vineyard in Yountville, this wine has a voluptuous entry of baked peach and vanilla, with a back beat of tart key lime. Layered and lengthy, it offers flavor and body in abundance, ending fleshy and full."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,27.0,92.0,"Spicy pear and apple fruit is at the core, with suggestions of green pineapple, mint and lemon verbena. The subtle herbs and citrus components are layered throughout, and the structure favors long term cellaring."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,27.0,92.0,"Perfumed and so pretty, this lively kabinett abounds with aromas and flavors of sweet citrus, pineapple and mango. Lavish lavender and potpourri notes persist from nose to finish, lending elegance to this otherwise juicy fruity wine. The sweet-tart tangerine finish is long and meandering."
Port,Portugal,Port,Quinta do Noval,27.0,92.0,"Coming from the great 2011 vintage, this is an impressive wine. It is rich, smooth and generous in the mouth. Dark dried fruits and acidity create a wine that is on the dry side of Ports. The tannins and acidity and the fact the wine is unfiltered mean it could age although ready now. Drink until 2030."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Graci,27.0,92.0,"Spanish Broom, lemon blossom, pear, nectarine, candied citrus, Mediterranean herbs and intense mineral sensations are all woven together, lifted by bright acidity. Made with Carricante and Catarratto, this is already delicious now, but will develop complexity over the next few years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Gruber Röschitz,27.0,92.0,"It's that arresting mix of flintiness and savory yeast that gets you first. There are hints of pine and ivy, all bedded in the ripeness of juicy yellow pear and mirabelle plum. Whiffs of white pepper provide extra excitement and draw you in. This is clean and complex, rich and streamlined. Dive in."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes,27.0,92.0,"Lemon plays on the nose alongside hints of shortbread. The palate has a lovely rich creaminess and very fine elegant mousse, creating an impression of light-bodied richness. This is sophisticated and dry, elegant and creamy—very grown-up and utterly delicious."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Jean-Paul Brun,27.0,92.0,"A dense wine with the tannins and structure to go with the density. It is concentrated with great swathes of black plum and spice flavors, shot through with acidity. Made with wild yeast and without carbonic maceration, this is a wine for serious aging. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ponzi,27.0,92.0,"Stunningly good for an entry-level Pinot Noir, this new Tavola gets the sort of care generally reserved for reserves. Native yeast fermentation and almost a year in 20% new French oak is where it starts; then a barrel selection is made and it's bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deep flavors emphasize black fruits, with a dash of pepper highlighting the finish."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Lang & Reed,27.0,92.0,"Silky and voluptuous, this is a compelling example of the rare variety being able to shine in the Napa Valley when put in the right hands.

Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Uccelliera,27.0,92.0,"This juicy, savory Rosso opens with a pretty fragrance of crushed violets, perfumed berries and sweet cake spices. The ripe, delicious palate doles out concentrated wild cherry, black raspberry and cinnamon-spice alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Bright orange fruit sensations signal the close."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Lecco,27.0,92.0,"Direct and woody on the nose, with aromas of graphite and vanilla, this opens in fine form. A tight, pure palate deftly blends weight, fine acidity and chewy tannins, while the flavor profile is earthy and blackened by charred oak, with blackberry fruit and savory, peppery spice notes. This is meaty, savory and beefy on the finish. Drink through 2021."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Martin Ranch,27.0,92.0,"Aromas of blackberries are set against freshly milled cedar, dried flowers, chopped herbs and a bit of iron. Oregano and thyme lead the palate, with slightly sour boysenberry fruit as well as espresso, dark chocolate and camphor, leaning on herbs more than ripe fruit."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Jaffurs,27.0,92.0,"This is an exciting wine, simultaneously serious and fun, with a steely minerality and clean nectarine on the nose. The palate is energetic, showing both tight limestone and more deliciously hedonistic notes of Fuji apples and Japanese pear. The acidity kicks expertly throughout."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Muga,27.0,92.0,"Lightly charred aromas of plum and blackberry carry meaty, savory, leathery notes that crank up the complexity quotient. A round, balanced mouthfeel and generous flavors of baked plum, black cherry and savory spices finish ripe and deep, with hints of tobacco and raisin. Drink this exemplary reserva from a great vintage through 2025."
Chardonnay,US,California,Gundlach Bundschu,27.0,92.0,"Asian pear and Meyer lemon curd form a viscous, sensual core of balanced richness and acidity in this lovely wine, from a set of vineyard blocks planted partly to 40-plus-year-old heritage vines. A stony quality permeates throughout the fruit, combining for a sense of refreshing complexity."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Les Vignobles Gueissard,27.0,92.0,"This is a beautiful spice and mint-flavored wine. The wood aging has left a strongly perfumed character to the rich black fruits and acidity. Structured and firm, this will develop into a ripe intense wine. Drink from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,27.0,92.0,"The Pioneer Block series from Saint Clair remains a reference point for Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. This year, I had a slight preference for Block 3 from the low-lying Dillons Point subregion. It's grassy yet ripe, with flamboyant nectarine and gooseberry notes, plenty of weight and textural interest and a long, mouth coating finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Concannon,27.0,92.0,"This gorgeous, bold, almost thick-textured wine also brings finesse and a lingering finish. The aroma is smoky, toasty and earthy, then the desirably decadent flavors and creamy texture hit the mark, immediately filling the mouth with ripe pear, fig, toasted almond and grilled baguette impressions."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,27.0,92.0,"A rich hint of Golden Delicious apples appears first, followed by lively notes of ripe but fresh citrus and juicy Mirabelle plums. The palate has the same juiciness of fresh stone fruit, framed by lemon freshness but also slightness and elegance. This is light bodied, dry and very fresh, with a lovely edge of grapefruit-peel zestiness. The finish is whistle-clean and long."
Ugni Blanc,US,California,Paix Sur Terre,27.0,92.0,"One of the Central Coast's only bottlings of this grape, which is also known as Trebbiano, this is a great option for lovers of crisp and mineral-laden whites. Green plum, lemongrass and chalk show on the nose, which is reminiscent of a dewy spring morning, while the tightly wound palate combines kaffir lime, green fruit, salt and just a shred of jalapeño."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Alain Brumont,27.0,92.0,"A powerful, impressive wine. It combines dark, brooding tannins and firm fruits with such an elegant structure and texture. Solid and full of juicy black-plum flavors, it finishes with dry yet voluptuous tannins."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Trimbach,27.0,92.0,"A very shy nose just releases the most teasing hint of peach. The palate is utterly restrained: peach flavors are dry and brightened by lemon and have a wonderful lightness of touch. The finish is dry, clean and long. A very refreshing and clean-cut take on Gewurztraminer."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Chateau de l'Oiselinière,27.0,92.0,"Named after historic figures and philosophers, the wine is a serious take on Muscadet. With its ripe fruits, it is dense and textured. Spice and pepper show alongside the smooth fruit. This complex wine is now properly aged and ready to drink."
Riesling,Canada,British Columbia,Tantalus,27.0,92.0,"The vines, over 30 years old, deliver layered, racy, detailed flavors. German in style, the wine is loaded with citrus rind, honeysuckle, peach and lemon, finishing with minerals and a lick of honey. Intense and tightly structured for aging."
Xinomavro,Greece,Naoussa,Kir-Yianni,27.0,92.0,"Black cherry, currants and plums on the nose lead into a delicious balance of olive, plums and herbs on the palate. Dried currants, crushes stone and leather are also in the mix, with a chalky finish keeping the wine on track. Keep this one in the cellar or drink now with lamb or olive tapenade."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Felsner,27.0,92.0,"Hayflowers, summer meadows and ripe pears are conjured up by this wine. The palate is toned with a harmonious interplay of textural power and streamlined freshness. Grapefruit zestiness and herbal savoriness complete the tableau."
Port,US,California,Quady,27.0,92.0,"This fortified wine is made in a Port style by a California producer who has mastered the craft of fermenting Portuguese grape varieties over several decades. It is sweet and fortified, but also elegant, well balanced and not cloying. Nicely concentrated plum and chocolate flavors lead to a vivid, lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Pierre Morin,27.0,92.0,"This wine is from one of the top vineyard sites in the village of Bué. It is tense with the typical minerality of this vineyard, giving a wine that always needs to age. Its tight tangy orange-zest flavors are concentrated and reinforce the need to age the wine. Drink from 2019."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,27.0,92.0,"A surprisingly fresh wine, balancing acidity with powerful spiciness. It's ripe and full in the mouth, as spice and honey cut with a more bitter edge of quince jelly and lime acidity. Age this fine wine for at least five years."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Val d'Arenc,27.0,92.0,The high proportion of Mourvèdre (80%) in this Sénéclauze family wine gives it great richness and a fine perfumed character. It is has ripe apricot and pineapple fruits along with a strong pepper character. The mineral texture and fine acidity make this a great food wine.
Garnacha,Spain,Northern Spain,Alto Moncayo,27.0,92.0,"This full-bodied, ripe wine  offers blackberry and spiced plum aromas on top of a minerally base. In the mouth, it's big but fresh and free-flowing. Flavors of black plum and black cherry are lively despite some creamy oak that rises on the finish. Drink through 2016."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Gaudou,26.0,92.0,"A powerful, wood-aged wine, this shows weighty black fruit and a toasty character. It is concentrated and solid, yet it has a soft and rich side as well.  The tarry, tannic character needs at least four years to soften."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Casa Santos Lima,26.0,92.0,"One of the top wines from this producer, this blend of at least 10 grape varieties comes from its estate. The wood aging has added sophistication to this already concentrated wine. With black fruits to the fore and firm tannins, it will age well. Drink from 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Koyle,26.0,92.0,"Spicy aromas of balsam wood, tobacco and sawmill work well with ripe but reserved red-berry scents. Tight, tannic but also fresh as opposed to drying, this Cabernet from a cool year delivers a classic set of herbal berry, plum and wood spice flavors. A ripped finish is dry and oaky now, with core fruit resting for the future. Drink 2018–2028."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Philipp Kuhn,26.0,92.0,"This voluptuously textured wine balances a dry, elegant palate with plush peach and preserved quince flavors. Silken and supple, it clings lovingly on the palate, but finishes bold with a steely, mineral touch."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Raventós I Blanc,26.0,92.0,"This has a pretty light color, with dry raspberry and citrus scents. The palate is pure and elegant, with tangerine, grapefruit and nectarine flavors. This finishes longer than most, with poise and grace."
Zinfandel,US,California,Dashe Cellars,26.0,92.0,"A blend of five vineyards, some of which go into single-vineyard designates, this is a well made, structured wine, offering layers of black cherry and subtle earth around soft, velvety tannins. The finish highlights black pepper spice with dark chocolate chaser."
Chardonnay,US,California,Dunning Vineyards,26.0,92.0,"One of the many vintners proud of their forthcoming Willow Creek District appellation, Bob and Jo-Ann Dunning's Chardonnay presents delicate aromas of yellow flowers, vanilla bean, peach skin and limestone. The white rocks extend to the palate, picking up nectarine elements, too, creating a lean but flavorful wine that's refreshing enough to sip all night."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Paolo Scavino,26.0,92.0,"This elegant Nebbiolo delivers the grape's classic sensations of crushed raspberry, dark cherry, violet, sweet cake spices and a hint of orange peel. It's juicy and fresh with supple tannins. While this can age for a couple more years, enjoy it now for maximum freshness."
Grenache,US,California,Storrs,26.0,92.0,"From a vineyard in the hills overlooking the Santa Clara Valley, this bottling shows baked strawberry, cinnamon cream, Red Hots and black-plum juice, proving quite pretty if a tad candied on the nose. A light cinnamon-clove meringue flavor proves very inviting on the palate, where lush black cherry is leveled by a tart plum-skin grip."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Paul O'Brien,26.0,92.0,"Bone dry indeed, and searingly tart as well, this is loaded with complex, deeply inscribed flavors of fruit, stone and rind. Citrus is the highlight—a compelling mix of lime, grapefruit and orange peel. The finish is world class. Drink now through 2025."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,26.0,92.0,"Appealing aromas of cocoa, vanilla and spice intermingle with dark fruit. The palate brings plenty of the same, with pleasing richness and texture to the flavors, and lots of hang time on the finish."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Felsina,26.0,92.0,"Dark berry, underbrush and tobacco aromas lead the nose of this vibrant, structured wine while the palate doles out black cherry, fresh raspberry, licorice and clove. Fresh acidity and supple tannins balance the juicy flavors. Drink through 2018."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Leyre-Loup,26.0,92.0,"This beautifully perfumed wine is ripe, structured and well on the way to being delicious. Tannins and spice flavors have melded into rich black-cherry fruits cut with acidity. The wine could age for another few months, so drink from 2018."
Syrah,US,California,Bonny Doon,26.0,92.0,"This blend of grapes from four vineyards—48% Alamo Creek, 18% Bien Nacido, 18% Spanish Springs and 16% Ventana—offers dense berries and smoke on the nose as well as black pepper and tar. The tar shows strongly on the palate, as do blackberry blossoms and denser black pepper spice."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Dr. Nägler,26.0,92.0,"Fresh white peach and orange blossom aromas waft from start to finish on this richly concentrated wine. The palate is packed with unctuous peach and apricot flavors, but a streak of lime acidity and zesty citrus pith jolts the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Casa Santos Lima,26.0,92.0,"Structured, this oozes blackberry fruitiness as well as a balanced layer of dry tannins. The wine is fruity and rich while keeping its elegance. A core of tannins and fresh acidity in the fruit promise that this wine will age. Drink from 2017."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,26.0,92.0,"This is a rich and luscious wine dominated by Petit Manseng, a small berry/small-yield grape from Gascony, the home of unusual grapes. It's aromatic, ripe and honeyed with ripe peach cut by the pineapple freshness. It's a gorgeous wine now but it really should be aged so drink from 2020."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Animale,26.0,92.0,"A first for Animale, and a terrific success, despite the almost 16% alcohol. Bursting with ripe berry flavors, this complex and flat-out delicious wine goes well beyond its highly-extracted black fruit. Wet rock, chalk and mineral extend and enhance the finish, with a chocolaty kiss at the very end."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Trio Vintners,26.0,92.0,"Can Washington Mourvèdre really be this good? From the Far Away Vineyard (previously named for owner Art den Hoed) it sure can. Sappy and fresh, this lively wine features ripe red fruits, sharp acids and smooth tannins, with toasted walnuts and caramel streaking through the finish. It shows excellent concentration and length."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Buttonwood,26.0,92.0,"Tons of spice notes entertain the nose on this bottling, from white pepper and dill to sandalwood and incense, all against a cranberry-fruit backdrop. The palate, framed by an impressive though not oppressive structure, shows a touch of pasilla chile and black pepper before riper boysenberry and cranberry arise in the midpalate. Rose petals, pencil lead, thyme and oregano add nuance."
Moscatel,Spain,Andalucia,Jorge Ordóñez & Co.,26.0,92.0,"This opens with pure, attractive nectarine and apricot aromas, along with hints of mineral and petrol. It feels pure and racy, with delicious, clean flavors of pineapple, honey and mango. It's delicate and fresh on the finish, with just enough weight to be taken seriously."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,26.0,92.0,"Zesty lime cuts razor-sharp edges into this buoyant, fruity Riesling full of white peach, apple and honeysuckle notes. Delicately honeyed, it's piercing yet lip-smackingly juicy, finishing on a lingering spray of green florals. It's an elegant, tightly structured wine that's stunning now but will hold nicely through 2020."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weixelbaum,26.0,92.0,"Just-ripe green pears and scented spring flowers make this a charming proposition. Underneath, a firm and concentrated body unfolds into a refreshing and long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Roger et Didier Raimbault,26.0,92.0,"Aromas of currants and tropical fruits are followed by ripe nectarine and star fruit flavors with the acidity coming from a fresh pineapple character. It's an intense wine, with delicious, full concentration of flavors."
Champagne Blend,France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre,26.0,92.0,"Egarade means a “mysterious evening stroll,” according to the producer. Perhaps the idea is that you lose track of time in this wine. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it is rich and full-bodied with a good weight of white and green fruits and a final nervy texture and acidity."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Earthquake,26.0,92.0,"Not for everyone, this is the kind of Petite Sirah Quentin Tarantino would make if he made wine—big, in your face and ultimately a fine, bold wine full of intense black olive tapenade, chocolate and tobacco, with a tannic, peppery finish, a nod to its 22 months spent in French oak. Juicy and meaty and able to age another 5–7 years. Have some braised meat at the ready."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Cloudlift Cellars,26.0,92.0,"This standout blend—the best from this winery to date—is 68% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. It offers a complex assortment of cocoa, pencil lead, tomato leaf, mocha, cherry and herb aromas. The café au lait flavors are silky soft and concentrated, framed by bright acidity and showing an exquisite sense of balance and texture that carries through the lingering finish."
Malvasia Bianca,US,California,Palmina,26.0,92.0,"Extremely pungent yet not overdone aromas of ruby red grapefruit, tropical flowers and passion-fruit juice show on this great interpretation of the often sweet-leaning grape. Despite the showy nose, it's quite tight and dry on the palate, with flavors of pear and apple skins, lime rinds and yellow grapefruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,26.0,92.0,"Menzies is the name of Yalumba's Coonawarra estate, which is almost entirely devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon. Like most of the Yalumba wines, the oak levels have been pared back in recent vintages, allowing this wine's cassis fruit to to shine. Hints of tobacco, bay leaf and sage bring complexity, while the tannins are fine, adding a softly dusty feel to the long finish."
Champagne Blend,France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre,26.0,92.0,"With some maturity, this is a rich, full-bodied wine. Its crisp fruitiness has been tempered with a more toasty, yeasty character that adds complexity. The wine has good depth, with spice and a steely minerality coming together with the fruit. Drink now."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Italy Other,Murgo,26.0,92.0,"Fresh and refined, this has aromas of small red berry, yellow wild flower, tangerine and baking spice. The creamy, quenching palate doles out strawberry, red cherry and orange zest framed in crisp acidity and a lively, elegant perlage."
Chardonnay,US,California,Riverbench,26.0,92.0,"This bottling slips in many corners of the flavor experience at once. On the nose, a bit of tropical fruit mixes with evenly spread buttercream, followed by precursor hints of bright acidity on the palate. That citrus-led vibrancy does come, as does a mix of creaminess and limestone-inflected tang, as if the rocks themselves delivered the acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Berthiers,26.0,92.0,"Domaine des Berthiers produces rich Sauvignon Blanc, packed with spice, acidity, concentrated citrus and herbal flavors. This 2014, still very young, has a strong bite of acidity and tight mineral texture that gives an almost shocking crispness at this stage. The wine obviously needs to age; drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Norton,26.0,92.0,"This Bordeaux-style blend screams out friendly, from its warm, earthy bouquet of marzipan, earth and black fruits to its flush, layered palate to flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and fig. Finishing notes of licorice, spice and chocolate are plump and generous. Drink through 2019."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Paul Beaudet,26.0,92.0,"From two different domaines on the Côte de Py slope, this is a dense, firm wine, very solid and powerful. The wine has opulence under its structure, with rich plum and sweet jelly flavors. Worth aging for another year."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,26.0,92.0,"Very young, very closed up, but it's possible to tell that this will be an immense wine, even from the 2004 vintage. The acids, the dense structure, the hints of wood and the power of this wine are already in place. Soon, the fruit will come bursting in."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Paul O'Brien,26.0,92.0,"The winery has stuck with a deeply austere, penetrating and rather Germanic style of dry Riesling—which is difficult to do this well. Though built for acid freaks, it's also layered with complex flavors, blending citrus pith and rind, wet stone, green apple and green pineapple. It's drinking well already, and likely to hold steady for up to a decade."
Chardonnay,US,California,La Honda Winery,26.0,92.0,"Key-lime rinds, pink grapefruit, crisp pluot, just-ripe pineapple, nectarine and a steely gunmetal aroma show on the nose of this bottling. There's an intriguing touch of sweet onion to the sip. The laser-sharp precision would pair well with shellfish, but a slightly buttered warmth makes the bottling quite versatile."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Presqu'ile,26.0,92.0,"This bottling from an extremely cool-climate vineyard is light and easy on the nose, with ripe apples, sharp herbs, moss and an inherent grassy character deep within. It's extremely lively on the palate, with compellingly delivered acidity and a lime-skin tension carrying flavors of dried dill and sharp lemony citrus. It's one of the better Sauv Blancs of the vintage."
Rosé,US,California,Donkey & Goat,26.0,92.0,"Akin to a fresh basket of strawberries picked up at the farmer's market, this Grenache Rosé is intensely floral and fruity. A touch of blood orange peeks through, along with a flirty herbal streak and dry, soft textures. Light and bright, it offers a slight effervescence."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,González Byass,26.0,92.0,"Smoky campfire aromas come with notes of maple and molasses. This friendly, well-balanced Cream tastes of chocolate, figs and dates. The finish also tastes chocolaty, while vanilla and caramel notes make it all the more lovable."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,St. Innocent,26.0,92.0,"A slightly high-toned scent of lemon candy, pineapple and peach opens the door to this delicious Dijon clone Chardonnay. Aged 11 months in neutral French oak, it's lively and concentrated, with a finishing lick of butterscotch."
Red Blend,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,Lagar de Bezana,26.0,92.0,"Aromas of shaved balsam wood, aged cheese and spice accent berry tones on a nose that's far from blowsy. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Carmenère is ripe, rich and a touch soft. Heady, toasted dark-fruit flavors of blackberry and plum finish spicy and ripe. Drink through 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Casa Santos Lima,26.0,92.0,"Full of tannins at this stage, it shows power and density. It's a blend of more than 10 varieties, giving complexity as well as structure. There is acidity as well, bringing together the rich texture and a solid, wood and dark fruit combination. It needs to age a few years, so drink from 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Fontes da Cunha,26.0,92.0,"With a firm, almost granite structure, this is a terroir-driven wine, from a quinta named after the River Mondego that flows through the Dão region. It has a dense, tannic character based on ripe berry fruits and concentrated juicy black currants. The wine is intense and still needing to age. Drink from 2018."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,V. Sattui,26.0,92.0,"The smell of roses is vivid and pure, and the flavor of nectarines is strong in this attention-grabbing, full-bodied and lavishly textured wine. Just as remarkable as the floral character, the rich texture clings to the mouth after each sip."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château des Bormettes,26.0,92.0,"This is a rich wine, packed with red-berry fruits. Despite its density and ripe fruits, it has a fine streak of acidity that keeps it lively and crisp. It comes from vines close to the Mediterranean, resulting in a slightly salty character as well as the warm feel to this food-friendly wine. Drink from late 2017."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château de Gayon,26.0,92.0,"As it ages, this wine's color becomes deeper and more golden. The palate has lost its early acidity and gained richer tropical fruit, honey and layers of botrytis. It will always have a light touch with a crisp texture that underlies the riper fruits and sweetness. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Woodward Canyon,26.0,92.0,"The alcohol has dropped almost a full percentage point in 2011, but the wine has plenty of ripe, round fruit, with the emphasis on Meyer lemon, orange blossom, and pineapple. Forward and fruity, with mouth-filling sappiness, this is a wine to enjoy in the splendor of its youth."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,Valley View,26.0,92.0,"This thick, toasty dessert wine spent more than two years in new French oak. It works. Buttery and rich, it gains significant concentration after blowing past some volatile aromas. Toasted nuts abound, and the silky finish lingers."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château du Cèdre,26.0,92.0,"Although there is a little Merlot and Tannat in the wine, it is 90% Malbec. Still firmly tannic, it is concentrated and spicy. It has a dark dry texture that is lifted by ripe blackberry fruit. With acidity cutting right through, the wine is nowhere near ready to drink. Wait until 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,26.0,92.0,"Sunny yet spry, this invigorating Kabinett offers a crush of ripe tangerine, quince and yellow cherry flavors. Pert acidity cuts through all the fruity richness, extending a lean, sumptuously sweet finish. It's delightful already, but should develop well through 2025."
Syrah,US,California,La Clarine Farm,26.0,92.0,"This has a very deep, dark color that goes almost to the rim. It smells like blackberries and black pepper, tastes exotic and almost full-bodied but stays quite dry. It gives the sense of being well-stuffed with flavor but keeps a rather lean, lighter texture. Firm tannins give it structure and suggest drinking now through 2019."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Elena Walch,26.0,92.0,Delicate aromas of ripe orchard fruit and crushed stone lift out of the glass while the fresh rounded palate delivers mature apple and citrus. Crisp acidity lends balance while a savory mineral note closes the finish.
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de Fondrèche,26.0,92.0,"Nadal is approximately 50% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre. Like the 2009 Persia, it's a dark, intensely concentrated wine that's tight and ungiving but opens up to reveal notes of asphalt, earth, plum and espresso. It's full bodied and richly tannic, with a long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Paul O'Brien,26.0,92.0,"Here is a lovely, dry evocation of the spicy, fragrant grape, with a vibrant mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruit flavors. The floral aromatics are inviting and varietally appropriate, without becoming so perfumed that it makes food pairing a challenge."
White Blend,US,California,Skinner,26.0,92.0,"White pepper and vanilla bean aromas give this richly textured, concentrated and subtly fruity wine a spicy start. It has a bright yellow-gold color and has gained complexity through extended aging before release. Savory consomée and dried herb characteristics accent its substantial core of apple butter flavor."
Port,Portugal,Port,Ferreira,26.0,92.0,"The wine is dry, concentrated, very much in the house style of this legendary brand. It has acidity as well as the rich dried fruits, with the tannins a force in the background. It is a style of LBV that could age well, with its structure and acidity. Drink now, certainly, but it will be an even better wine from 2020 or 2022."
White Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Umathum,26.0,92.0,"Yeasty notes mingle among the rose petal scents of this red and green Traminer blend. With a little air, notions of orange peel appear and display the textured, structured but pliably soft core of this appetizing and unusual wine. Lemony freshness provides poise for the toned aromatics. The more you linger, the more facets you discover, including the long finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Richard Rottiers,26.0,92.0,"Old vines give a solid structure for this firm wine that is concentrated and dense. With wood aging and rich berry fruits, it's a complex wine with a good future. The black currant and berry fruits have a fresh character as well as great acidity. Drink from 2017."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Deaver,26.0,92.0,"This is an extreme example of an extreme varietal. The color is black except for a thin purple rim. The aromas are like dark chocolate and subdued blueberry. Flavors convey a deep profusion of blackberry and boysenberry with hints of sweet oak. Very full-bodied, full-flavored and mouthfilling, it delivers power with polish."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,26.0,92.0,"Ripe apple fruit is tempered by citrus freshness tinged with herbal spice suggesting sage and fennel seed. In the end, citric purity wins and carries this streamlined, concentrated wine into a long, spicy finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Calera,26.0,92.0,"Savory, earthy aromas of mushrooms, black pepper, iron and cranberry arise from this blend of nine vineyards, many of which are usually featured in single-vineyard selections. Umami rules the palate, and it's quite full for a lighter-colored wine, with brown spice, light red fruit flavors and expertly balanced acidity."
Grenache,US,California,Consilience,26.0,92.0,"Feral aromas of blood, gristle and game provide an intriguingly sexy quality to this wine. It proves quite light on the palate, with waves of umami crashing in, from truffles and mushrooms to dry-aged beef, with hints of crushed herbs and lavender adding complexity."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Earthquake,26.0,92.0,"A lavish oak component works well in this dark, intense wine to enhance the concentrated blackberry and black cherry flavors. Full-bodied and richly tannic in texture, the wine is very showy and delicious."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,26.0,92.0,"Both amplitude and generosity are apparent from the first sniff with ripe pear dominating the flavor spectrum. The body is concentrated and balances the full fruit with pleasant tingling zestiness. This is dry and precisely drawn, with a zesty finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,26.0,92.0,"Grapefruit and quince make for an exciting opening amidst some yeasty notes. On the palate, aromatic quince and plum notes reflect the generosity of the vintage while remaining dry and light-bodied. There is an ease here, of drinking and thinking, of sipping and being refreshed. This goes down far too easily on deceptively light feet. The finish is of refreshing lemon zest."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,26.0,92.0,"This well-made wine, blended with small percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Merlot, is an astounding value. Currant and cranberry notes and an underbelly of tannins play together in a smooth texture of rich concentration."
Gros Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château de Gayon,26.0,92.0,"This is a golden, mature and sweet wine that comes from the white wine appellation of the Madiran region. It balances ripe apricot and honey with intense acidity to create a beautiful wine. The zesty marmalade and final crispness are delicious. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Tulpen,26.0,92.0,"This Bordeaux blend is three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, yet deftly weaves in smaller percentages of Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Fruit-driven and complex, it's a smooth ride through fresh fruit flavors of plum, blueberry and cherry, focusing into a finish with ripe, polished tannins."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,26.0,92.0,"Crisp and delicious, this elegant wine delivers aromas and flavors of green apple, crushed stone, ripe pear and a hint of pastry cream. Bright acidity lifts the creamy flavors while a tangerine note gives it a clean mouthwatering finish."
Viognier,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,26.0,92.0,"This is an exceptionally well-crafted version of the variety from a tremendous site for the grape. Whole-cluster pressed and fermented in stainless steel, it retains fresh acidity that gives it lively tension on the palate, a foundation for briny lemon zest and classic floral notes."
Grenache,US,California,Minassian-Young,26.0,92.0,"This dry-farmed, small-batch wine offers dark purple-fruit aromas alongside spicy spearmint notes and a bit of unique nuttiness. It's fleshy, with ollallieberries and plum-skin flavors on the palate and a fresh fennel herbalness giving licorice grip on the close."
Greco,Italy,Southern Italy,Benito Ferrara,26.0,92.0,"Fragrances recall white flowers, stone fruit, Barlett pear, flint and lemon pie. The rich palate delivers layers of white and yellow peach, mineral, ginger, white pepper and pink grapefruit. The creamy texture is brightened by crisp acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Caves Aliança,26.0,92.0,"This single-estate wine is rich and opulent. Dark tannins and generous black fruits enhance this juicy wood-aged wine. A touch of mint gives a highlight to the polished feel. It needs aging, so drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Alorna,26.0,92.0,"Named after the fourth Marquesa who was a noted poet, this dense and concentrated wine is all about power and intensity. It has dark tannins, bold black fruits and super-rich wood-aged flavors. It is made to age further, and will be better from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,St. Innocent,26.0,92.0,"Dijon-clone Chardonnays from Oregon are distinctive and appealing, with excellent acidity behind fruit that stays on the lean side of tropical. Here are lightly buttery flavors of apple and peach pie, with a spicy kick to the finish."
Sauvignon,France,Loire Valley,Patrice Moreux,26.0,92.0,"From one of the top vineyard sectors of Pouilly-Fumé, the wine is rich, full and complex. Spice and vanilla are contrasted with the intense acidity and steely white-fruit and citrus flavors. It is still young with its fruitiness bursting out of the glass. Wait until 2018."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Cristom,26.0,92.0,"Lovely, lemony jasmine-tea scents and flavors abound in this delicate yet penetrating wine. Clean and fresh, it adds highlights of citrus rind without a trace of bitterness. Pure elegance."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Valdemar,26.0,92.0,"Open-grained oak aromas lend molasses and vanilla to the nose of this well-built Rioja. It's lively and choppy on the palate, with roasted plum and berry flavors, finishing dark and toasty with oak and graphite notes. Drink through 2026."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Fulcrum,26.0,92.0,"This medium-bodied full-flavored wine is a great example of the dry-style wines from Anderson Valley. It starts with a rose-like perfume, then floods the palate with Anjou pear and white peach. It feels rich and creamy, but also has good acidity and a tasty lingering finish."
Moscatel,Spain,Andalucia,Jorge Ordóñez & Co.,26.0,92.0,"A bright bouquet of floral extract and fine bath oil lays down the carpet for a well-balanced, highly expressive set of white-flower, lychee, lime and honeyed flavors. A full layered finish flows nicely. This is fine Spanish Moscatel."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Boeger,26.0,92.0,"Lively, spicy and warm, this full-bodied wine wraps firm tannins around flavors like mulled berries and preserved cherries, though it's also surprisingly fresh and vibrant. After baking spices, mellow fruit comes through on the palate, while the firm texture really keeps it going on the finish."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Teso La Monja,26.0,92.0,"Black in color and concentrated on the nose, this Tinta de Toro overflows with cassis and blackberry aromas. The palate is lively and lifted, with plenty of acidity and kick. Flavors of cassis and dark berries are charged up and toasty, while chocolate notes, firm tannins and a gritty edge define the finish. Drink through 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Chandler Reach,26.0,92.0,"Holding 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, this wine offers brooding aromas of fresh herbs, cherry, mocha and vanilla. The palate displays pleasing density and weight to the cranberry and cherry flavors that are accented by bright, zippy acidity."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Les Belles Collines,25.0,92.0,"Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication. Dry and light-bodied, it offers an edginess of slate-like minerality along with aromas of apricot and peach, finishing in a dusting of white pepper."
Red Blend,France,Provence,Château Paradis,25.0,92.0,"Firm and tannic in structure, this is a wine for aging. Ripe, dark fruits add power and a density of texture. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,WillaKenzie Estate,25.0,92.0,"This thoroughly delightful wine puts a polished sheen on this grape, that is so often lost in the shuffle between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay. Here the clean and fresh flavors of grapefruit, white peach and melon mingle gracefully, with palate-pleasing texture and zippy acidity."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Ovum,25.0,92.0,"From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment. It's smooth and supple—a pretty wine with honeyed minerality around fruit flavors of citrus and peaches."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Glatzer,25.0,92.0,"Rubin is the name used in Carnuntum for those wines that have been judged by other producers in the region. Walter Glatzer's Rubin is solid, dark, concentrated and rich. It has the smoothness of wood aging while retaining its Bing-cherry and black-currant flavors. With its firm character, it needs some aging for four years and more."
Syrah,US,California,Lynch Wines,25.0,92.0,"Concentrated, well structured and not too full bodied, this is an almost architectural wine in how it fills out the palate and clings to the taste buds. It has an appetizing texture due to fine-grained tannins, a sense of ripeness without overripeness, plus deep and layered fruit, coffee and black-pepper nuances."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Trenel Fils,25.0,92.0,"Named after the medieval rulers of the village, this cru wine is firm and structured in the solid style of the appellation. It has rich black cherry and black-plum fruits that come with juicy acidity. At the same time, the tannins and the dry core promise considerable aging. Drink from 2019."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine des Chers,25.0,92.0,"The northernmost of the Beaujolais cru villages can produce wines that are Burgundian in their structure. This wine fits that profile well with its dark tannins and rich concentration. Densely textured with both black-cherry fruit and a dry core, the wine is taking its time to develop. Drink from late 2017 or 2018."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Valderiz,25.0,92.0,"Crusty black-fruit aromas are minerally and charred, with blackberry and earthy notes lurking below deck. This is a tannic, wall-to-wall RDD that's pumping baked flavors of blackberry, chocolate, herbs and peppercorn. The finish is deep but not fierce. Drink this powerful wine through 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,C. von Nell-Breuning,25.0,92.0,"At almost 16 years old, this auslese exhibits the delicate transition Riesling makes from fruit to earth. Smoke, dusty minerals, saffron and caramel dominate the palate. Texturally, it seems layered with silk and astringency. On the finish, racy acidity lifts and revitalizes."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,US,Washington,Insania,25.0,92.0,"This Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is firm, powerful and polished. The fruit runs the gamut from citrus to melon to white peach, finishing with some youthful bite. Already a succulent, mouthfilling gem, but should improve for another five years."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Lucien Lardy,25.0,92.0,"Firm, concentrated and dense, this is a solid wine with a good future. Rich black fruits, red cherries and expressive acidity are all coming together alongside the dry core of tannins. Age this fine wine and drink from 2017."
Riesling,Canada,Ontario,Cave Spring,25.0,92.0,"Produced from the estate vineyard's oldest vines, this CSV bottling is a dry, leesy, textural wine, with dominant flavors of citrus flesh and rind along with green apples. There's a strong streak of mineral also, and a well-balanced finish of medium length."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,25.0,92.0,"This is an initially smooth wood-aged wine that is intense, concentrated and packed with power and tannins. It is rich and full of brooding dark plum and dense with structure. Dominated by Touriga Nacional, it has that variety's perfumed character which is balanced by the smoother Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz. It is obviously a wine to age, so drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Mouchão,25.0,92.0,"This is a big, ripe and fruity wine. It is now maturing well into a rich, solid, complex wine. This second wine from the Mouchão estate in Alentejo is gorgeous, opulent and rich. The black fruit character is powerful, with delicious acidity and a darkly tannic character. It is still very young, so drink from 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rosenblum,25.0,92.0,"Luscious and sleek in mouthfeel, and drenched with wonderful fruit flavors, this wine is a beauty. It has ample ripe fruit flavors like boysenberry and cherry pie without being literally sweet, while a sense of quiet concentration lasts on the lingering finish. It is structured with enough fine-grained tannin to age gracefully, so it's best to drink after 2019."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,25.0,92.0,Generously ripe notions of yellow plum and juicy pear fill the nose. The palate benefits from the same fruitfulness but adds a touch of pepper and herbal savor at its concentrated core. There is something joyful about this. Despite the generous fruit this stays streamlined and supercrisp. The finish focuses on that wonderfully spicy pepperiness.
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Chignard,25.0,92.0,"There's an explosion of rich, intense fruit here: dried prunes, black plums and even some licorice. The wine is attractively edged with wood, giving a fine, ripe finish."
Carignan,Chile,Loncomilla Valley,Morandé,25.0,92.0,"This Maule Valley old-vines Carignan opens with licorice, blackberry and cassis aromas along with exotic spice notes. It's big, tannic and firm as a boulder, with baked flavors of black fruits blended with coffee and toast. Licorice, blackened toast and overall grit take this to a good but gripping conclusion. Drink through 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Windstream,25.0,92.0,"On the nose, layers range from fragrant and floral jasmine to mango sorbet, and ripe nectarine to oven-fresh croissants. The mouthfeel is creamy, with stone fruit and banana flavors. Zingy acidity powers a long finish."
Malbec,US,Washington,Baer,25.0,92.0,"The variety announces itself with aromas of dark plum, fig, herbs and blackberry bud that enchant the senses. The fruit flavors are soft and plush, showing a dazzling sense of purity along with a finish that lingers. It flat out impresses."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Cáceres,25.0,92.0,"Riojas of this quality and price are not a dime a dozen. This ripe, delicious wine shows all the virtues of a great vintage. Earthy, roasted berry aromas are pure, ripe and magnetic. This feels full, tannic and strapping, while flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate are supported by generous but appropriate oak. Mocha, espresso and black-fruit residuals grace a fine finish. Drink through 2022."
Malbec,Argentina,Other,Michel Torino,25.0,92.0,"After years of tasting Don David Malbecs, here's one that rises above the rest. This is jammy and stacked with brawny black-fruit aromas. The mouth is bulky and bullish, but balanced, with blackberry flavors that are coated with copious oak and end in a tornado of coffee, mocha, mint and oak. Drink now–2016."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Losi Querciavalle,25.0,92.0,"Ripe black-skinned berry, truffle, scorched soil, violet and a potpourri of kitchen spice are some of the aromas that emerge on this polished red. The smooth, delicious palate doles out juicy black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and chopped mint set in a framework of silky, supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Edmeades,25.0,92.0,"Head-trained, century-old vines, provide intense scents with old vine herbal, herbaceous accents. Watermelon, hay and strawberries, intensely extracted and 17.5% alcohol. This is over-the-top winemaking, with powerful old vine fruit, and a big, extracted finish, with lingering toasty, hazelnut and vanilla highlights."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Septima,25.0,92.0,"This comes out swinging, with bullish berry and prune aromas that hint at being stewy but then pull back. It's saturated and tannic but not rough, with black fruit, chocolate, toast and pepper flavors. Minty and dark, with a licorice note on the finish. Drink now–2016."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Ebner-Ebenauer,25.0,92.0,"Pear drop aromas still dominate on the nose but yeasty spice breaks through. The palate is a similar mix of savory yeast and herbal flavors with the freshness of crunchy, green pear. This is inviting, savory and refreshing. The pepperiness of Grüner which is so often absent is abundant here. A wine with real personality and verve."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,25.0,92.0,"Palisade is Merlot-based in 2010, with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon filling out the blend. Muscular and complex, this is Merlot at a level rarely found at this price. Cherry, cassis, earth, graphite and mineral flavors mingle seamlessly. Sourced from a brilliant mix of vineyards including Champoux, Ciel du Cheval, DuBrul and Klipsun."
Merlot,US,Washington,Elevation Cellars,25.0,92.0,"This is an almost picture-perfect example of an excellent Washington Merlot, loaded with rich fruit flavors of plum and black cherry. The mouthfeel is satiny, the tannins round and ripe, with a smooth and supple finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Inman Family,25.0,92.0,"Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage. Made in a direct-press style, the dry, refreshing wine is light salmon in color and marked by aromatic grapefruit and strawberry, mouthfilling and juicy as a slice of watermelon in summer."
Malbec,US,Washington,Seven Hills,25.0,92.0,"Pure, almost crystalline in its expression of fruit, this 100% Malbec captures the essence of mountain berries. Juicy and perfectly balanced, it suggests a range of notes from tangerine to blueberry to wild raspberry, with lightly peppery, fine-grained tannins."
Merlot,US,Washington,Elevation Cellars,25.0,92.0,"This tastes far more expensive than the price would suggest. Sourced from both Red Mountain and Royal Slope vineyards, it's a smoke-, coffee- and licorice-laden wine, with expressive cassis and black cherry flavors at its core. It finishes with lovely, fine-grained tannins."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Forgeron,25.0,92.0,"Thoroughly delicious, this clever blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Viognier and Marsanne is a joyride of green and yellow fruit, citrus and pear, honeydew melon and sweet orange peel. It's complex and distinctive."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tenuta Cà Bolani,25.0,92.0,"Subtle and sophisticated, this opens with a floral and fruity fragrance of honeysuckle, peach and tropical fruit. The focused palate delivers creamy stone fruit, cantaloupe, citrus zest, mineral and a hint of candied ginger. It's impeccably balanced with fresh acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,25.0,92.0,"Hand-selected bunches from the Porto Franco estate of DFJ Vinhos went into this complex wine. It has solid tannins and a firm black-fruit character. The wood aging shows well and is already balanced, melding the fruit and structure together. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lestage,25.0,92.0,"Situated on one of the highest points of the Médoc, this vineyard is on deep gravel soil. It is one of a group of properties owned by the Chanfreau family of Château Fonréaud. This wine is firm and still young. However, it is already showing signs of the ripe black fruits and wood aging. Acidity and the firm structure will let the wine age. Drink from 2020."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de la Bonne Tonne,25.0,92.0,"The wine is structured and with intense acidity and a tight texture. A mineral character goes through the wine, contrasting with the red fruit. It is a serious wine that will repay aging, so drink from 2018. This organic vineyard is switching to biodynamic."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Beaumont,25.0,92.0,"With smoky aromas and structured tannins, this is still young and firm. Under those tannins, the black currant fruit is developing to give a ripe wine with fine acidity and structure. Drink from 2020."
Malbec-Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,25.0,92.0,"With its spice and mint aromas, this wine shows its 30% new wood aging strongly. On the palate, the mint flavors balance with rich black fruit and a strong, firmly tannic backbone. Rich and full of potential, it will be ready to drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Moncets,25.0,92.0,"This Merlot-dominated wine brings out both the juicy fruit typical of the vintage and a tight, smoky character that lends perfume. Still young, it's firmly structured and will age well. Drink from 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Valle da Fonte,25.0,92.0,Touriga Nacional is the principal component of this rich blend from the lower Douro vineyards of Valle da Fonte. It is a concentrated wine with black plum and spice flavors. They are underlined by the dark tannins and black chocolate. This makes for a wine that needs further aging. Drink from at least 2019.
Dolcetto,US,California,Klinker Brick,25.0,92.0,"Dramatic in aromas and opulent in flavors, this rich and gorgeously fruity wine has a great sense of layering and concentration, and a moderately tannic texture that feels layered and supple on the palate. Light spicy nuances dress up the focused black cherry and blueberry flavors."
Port,Portugal,Port,Fonseca,25.0,92.0,"A well-balanced wine, bringing both rich fruit and sweet tannins to go with dense concentration. There is ripeness from black jam and sweet jelly, followed by a good core of dryness."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ponzi,25.0,92.0,"Tons of raspberry, vanilla and licorice, backed by spice, coffee and all sorts of size and depth. The complexity is excellent, but so is the straightforward attitude it shows. Given time, it unfolds in layer upon layer of excitement. A gem of an appellation wine; it makes you wonder just how good the Ponzi Reserve will be."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Vetus,25.0,92.0,"The nose on this ripe Tinta de Toro is dense, bold and brimming with black-fruit aromas. Following the nose, this tastes of blackberry, cassis and various spices, while finishing black-fruit flavors are lightly herbal, spicy and complex. This offers a touch of everything good, and even more when it comes to ripe fruit. Drink through 2024."
Nero d'Avola,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Zisola,25.0,92.0,"Earthy aromas of leather, truffle, game and ripe black-skinned fruit lead the way on the nose of this smooth, savory red.

Riesling,US,New York,Standing Stone,25.0,92.0,"Layers of sweet orange marmalade, citrus rind and pollen mingle seamlessly into this deliciously honeyed ice wine. Intensely ripe, almost creamy in texture, its succulent sweetness is balanced neatly by a dazzling spray of tangerine acidity."
Merlot,US,Washington,Januik,25.0,92.0,"A sure-fire crowd-pleaser, this tightly-wound Merlot comes on very Cab-like, but with red fruits more than blue or black. It opens up into a broad mid-palate, showing well-balanced nuances of olive and earth, fresh herb, pepper and licorice. Dense, textural and smoky, it's delicious now or could be cellared for another five or six years."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,25.0,92.0,"From vines that surround the castle of Mercuès that crowns a rock above the River Lot, this wine is richly structured, packed with juicy black fruits as well as a firm dry core. It's a dense wine, dark with intense tannins. It is serious as well as opulently fruity. Drink this wine from 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Fouassier,25.0,92.0,"The Romans made it to Sancerre, hence the name of this wine. The flavors are rich, with a mineral edge to the notes of green fruits, plums and greengages and a serious citrus core. With its structure, the wine needs to age for 2–3 years."
Barbera,US,Washington,Tranche,25.0,92.0,"The soft but flavorful entry into a land of dark fruits, smoke and espresso barely hints at the wine to come. Give it time to breathe and it opens into a wonderfully complex, smooth and creamy wine with no rough edges. Pretty red fruit, seductive and lingering, is matched to hints of chocolate from 30 months in neutral barrels."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Château la Mascaronne,25.0,92.0,This rich wine is still young and has all its tannins intact as well as ripe black fruits that push out of the dense structure. Wood aging shows in a toasty edge that will round out. Wait and drink this wine from 2017.
Merlot,US,California,San Simeon,25.0,92.0,"Dense and luxurious aromas of oak-laden red currants, blueberry, peppercorns and melted dark chocolate greet the nose on this hearty bottling. The flavors are lighter than the nose suggests, yet the silky texture evolves quickly to deliver plenty of espresso bean, vanilla, blueberry and blackberry elements, all clinging to a strong tannic structure."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Talbott,25.0,92.0,"The nose of this excellently priced wine offers sour fruit from Montmorency cherries, earthiness from squeezed beets, spice from toasted sagebrush and umami from soy sauce. The palate is deep, with a sanguine character that's enhanced by lots of cracked pepper. It delivers plenty of action for the price."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Adelaida,25.0,92.0,"An inviting nose of buttery stewed cherries and red currants grows even more delicious thanks to smoked pork and a black-slate minerality. It's not quite so boisterous on the palate, but it features lovely cherry-pie notes, a slight orange-peel tang, some eucalyptus and a clean finish."
White Blend,US,Washington,Buty,25.0,92.0,"This shows a darker shade than most young whites, almost a burnished gold. Soft and complex, with ripe, slightly confected fruit flavors, it's super smooth, with honeysuckle highlights around waxy stone fruits. Excellent length."
Viognier,US,Washington,àMaurice,25.0,92.0,"Always a strong suit from àMaurice, the 2009 Viognier has a cocktail mix of lemon drop and botanical herbs and spices. Pungent, bright and deliciously lively, this is a thrilling, high-wire wine."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Maison Bleue,25.0,92.0,"A vibrant, flashy, fruit-laden nose introduces this lively G-S-M blend. The three component grapes all contribute different red, blue and purple berry flavors, nicely wound together with supporting acidity. Sappy, fresh and seductive, with the potential for a few years of aging."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Salomon-Undhof,25.0,92.0,"A beautifully concentrated wine that balances flavors of baked apple and spicy pepper. It feels full in the mouth, with a tense texture and intense acidity. Drink now, but better to hold for two years. Screwcap."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Maverick,25.0,92.0,"This is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now–2025."
Pinot Gris,New Zealand,Marlborough,Greywacke,25.0,92.0,"Struck flint and slightly smoky aromas give way to flavors of honeyed peaches and toasted nuts—not full on, like a Chardonnay might be, but restrained yet lush at the same time. In only a few years, this has quickly become one of New Zealand's best Pinot Gris."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Vincent Grall,25.0,92.0,"This intense wine comes from a small parcel of six acres. Produced from organically grown grapes, it is crisp, clean and with a directness that is both refreshing and initially shocking in its intensity. The wine is rich, full in the mouth, tight and still young. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Stephen Ross,25.0,92.0,"Pale yellow pink in color, this is one of the better rosés of the vintage, showing lush but restrained aromas of peach crème fraîche along with lemon zest and crushed limestone. There is fabulous energy and texture on the sip, where chalky flavors meet with red apple and a hint of rosewater."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Pizay,25.0,92.0,"From the famed slope of the Côtes de Py, this wine sums up both the great terroir and a great vintage. It has structure, with dry tannins permeating the ripe, rounded fruit. Its potential is considerable, anchored in great fruitiness and finishing acidity. Drink from 2019."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Klinker Brick,25.0,92.0,"Big, robust and powerful, this inky wine has wonderfully complex and assertive flavors, along with a thick, velvety and tannic texture. Flavors of espresso, dark chocolate and blueberries rush across the palate, linger in the chewy texture and last on the long finish. A bit bold to fully enjoy now, this will be best after 2019."
Grenache-Carignan,US,Washington,Syncline,25.0,92.0,"This is the only blend in Washington State where these two varieties play near-equal parts. Coming from a mixture of McKinley Springs and Alder Ridge vineyards, it offers aromas of brambly raspberries and herbs that lead to strikingly pure flavors and a texture that weakens the knees. An extended finish caps it off."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Weninger,25.0,92.0,Lifted notes of plump but crunchy red cherries and white pepper create an appetizing nose. The purity of those red cherries shines on the supple but fresh palate while white pepper reaches into every corner. Fine tannins give way to the central structural element of lip-smacking but appetizing freshness. This delivers crunch and juice and a whole lot of spice.
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Vincent Carême,25.0,92.0,"White peach aromas and powerful fruitiness give this wine great intensity. It is bone dry while rich, full of quince, pear and peach fruits. There is an extra richness from the edge of wood aging. The wine is still young and should not be drunk before 2020."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Wunsch & Mann,25.0,92.0,"Gentle, restrained notes of blossom and peach on the nose lead to a medium-sweet palate flavored with the gentle roundness of clear blossom honey. Grapefruit pithiness balances that slight sweetness, leaving a harmonious, restrained and very elegant wine. The finish echoes with honeysuckle."
Merlot-Cabernet,US,Washington,Soos Creek,25.0,92.0,"Palisade remains principally Merlot, with a little Cabernet Sauvignon also in the blend. Smoky and focused, it's a riot of loganberry, blueberry and other blue and purple fruits. The tangy mouthfeel brings in streaks of coffee and mineral, with a tart, elegant finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Fiddlehead,25.0,92.0,"A whiff of barrel smoke flows throughout aromas of fresh cut apple, pineapple and guava on the tropical-leaning nose. The palate is is fresh and light, the steely character giving way to a blend of tropical ripeness and lean cut-grass flavors on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de Corbiac,25.0,92.0,"Maturing well, this wine shows 2005's combination of richness and structure. It is built around firm, dusty tannins and big black-currant flavors, with a fine perfumed character from the wood aging. Ready to drink in a year, but it should age for several more."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Ken Wright,25.0,92.0,"This could be the best Pinot Blanc in Oregon right now, with lushness from barrel fermentation offset by the delicate balance throughout. Despite its modest 12.5% alcohol, this is a wine of considerable depth, with a mix of ripe yellow fruits and persistent, toasty highlights."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Casa Santos Lima,25.0,92.0,"Produced from the Boavista vineyard, the base of Casa Santos Lima, this wine comes from old vines. It is a serious, complex and structured wine that will develop well over many years. Dark fruits, dense tannins and really fresh acidity are integrated into a fine wine. Drink this impressive wine from 2019."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Tejo,Falua,25.0,92.0,"The fine qualities of Alicante Bouschet shine in this dense, darkly colored wine. With firm tannins and intense fruitiness combined, the wine has black plum, red currant and prominent acidity to balance the mineral texture. From an old single vineyard, the wine will need to age. Drink from 2018."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Gernot and Heike Heinrich,25.0,92.0,"Iron oxide, white pepper and blueberry are an enticing, aromatic trio but there's more to come. The palate is slender and pure fruit shines through. This has been handled with a light, knowing touch, creating an elegant, subtle wine that's not showy but all the more impressive for it."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,25.0,92.0,"Juicy yellow pear, fresh red apple and apple compote make for a very appetizing, refreshing nose. On the palate a spritz of lemon juice provides further freshness and zesty spiciness, accentuating the gorgeous apple fruit. Slender but fruity this will be a joy on a sunny day."
White Blend,US,Washington,Buty,25.0,92.0,"This outstanding Walla Walla boutique has established a track record for consistent improvement, and the white wines are best of show. Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits. Lovely aromas build a dense cloud of complex fruit, toast and caramel scents around the glass; once in the mouth the full-bodied fruit takes hold with lychee, peach and stone fruits. Immaculate and persistent, this stunning wine just keeps on coming."
Grenache,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,25.0,92.0,"A tremendous Grenache from the Foothills, estate grown from Beaucastel budwood and let to develop slowly, this wine has acres to go before it sleeps. Still superdense and dark with fruity plum and anise predominating, it'll grow old with tenderness and grace."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Salomon-Undhof,25.0,92.0,"Lemony lightness, coupled with zesty spritz on the palate make this a refreshing white with lots of focus, linearity and whistle-clean length. Floral notes around the edges add to the intrigue."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Sparkman,25.0,92.0,"Creamy and crisp—a nice trick—this refreshing Chardonnay livens up the palate with a mix of herb, celery, apple and Asian pear, rolling into a finish of caramel apple and toast. It has a light touch despite the 14.5% alcohol, and sits nicely in the back of the throat, inviting another glass."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lynmar,25.0,92.0,"A remarkably good wine at this price. Lemon meringue and custard meet creamy stone fruit in a balanced, decadent way, a suggestion of orange whip tugging at the edges of the palate. It glides down easy, impressing further with every sip, remaining balanced and graceful."
Chardonnay,US,California,Roblar,25.0,92.0,"This is a great example of what most would consider a straight-ahead and delicious California Chardonnay. The nose offers aromas of seared pineapple cake, vanilla soda and Meyer lemon, and the palate blends all of the typical elements: lemon juice acidity down the middle, minerality driven by slate and white rocks, apple and a bit of brown spice on the edges."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Victoria,Balgownie Estate,25.0,92.0,"This is classic Cabernet, from the reticent aromas of pencil shavings to the restrained flavors of cassis and cigar box. It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with enough dusty tannins to suggest longevity through at least 2020, despite an already velvety finish."
Zweigelt,Austria,Burgenland,Gernot and Heike Heinrich,25.0,92.0,"Faint but appetizing notes of crunchy, red cherry are joined by white pepper on the vivacious nose. This is a serious red, but by no means a heavy one. With its supple, soft but palpable tannins, as well as unashamed fresh cherry and spicy depth, this is an elegant, honest and beautiful rendition of Zweigelt. Medium bodied, it shows the elegant, spicy side of the variety without denying its lively, cherry-laden appeal."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Inman Family,25.0,92.0,"Made from a single-vineyard source of Pinot Noir grapes, this lovely pinkish-red wine is a celebration of wild strawberry. Dry, crisp and refreshing, it offers a twist of citrus on the finish and a floral backbone of honeysuckle."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Markus Molitor,25.0,92.0,"Demure apple and pear aromas belie the intensely honeyed peach and tropical fruit flavors that burst from this feather-light nectar. A crush of lemon-lime acidity cuts through the sweetness, leading a long, laser-focused finish. Drinks well now, but will develop well through at least 2025."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,25.0,92.0,"Green floral notes and lemon zest perfume this pristine, pretty kabinett. Zesty lemon-lime acidity lends a breathless elegance, brightened by sweet-tart streaks of mango and tangerine that pucker and delight. Drinks gorgeously now, but will continue to improve through at least 2020."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Ottella,25.0,92.0,"Aromas of fragrant white blossom, stone fruit, honeydew melon and tomato vine come together on this savory white. The round, medium-bodied palate offers creamy peach, tropical fruit, dried herb and an energizing mineral note. Bright acidity provides freshness and balance."
Chardonnay,US,California,Joyce,25.0,92.0,"Underripe lemons, yellow roses, cut apples and white lilies are bolstered by an intriguing, light cinnamon spice on the nose of this bottling. It's a bit like sipping on honeysuckle tea, as the palate is sizzling with acidity and packed with flavors of lemon oil, green apple skins and tangerine rinds."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château les Valentines,25.0,92.0,"A blend of Grenache and Cinsault, this wine comes from old vines in an estate revived in 1997 by Gilles Pons and Pascale Massenot. It's all about aromatic fruit, with grapefruit, pineapple and red currants playing in the flavors. A rich element contrasts pleasurably with the tight, crisp acidity. The wine will benefit from a few more months aging, so wait until the end of 2016."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,ZaHa,25.0,92.0,"Floral aromas of orange peel, rose petal and violet blend with more typical scents of tar and char. This Malbec blend is linear in feel but full, without an ounce of flab. Lightly spiced berry, red plum and chocolaty oak flavors finish toasty and tight, but with give. Drink 2017–2023."
Sémillon,Australia,South Australia,Elderton,25.0,92.0,"This medium-bodied wine is rich and dessert-sweet, with the warm, lush feel of the Barossa. Candied pineapple and dried pear aromas and flavors turn honeyed and long on the finish. Ready to drink."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Jean-Michel Dupré,25.0,92.0,"The wine is pure fruit, deliciously perfumed and with a rounded ripe character. It has acidity and structure although these are just supports for the bright fruits. The acidity at the end will allow it to age further, so drink from 2019."
Shiraz-Malbec,Australia,Victoria,Wild Duck Creek Estate,25.0,92.0,"Although this probably won't be easy to locate (only 64 of the 550 cases produced were imported to the U.S.), it is worth seeking out for its full, expansive mouthfeel; intense cassis and dark chocolate flavors; and long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025."
White Blend,US,Washington,DeLille,25.0,92.0,"In this new vintage there is a bit more Sauvignon Blanc (69%) than usual; the rest is Sémillon. Rich, oaky and expansive, it is an oak and texture-driven style, with the fruit—clean, slightly herbaceous, spicy and tart—playing second fiddle. Which is no criticism, because the delicious, over-the-top flavors, with layer upon layer of creamy complexity, and the rich, buttery finish just beg for lobster in a cream or butter sauce. Who can argue with that? Editors' Choice."
Sparkling Blend,Italy,Veneto,Bisol,25.0,92.0,"Scents of fragrant field flowers and white orchard fruit emerge on this refreshing sparkling wine. The vibrant, silky palate delivers crisp green apple, juicy pear and lime alongside tangy acidity and a refined, persistent bead. The finish is dry and clean."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Ponzi,25.0,92.0,"This reserve shows nice lime/citrus scents, hints of honey and a bit of sandalwood, which is quite interesting. It's an elegant, lightly spicy, complex and subtle wine, with delicious nuances and a dancer's balance."
Zinfandel,US,California,Artezin,25.0,92.0,"Classy in cherry-berry crumble and vanilla, this wine then expands into sophisticated bursts of white pepper, cinnamon and violets. Elegant and intriguing, it offers balance amidst bold flavor, finishing smooth and velvety."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Real Companhia Velha,25.0,92.0,"Aged for a year in oak, this is a rich, smooth and densely textured wine. Full of black fruits, the wine comes from a vineyard facing north across the Douro river. This impressive Reserva is still developing and should be ready from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,25.0,92.0,"This limited-release wine is a selection in the cellar from key parcels of this dramatic vineyard. With well-balanced spice and toast from 12 months in wood, it is richly endowed with dark fruits, rich black currants and black-plum flavors. The wine is full-bodied, rich and still packed with youthful fruitiness. Drink from 2019. If you go, hike up to their panoramic Casa Redonda at 1,800 feet."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,25.0,92.0,"A beautifully perfumed wine that comes from vines planted in the 1980s. Touches of the wood aging are apparent, along with the black plum and berry fruits. It's a dense while also elegant wine with acidity and fresh fruitiness alongside the complex structure. Drink this wine from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,California,J. Lohr,25.0,92.0,"Delicate aromas of lemon blossom, ripe Asian pear and a touch of yellow melon show on the nose of this versatile and tasty bottling. Grippy tension consumes the palate, led by lemon rind, but there's also a richer yellow-apple and pear core as well as a bit of pineapple."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lepe,25.0,92.0,"Slightly reductive in style, this wine shows aromas of lime skins and Brie-cheese rind before opening a bit toward lemon blossoms and raw cashews. The palate possesses a stunningly grippy and chalky texture, with sharp flavors of Key-lime rind and pomelo pith."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Maison Bleue,25.0,92.0,"Focus and elegance are the hallmarks of this wine, and it offers the fruit purity that characterizes virtually all of Maison Bleue's white wines. From the first sniff to the last, resonating swallow, this smells and tastes like a bowl full of peaches, pineapples and mixed stone fruits. It's tight and defined, and it doesn't have new oak influence."
Rkatsiteli,Georgia,Kakheti,Alaverdi Monastery Cellar,25.0,92.0,"From it's musky, perfumed to nose to it's intensely honeyed, dried-peach- and apricot-flavored palate, everything about this wine is mysterious and ethereal. Crafted by monks in an ancient Georgian monastery, this amber-hued wine is made from white grapes that were fermented and aged in clay vessels (qvevri) and that underwent extended skin contact, which resulted in a wine with puckering tannins and a richly textural mouthfeel."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Torre Mora,25.0,92.0,"Initially shy, after a little time in the glass this offers up aromas of red berry, fragrant blue flower, menthol, leather, herb and baking spice. The concentrated palate doles out wild cherry, mocha, raspberry, pipe tobacco and a mineral note framed in velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2022."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Williams & Humbert,25.0,92.0,"Powerful and precise, but with a cloudy color. On the nose and in the mouth this aged version of the venerable Drysack shows considerable freshness, tang and complexity. It's edgy yet deep, with caramel and mushroom notes going head to head with acidic intensity. Sherry is rarely more balanced than this; it's lively and rich, balanced yet racy."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Poças,25.0,92.0,"Wood-aged and almost black in color from the ripe, sweet berry fruit flavors and the velvet, opulent layers of polished wood and tannins. It's certainly a powerhouse of flavors, but the dry core keeps it from being out of balance, while the aftertaste is sweet and dry at the same time. Impressive."
Riesling,US,California,Tatomer,25.0,92.0,"Austria-trained, Santa Barbara County-based winemaker Graham Tatomer is causing a Riesling renaissance, thanks to wines like this with aromas of orange blossom, citrus rinds and hints of gasoline. With flavors of toasted nuts, lemon juice, tangerine pith and chalky grip, this is a great canvas for cellar aging to paint a remarkable wine. Drink 2018–2030."
White Blend,US,California,Terre Rouge,25.0,92.0,"Subtlety and reserve drive this full-bodied, round-textured white Rhône-style blend. The velvety mouthfeel is almost more notable than the subdued pear, melon and butter flavors. It's a wine for lingering over, because it reveals its best stuff after time in the glass. It leads with 49% Marsanne, plus Viognier, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Calon Ségur,25.0,92.0,"This wine is full of juicy Merlot, ripe with sweet tannins and jammy fruit. It is soft, with the freshness of the year as well as having hints of structure. It is ripe, beautifully fruity and will be ready to drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Ruby Hill Winery,25.0,92.0,"An unusually vivid gold color is the first indication that this medium-bodied wine will turn up the dials on flavor. Aromas resemble wood smoke, nutmeg, sandalwood and vanilla, while flavors are subtly fruity but largely oaky in the form of marzipan, toasted bread and other savory nuances. It is gorgeous in a voluptuous way."
Gewürztraminer,US,New York,Standing Stone,25.0,92.0,"Pristine white peach, lychee and honeysuckle notes are framed by a laser-edged strike of acidity in this vivacious ice wine. While its blossomy, perfumed exuberance is pure Gewürztraminer, its crystalline demeanor and wildflower-honey sweetness exhibits a classic ice-wine elegance."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram-Donauland,Soellner,25.0,92.0,"The rich, exposed soils of the Wagram ridge give richness to this wine. From old vines, it is impressive with spice, red pepper, cinnamon as well as green plum and mango fruits. Six months wood aging rounds it out. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,25.0,92.0,"Smooth and spicy, matching bright, tight, sweet-tart lemony fruit to nicely integrated barrel notes of sandalwood and graham cracker. The sleek structure, balanced for cellaring as well as immediate enjoyment."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,25.0,92.0,"The vineyard of this estate is shaped like an amphitheater facing south. The great exposure produces a full rich wine which moves easily between solid, dense and dry tannins and powerful black fruits. Together they make a ripe full-bodied wine that will age. Drink from 2021."
White Blend,South Africa,Stellenbosch,DeMorgenzon,25.0,92.0,"A blend of 26% Roussanne, 25% Chardonnay, 19% Grenache Blanc, 17% Chenin Blanc and 13% Viognier, this is a complex and layered wine. A soft flinty character lies atop a rich bouquet of yellow apple, ripe green melon, tangerine and honeycomb. The medium-weight palate offers both weight and refinement, with a smooth texture and ripe fruit flavors that are cut by ample acidity and lingering sweet-spice accents. Drink now–2019."
Moscato,US,California,Benessere,25.0,92.0,"With a beautiful honeysuckle nose, this dessert offering of 100% Moscato di Canelli is simply divine. Bright acidity balances against bold waves of honeycomb and gingerbread, alongside pear compote. It should be mandatory to serve it over ice cream."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Canada,British Columbia,Laughing Stock,25.0,92.0,"The impenetrably obscure label design makes this difficult to find, but once your hands are on the bottle, it's smooth sailing. A “second label” Bordeaux-style blend, this delicious, fruity and distinctive wine puts a wrap of tangy citrus around black cherry, coffee and licorice components. Malbec is the principal grape, with smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc."
Pinot Gris,New Zealand,Marlborough,Greywacke,25.0,92.0,"Full bodied, rich and carrying a bit of residual sugar, this is a fine example of the variety's potential in Marlborough. Smoky, grilled-pear notes add hints of honey and melon on the palate, where despite its richness, the wine soars into a long, velvety finish. Drink now–2020, at least."
Chardonnay,US,California,Rodney Strong,25.0,92.0,"This wine from cool sites in the county overdelivers for its price. Floral pear, nutmeg and orange peel flavors give it crispness and a savory bite, as tart grapefruit notes provide additional liveliness. Focused and bright, it's well worth stockpiling."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Secret Spot Wines,25.0,92.0,"This rich wine is made from old vines in a field blend. With its intense acidity and ripe apple fruitiness, the wine is full and concentrated. The spice and toastiness are at peace with the fruit, giving a balanced wine that will be ready to drink from late 2017."
Red Blend,Chile,Maule Valley,Casa Donoso,25.0,92.0,"A nose led by aromas of fine oak, raspberry and mild spices opens this blend of 80% Carmenère and 20% Malbec. In the mouth, it's nicely built, with delicate layering and not too much weight. Toasty, spicy red-fruit flavors include a tobacco note and the wine tastes a bit chocolaty on the tail end. Drink through 2023."
Champagne Blend,France,Champagne,Henri Abele,25.0,92.0,"Abelé lays claim to being the third-oldest Champagne house in Reims, and this stylish, sophisticated and thoroughly excellent bottle provides ample evidence that this is an important producer. From the textured, elegant, densely layered nose to the richly toasted flavors and the lingering, sensuous finish, it shows a confident touch with a continental flair."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,25.0,92.0,"Here is a wine that is slowly developing the most beautiful flavors. It is so perfumed with a waft of white flowers that translates onto the palate. It's balanced by a firm, steely character and layer upon layer of acidity. Age this wine and don't drink before 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,J. Lohr,25.0,92.0,"Aromas of orange bread, jasmine and poached Asian pear cling to a steely edge on the nose of this sharp and zesty bottling. Mouthwateringly ripe flavors of yellow pear, toasted almond, cashew and sea salt play on the palate."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,25.0,92.0,"Smoky notes mix with the lifted yarrow and lemon-peel notes of this wine. The palate is soft, rounded and medium-sweet, revealing a rich vein of peach compote flavors edged with bitter grapefruit pith. A wine of astonishing balance, it offers lively citrus notes and immense concentration."
Kerner,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,25.0,92.0,"This opens with alluring aromas of acacia, apricot, citrus and alpine herb. The linear, elegant palate offers juicy yellow peach, lemon zest, mint and hazelnut alongside crisp acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Passadouro,25.0,92.0,"From old vines, this is a wine of great structure and depth. Serious tannins and dark fruits give a dense, brooding character. This solid, powerful and mineral-driven wine is still young, still coming together. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Bernardus,25.0,92.0,"Crushed orange peels, plump lemon blossoms, spun sugar, clarified butter and a slight almond oil touch combine for a lush, layered nose on this bottling from the Carmel Valley producer. The palate presents an expert balance between salt, butter and almond warmth aand tingling, lime-led acidity. Will please both lovers of classic Cali chard and acid-heads."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Rimauresq,25.0,92.0,"Structured, tight and mineral, this wine comes from a selection of old vines in a northwest-facing vineyard on the Rimauresq estate. It offers a tang, along with a firm structure and concentration. A fruitier aftertaste will show through more strongly by late 2016."
Riesling,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,25.0,92.0,"Steely. Cool fruit joins an immense series of flavors—crisp citrus, lime zest, pink grapefruit in the tightest texture. For aging over 3–4 years, probably longer."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mascota,25.0,92.0,"With robust aromas of cola, coffee, dry leaves and blackberry, this lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc outperforms its reasonable price tag. Despite being big and dark, the palate is juicy in feel. Flavors of cassis and black cherry are backed by chocolate and mocha, while the finish is deep and pure, with toasty notes and additional chocolate. Drink through 2018."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Ardenvoir,25.0,92.0,"A new offering from Ardenvoir, this Chardonnay is as Burgundian as any in Washington. Fine, tart and racy fruit is married to top-notch French oak. The meld of vivid apple and citrus flavors to mineral-soaked acidity and a frame of toasted coconut is marvelously seductive. Ageworthy but already delicious."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Tablas Creek,25.0,92.0,"This blend of 55% Syrah, 29% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre and 6% Counoise offers boisterous yet elegant aromas of blackberry, boysenberry and dried violet that are met with hints of crushed marjoram and white pepper. Once sipped, mulberry and exotic plum flavors mesh with wild mint on a brooding yet bright and fresh palate."
Albariño,US,Oregon,Treos,25.0,92.0,"Albariño is not the first grape that springs to mind when thoughts turn to Willamette Valley wines, but what a pleasant discovery this is. A spicy, refreshing, New World take on this Spanish variety, here are layers of citrus rind—lemon, lime and grapefruit—that broaden out into like flavors. Keep tasting and satsuma orange and a bit of pineapple come into play. An absolute delight."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Les Belles Collines,25.0,92.0,"Crisp, clean flavors of apple and apricot shine in this medium-bodied, lively and dry white, an ideal companion at the table. A sly finish of lemon peel adds to its refreshment, and it's best enjoyed now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Mettler Family Vineyards,25.0,92.0,"This wine is powerful and concentrated but sophisticated, too. It offers a medley of ripe fruit, dark spice, mouthfilling texture and age-worthy structure. The color is inky-dark and the aromas cassis-laden, with baking spice and a light smoky accent. The flavors recall dark chocolate and macerated cherries. Best after 2022."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,René Muré,25.0,92.0,"There is a savory touch of salt and herb amidst the fruity mirabelle plum notes on the nose. The palate shows a lovely background of autolytic richness, akin to sponge and rye bread and also has a piquant salty accent that entices all the way to the lemony bright finish. The mousse is fine and elegant, the finish is long and dry."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Terre Rouge,25.0,92.0,Juicy and peppery this is everything one could want in a Mourvèdre—smooth and delicious with a backbone of earthy leather.
Port,Portugal,Douro,Warre's,25.0,92.0,"Light in color, refined in the nose, and intense in the mouth. It's packed with toffee, nuts, dried apricot and other delicious and sophisticated flavors. There's dynamite fruit quality here, but it's the creamy nuttiness on the palate and the finish that steals the show."
Chardonnay,US,California,J. Lohr,25.0,92.0,"A faint smoky character wafts through warm, inviting aromas of lemon peels, nectarine and sea salt on the nose of this wine from Monterey County. There is a lot of energetic acidity on the palate, where even flavors of apple and pear are cut by lemon-lime briskness and a briny character."
Red Blend,Italy,Central Italy,Perticaia,25.0,92.0,"Vibrant and savory, this blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Colorino boasts juicy black cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, while notes of white pepper and cinnamon add depth. It's balanced and delicious with fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2016."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,25.0,92.0,"Tender notes of ripe, juicy pear with more golden inflections of ripe yellow plum and peach on nose and palate close into a central seam of bright, sprightly and immensely toning acidity. Lightness, concentration and lip-smacking freshness are framed by rounded fruit. Structure and grace signal ageing potential. The finish is wonderfully dry and full of verve."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Hoopla,25.0,92.0,"A wonderful array of aromas wafts up from the glass, resembling pencil shavings (a good thing!), cigar box, touch of earthiness and cherry compote. The mouthfeel is luxurious; layered flavors of black currant, black cherry, chocolate and clove stay lively through the long finish. It drinks well now, but will improve through at least 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta das Marias,25.0,92.0,"From vines in the heart of the Dão, this is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz. It is rich with both tannins and black fruits. The flavors of the wood aging are still there and need to soften out. Otherwise, this is a very fine that will repay aging. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Duplessis,25.0,92.0,"Dating back at least to the 17th century, Duplessis was one a hunting lodge. Today, owned by the Lurton family, it has produced a dark and dense wine that has a dry structure at the moment, with a strong extraction character. However, the potential black fruits promise future richness. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Baret,25.0,92.0,"Dense and structured, this ripe and fruity wine features attractive dense tannins that are balanced by rich black-currant fruit flavors.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Calheiros Cruz,25.0,92.0,"This ripe, soft wine comes from a company based in Régua in the western end of the Douro vineyards.

Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Pinto,25.0,92.0,"Following the current fashion in Portugal for single-varietal wines, this is a rich, structured take on what has become the country's national grape. Powerful and with a dense structure, it retains some of the perfumed elegance that is one of Touriga Nacional's hallmarks. The tannins will age further and the fruit will come out more strongly. Drink from 2018."
Red Blend,US,California,Tenshen,25.0,92.0,"A project by Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi, this is a whopper of a wine for the price tag. Black cherry, oregano, eucalyptus and dried sage show on the nose. The palate packs a mix of herbal seasonings, including anise and spearmint, alongside black cherry and baked blueberry fruit."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Mount Langi Ghiran,25.0,92.0,"A great value in ready-to-drink, savory, complex Shiraz, the 2009 Cliff Edge boasts plenty of smoky, bacony notes, which add a Rhône-like edge to the blueberry and plum fruit. Black olives chime in, adding even more savory complexity, while the tannins are silky. Drink now–2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Ancestrale,25.0,92.0,"Mike Sinor's pet-nat experiment scored big in 2016. This pink sparkler offers complex yeasty bread, crushed rock and turned clay aromas. Zingy and racy, it grabs hold of the palate. It's all about fascinating texture and refreshing acidity."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Domaine Capmartin,25.0,92.0,"Dense tannins and powerful black fruits reinforce the almost-black color of the wine.

Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,25.0,92.0,"This distinctive and bold dry wine has a flavor signature that incorporates blueberry, black olive and blackberry, while filling the mouth with fine-grained tannins and full body. Those tannins and firm acidity give it a great, grippy texture and help extend the finish."
Loureiro,Portugal,Minho,Quinta do Ameal,25.0,92.0,"This is a rarity —wood-aged Vinho Verde. It works beautifully, the floral flavors of the Loureiro grape balanced with a smooth texture. The green fruit flavors dominate, just broadened by the wood."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Villa Maria,25.0,92.0,"This terrific Sauvignon Blanc is marked by slightly pungent notes of green tomato or crushed tomato leaf, seamlessly married to smooth, ripe, tropical fruit. It's a bit creamy in texture, almost lush, with a long, mouthcoating finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Dopff Au Moulin,25.0,92.0,"The nose is shy and merely hints at lemon zestiness. The palate also opens with lemon zest but in a very concentrated full-on fashion with a citrus blast. There is a softer touch of orange and tangerine, too. The freshness is bundled and has ample drive and energy. This certainly is juicy, citrus fresh and off dry. The finish is whistle-clean and very refreshing."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,La Chablisienne,25.0,92.0,"This wine has an austere character with a hint of tannins in its structure. Crisp apple backs up the bright luminous acidity. Almost startlingly fresh, it needs time in the bottle—drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Sagrado,25.0,92.0,"In the ownership of the Cálem family since the 19th century, Sagrado produces firmly structured wines. This dark and dense example is only just ready to drink. It is a powerful and juicy wine, full of opulent black fruits that are balanced by acidity."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Winzer Krems,25.0,92.0,"The steep Pfaffenberg vineyard, sloping straight down to the Danube River, is one of the top vineyards in Krems.

Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Riojanas,25.0,92.0,"Dusty aromas of cocoa, herbs and spice grace prune and plum scents. This is firm, layered and healthy in mouthfeel. Flavors of baked plum, blackberry and mocha finish dry and well balanced. This has more than a few years left in it. Drink through 2023."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Villa Ponciago,25.0,92.0,"With the same winemaking team as Bouchard Père et Fils in Burgundy, this wine is rich and generous. It has great red fruits and hints of the toast from the wood aging of part of the wine. It is a generous wine that will age well over the next year, so drink from late 2017."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Losada,25.0,92.0,"Concentrated, smoky aromas of dark fruits, graphite and toast are direct and potent. A grabby mouthfeel is defined by elastic, staunch tannins. Blackberry, cassis and a hint of lemony oak create a fine flavor profile, while the finish is loamy and tastes of licorice and peppery spices. Drink through 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Tour des Gendres,25.0,92.0,"Profiting from the ripe 2009 vintage, this full, elegant wine has a dense, concentrated texture. Named in memory of winemaker Luc de Conti's father, this is packed with stylish blackberry fruit and ripe tannins. Age for at least four years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,25.0,92.0,"A panoply of pear notes: the freshly cut peel of Conference, the juicy flesh of Bartlett, the scented fruitfulness of Comice. These full-fruited notes dominate nose and palate beautifully and are deftly framed with zesty lemon freshness. Tons of flavor in a light-bodied but very convincing package."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey,25.0,92.0,"Balanced and fruity, this ripe, sweet wine delivers both botrytis and generous fruit. It has fine acidity to cut through the richness, giving intense sweetness and a dry core. Drink from 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Pilet,25.0,92.0,"Dusty tannins and ripe fruit set the scene for this wine, which is rich in both structure and black fruit. With its concentration, it is sure to develop well, likely to mature easily over several years. Drink from 2020."
Barbera,US,California,Le Mulet Rouge,25.0,92.0,"This is one of the most Italian-tasting wines made in California, because of its complex blend of spicy earthy characters and moderate fruit flavors, grippy tannins and good acidity. It's nicely dry, well balanced, has interesting oaky accents on top of mildly fruity and also savory notes. Unusual because it's not vintage dated, but don't let that dissuade."
Red Blend,US,California,Atrea,25.0,92.0,"This is a well-made, well-balanced and sophisticated wine from the new-oak, salt and pepper aromas to the tasty blackberry and baking spice flavors to the generous and mouthcoating texture. Firmly tannic, the wine's concentrated fruit and spice flavors come through nicely on the palate and linger on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Windemere,25.0,92.0,"There's a nice dollop of warm butter on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1975, but it's well restrained and enhanced by vanilla yogurt and graphite aromas. A crushed sea-shell minerality shines on the palate, where apple flesh, graphite and lemon rinds combine for a full sipping experience."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Chalone Vineyard,25.0,92.0,"These old, head-trained bush vines make for stunning wines year after year. This vintage shows lemon rind, orange-laced tonic water, yellow pear and a fragrant chilled Pink Lady apple element on the nose. The palate is all about tense texture, but also shows refreshing flavors of green pluot, tart plum and a touch of sweet basil."
Albariño,US,California,Verdad,25.0,92.0,"Louisa Sawyer Lindquist's racy bottling would make the Rías Baixas crowd happy. Asian pear, nectarine, crushed rock and pithy citrus aromas bring great tension to the nose. The palate delivers a chalky minerality, bright and fresh acidity and refreshing if slightly sour lime peel flavors."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Stoller,25.0,92.0,"Some kind of magic is happening here. As the lowest-priced Chardonnay in Stoller's lineup, this may turn out to be your favorite. Using all-stainless steel, this sleek style brings out the aromatics, texture and detail. There's tensile strength here, herb-tinged accents, clean and juicy citrus-inflected fruit and superb balance throughout."
Assyrtiko,Greece,Santorini,Tselepos,25.0,92.0,"With its sea salt, lemon peel and fresh-fruit aromas, this wine offers focus and finesse from the beginning. On the palate, bright lemon and lime peel flavors and a pronounced mineral edge are beautifully integrated. This is a terroir-driven white that's made for fresh fish and vegetarian dishes."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,25.0,92.0,"The pure scent of freshly cut, ripe, green pear makes for a very appetizing, fruity nose. The palate adds a subtle white-pepper edge to this intense but juicily refreshing pear fruit. Green apple pops up, as well as bright and lively lemon. All this happens on a smooth and rounded body, full of charm but with a serious, savory core."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Maetierra Dominum,25.0,92.0,"An attractive mix of spiced plum, fresh tomato, herb, tobacco and vanilla aromas are the intro to this excellent wine from a not-good vintage. The palate is creamy but vital, with roasted plum, integrated oak and savory flavors. A smooth but intense finish brings this home. Drink through 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Fiddlehead,25.0,92.0,"This bottling masterfully handles the young appellation's tropically inclined fruit, with apple candy aromas and a soft, rich mouthfeel. The flavors nod briefly toward the traditional greener, grassy side of the grape, but it's a smoother experience, less biting, with a hint of barrel smoke."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,McCrea Cellars,25.0,92.0,"The blend of these four Rhône white grapes—47% Grenache Blanc, 32% Marsanne, 16% Roussanne, 5% Picpoul—outshines their individual bottlings. Some sort of magic accrues. The Sirocco is supple, creamy and packed with aromas and flavors of citrus blossom, flesh and rind. It's got a peaches-and-cream mouthfeel, and a lick of butterscotch in the lush finish."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Rejadorada,25.0,92.0,"This is a polished, smooth, ripe-smelling Toro with an inky color and earthy undertones to the bouquet. Full, tannic and voluminous, this tastes mostly of blackberry and prune, while the finish is similar in taste and lush in texture. This is more forward and ripe than complex and nuanced; drink through 2021."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alpamanta,25.0,92.0,"Crisp, toasty aromas of black cherry and cassis are impressive. This is a full-bodied Malbec with edgy tannins that stop short of being hard. Berry, chocolate and woodspice flavors finish smooth, long and complex, with a welcome note of cedar. Drink through 2020."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Dão,Caves da Montanha,25.0,92.0,This is a good reminder that Touriga Nacional comes from originally from the Dão. The wine has power and dense tannins while also having a strongly textured character that shows up the granite soil of the region. The wine is just maturing and will be at its best from 2017.
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Villa Cafaggio,25.0,92.0,"This is a beautiful wine from a great vintage. It has a rich fragrance of underbrush, mushroom and truffle, with ripe black-cherry, mint and rosemary accents. It's still young with exuberant but supple tannins and racy acidity. Drink 2016–2025."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner,25.0,92.0,"Inviting, even beguiling aromas of lovely ripe and tart apple fruit play on the nose. They are fully and charmingly expressed on the dry fresh palate. Lemon freshness brightens everything and makes for a clean enticing finish. Lovely classy Riesling."
Rhône-style Red Blend,Israel,Galilee,Jacques Capsouto,25.0,92.0,"Deep violet red in the glass, this wine has a nose of black cherry, herbes de Provence and lavender. It is very smooth on entry, with flavors of black cherry, white chocolate, anisette and violet. Velvety tannins do not overstay their welcome, making way for a licorice and orange-tinged finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Rolland,25.0,92.0,"Aromas of balsam wood, blackberry, asphalt, leather and peppercorn combine into a complex and appealing whole. This is big and tannic, but with snappy acidity, it's harmonious. Blackberry, cassis and boysenberry flavors show chocolaty richness, while a moderately hot finish keeps things going in the right direction; drink through 2020."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Teso La Monja,25.0,92.0,"With its inky black color and intense, dense aromas of black fruits, leather, spice and herbs, Almirez is a poster child for Toro. The palate is firm but offers cushion, while flavors of toast, wood, roasted berry, cassis and licorice finish long, wild and leathery. Drink through 2019."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Les Trouvés,25.0,92.0,"Mourvèdre (62%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Syrah (21%) and Grenache. It's aromatic and appealing, with notes of roasted meat, black pepper, herb and plum. The red- and black-fruit flavors are concentrated and bring a compelling sense of texture. Smoke and savory flavors linger on the finish. It's a standout at this price."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Lumen,25.0,92.0,"Winemaker Lane Tanner and proprietor Will Henry are conquering this grape with more finesse each vintage. Light pink grapefruit, Asian pear and fragrant lime blossoms are inviting on the nose, with crisp yet chalky aromas. The palate presents light stone-fruit flavors held together by a pomelo-led acidity and grippy mouthfeel."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,25.0,92.0,"This impressive bottling is brightly substantial and tensely textured, lively in acidity and yet brimming with complexity. Stony lemon and peach ride a fruitful wave of flavor and find balance between sweet ripeness and memorable crispness."
Shiraz,Australia,New South Wales,Tyrrell's,25.0,92.0,"The Tyrrell family was excited about its 2014s when I visited there earlier this year, and this suggests their ebullience is well founded. The aromas are fresh and floral, loaded with cherry-berry fruit and a hint of cracked pepper, while on the palate, the wine is medium bodied and supple, with a long, peppery, silky finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Viu Manent,25.0,92.0,"Is this the best Cabernet that Viu Manent has ever bottled? We think it very well might be; the wine is midnight madness, meaning it's dark as night and richly draped with blackberry, cassis, black plum and overall lushness. It's a hulk of a wine, with jammy fruit, fine tannic structure and handsome shadings. Drinkable now and probably better over the next two or three years."
Merlot,US,Washington,Januik,25.0,92.0,"With grapes coming from Weinbau, Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval vineyards, among others, this wine offers brooding aromas of dark raspberries and bittersweet chocolate. The oak (half new French) provides a perfect complement, with flavors of coffee and spice mixing with dark fruit. It's hard to put the glass down."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,25.0,92.0,"Situated high on a rock overlooking the river Lot, Château de Mercuès, now a luxury hotel, dates from the 13th century. The wine is as ripe and luxurious as the hotel. It is a dense, solid and structured Malbec, with its powerful tannins balanced by big, bold black fruits. It's a classic wine for serious aging, so wait until 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Cadence,25.0,92.0,"Despite coming from declassified barrels from the winery's other programs, the quality still hits a very high mark on this blend of Cabernet Franc (33%), Cabernet Sauvignon (29%), Merlot (29%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas of cranberry, herbs, plum and mineral are generous followed by good depth to the fruit flavors and bitters on the finish. As always with this winery, it's the balance of acid and tannins that most impresses. Give a one hour decant."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaines Dominique Piron,25.0,92.0,"A blend from different vineyards of the Fleurie appellation, this wine is deliciously elegant and floral. Crisp red fruits are sustained by acidity and a juicy character. As often with this appellation, it is a wine to age and will be better from 2018."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Girolamo Russo,25.0,92.0,"Made with Nerello Mascalese and 5% Nerello Cappuccio, this structured but elegant wine opens with aromas of underbrush, mature black fruit and graphite. The balanced palate delivers black cherry, Mediterranean herb and mineral that are supported by a tannic backbone."
Riesling,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,25.0,92.0,"A wonderfully light-footed Riesling that has an energetic, lively core fizzing with lemon freshness and verve. There is a very light touch here, but despite all this filigree structure there is depth and a profound sense of pure citrus flavor. This really gets under your skin with its very own, tiptoeing, featherlight way. The pure lemons last and last."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de Ventozelo,25.0,92.0,"Still young, this is a complex wine. It has layers of dusty tannins, spiced fruits, ripe blackberries and a dark structure. Black chocolate and licorice feed extra richness into the wine. Very smooth aftertaste."
Roussanne,US,Washington,Lauren Ashton Cellars,25.0,92.0,"An excellent follow-up to the 2011 Roussanne, this elegant, precise wine intrigues from the first sniffs of camomile, lemon zest and honeysuckle, right on through a full-bodied middle with a range of stone fruits. There's a refreshing baseline of wet stone, and some very pretty toast from a mix of new, neutral oak and stainless fermentations."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château des Jacques,25.0,92.0,"Wines from this great producer have developed a tendency towards too much alcohol for a wine from Beaujolais. It is a shame because otherwise this is a generous structured cru wine that is finely balanced. With tannins and delicious acidity, the wine is ready to develop further. Drink from 2018."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine des Marrans,25.0,92.0,"This cru is a solid wine. It has a dense structure spearheaded by the tannins and lifted by acidity. Black plum and berry fruits are still developing behind the firm facade. It will take some time to develop, so wait until early 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Valle da Fonte,25.0,92.0,"Big damson fruits dominate this rich wine. The wood aging has smoothed out some of the dense tannins although the wine remains firm and solid. There's a sense of power behind the juicy dark fruits and the dry core. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Rede,25.0,92.0,"Selected fruit has been barrel-fermented to give this rich and toasty wine. It has great structure, a concentrated texture that brings out both acidity and delicious acidity. A good layer of spice from the wood blends well with pear and peach fruits. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Baden,Franz Keller,25.0,92.0,"Sweet spice and dried lavender accent blackberry and cherry aromas on this lush, lavish Pinot Noir. It's rich in body and fruit, but nuanced by shades of granite and dried leaves, as well as a nervy streak of acidity. Supple and warm on the palate, it finishes with a fringe of soft, delicate tannins."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,25.0,92.0,"The three Himmelreich '09 spätleses tasted were all terrific, with this example showing great intensity and power without excessive weight. Apple and lime notes are underscored by something akin to liquid slate, while citrus notes linger on the long, vibrant finish."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,25.0,92.0,"An intense flavor of cinnamon- and pepper-dusted red cherries pervades nose and palate, with additional notes of white pepper spice. There is an ever so slight tannic grip, like the touch of a kitten's paw. The purity of the red cherry fruit soars with every sip and the overall picture is one of full-flavored, enticing but slender joy. This is just how Zweigelt should be."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Smith & Hook,25.0,92.0,"Truly a wine that overdelivers, this packs molten fudge cake, vanilla-laced black-currant syrup and chocolate pudding with a fresh sprig of mint on the nose. The palate is soft and dynamic, with ripe black currants given complexity though licorice and butter-softened roasting herbs, all wrapped in tannins that keep the flavors steady throughout."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Husch,25.0,92.0,"Husch is one of the original Anderson Valley wineries and has not been a particular Pinot Noir star, but this fantastic 2014 may start a trend. Fresh and alive, the wine is medium bodied but packs lots of tangy cherry and almost jammy plum flavors into a smooth but lightly tannic texture that provides great structure. Simply delicious, it's balanced well enough to enjoy time after time."
Chardonnay,US,California,Hahn,25.0,92.0,"There's an exciting array of aromas on the nose of this wine, with honeydew melon, citrus candy and barely ripe cantaloupe gaining complexity thanks to fresh scents of chive, oregano and thyme. It's light and easy on the palate, with lots of yellow grapefruit freshness, a pithy edge and a singing acidity on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Vincent Vineyards,25.0,92.0,"Enticing aromas of white lilies, nectarines, white peach, honey-lime water and chalky stone hit the nose on this wine from a new vineyard on Highway 154 in the likely-to-be-named Los Olivos District. The palate is creamy down the center but with tangy edges, offering flavors of lime yogurt and pink grapefruit pith."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Miroballi Wines,25.0,92.0,"This bottling from young winemaker Michael Miroballi shows lime blossom, chalk, fresh rain on concrete and nectarine flesh on the nose. The palate is exuberant with flavors but they're not ripe, instead showing lime peels and juice, a cement-like grip and a buzzing sensation that overtakes the mouth like a Sichuan peppercorn."
Roussanne,US,Washington,Lauren Ashton Cellars,25.0,92.0,"This stylish, well-defined Roussanne is crisp as a cucumber, with fruit flavors of citrus, green berry, apple and melon. This is immaculate and beautifully balanced."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,25.0,92.0,"In this still-young wine, flavors of wood aging show strongly and the ripe and rich fruit still needs time to develop. As it does, the blend of Antão Vaz, Verdelho and Viognier will bring out a great perfumed character and rich fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Carlos Basso,25.0,92.0,"Warm and complete, with oak-influenced char and licorice along with black fruits on the bouquet. An elegant Uco Valley specimen with refined, full-force flavors of cola, blackberry, tobacco and chocolate. Turns more complex and satisfying on the finish. Drink this high-quality value now through 2013. A blend of Malbec at 50%, with Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah."
Syrah,US,Washington,Darby,25.0,92.0,"Syrah is a core strength of Darby, and as with previous vintages, this is dense and aromatic, leading from floral scents into a dark, almost broodingly deep core of blackberries, cassis and pepper. Full-bodied and 14.4% alcohol, this captures the essential strengths of Washington Syrah, done as a fruit-driven, berry-laden style."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,25.0,92.0,"A single vineyard, 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deep, dark, dense, chewy and tannic. Yet it still captures some delicate floral aromas as well as smoke and rock and black fruits. You go from flower to fruit to earth and black olive in a rush of full-bodied flavor."
Grenache,US,Washington,Maison Bleue,25.0,92.0,"Fragrant and spicy, this opens with green pepper notes and boatloads of prickly/brambly raspberry/strawberry fruit. From a cool vintage, the blend includes 15% Syrah. It's nicely handled, with great penetration and a dancer's precision."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Stewart Cellars,25.0,92.0,"Fermented in stainless steel and neutral oak, this light-bodied, well-structured white impresses with pretty citrus blossom scents and tart, high-toned acidity. Pungent with lemon and lime flavor, it develops bolder melon and pear notes as it opens in the glass."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Carnuntum,Muhr-Van der Niepoort,25.0,92.0,"Lovely tart cranberry and just-ripe blueberry appear on the nose. The palate presents similarly appetizing crunchy red fruit that's pure and unpretentiously delicious, spiced with cinnamon and white pepper and brimming with freshness and verve. Don't let the light body deceive you; this has depth and will develop. Drink now–2025."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,25.0,92.0,"This wine's nose is still closed, but its palate presents velvety, cinnamon- and vanilla-tinged black cherry fruit. The tannic structure acts like a velvet grip around its pleasantly fruit-dense core. That richness is countered by freshness in a package that's sure to give lots of pleasure through 2022."
Pinot Blanc,Austria,Burgenland,Prieler,25.0,92.0,"A faint touch of hazelnut plays on the lemon aromas of the nose. The palate has a lingering combination of the two, plus a zesty, phenolic texture that has slight but pleasantly bitter edges plus more fruit, akin to ripe, yellow apple. This is a rounded Pinot Blanc with potential. Drink now–2022."
Zierfandler-Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Stift Klosterneuburg,25.0,92.0,"Aromatic notions of summer blossom and freshly cut pear appear on the nose. The palate brings out ripe, rounded and juicy pear notes alongside a textured, slightly phenolic midpalate that adds backbone. Rounded with rich fruit, it has a briskly clean finish."
Black Muscat,US,Washington,Hyatt,25.0,92.0,"What a pleasant surprise awaits you here: It's delectable, decadent and downright delicious. Fabulous mango, lime, and peach aromas parade upward in advance of vivid nectarine and pink grapefruit flavors. This charmer, which features perfect vitality and acidity, is almost too easy to drink and enjoy."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Case Paolin,25.0,92.0,"Slightly fizzy and incredibly fragrant, this radiant sparkler boasts heady scents of honeysuckle, lemon blossom and white stone fruit. The crisp dry palate delivers green apple, Bartlett pear, citrus zest and a saline note alongside vibrant acidity and lightly foaming bubbles. Fermented in the bottle, it has some sediment at the bottom that adds flavor and complexity."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Domaine Bousquet,25.0,92.0,"Tarry aromas of blackberry and freshly applied asphalt set up a full-bodied palate with sandpaper tannins. Blackberry and toast flavors taste a little burnt, while an oak-based blackened element is present on a stout finish. Drink this blocky and lusty Malbec through 2023."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Domdechant Werner,25.0,92.0,"A shower of crushed minerals lends transparency to this fleshy dry Riesling. It's bold in body and alcohol, heaving lusciously with ripe tangerine, peach and nectarine flavors, but zesty acidity adds levity. The finish is warm and smoky but long and languorous."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,25.0,92.0,"The flagship estate of the Vigouroux family, this medieval castle on a hill is also a hotel. The vineyard produces powerful wines like this, packed with dusty tannins and with dark berry fruits and fine concentration. It is a wine to age, drink from 2020."
Chardonnay,Austria,Burgenland,Hafner Kosher,25.0,92.0,"The headiness of roasted hazelnuts, Bourbon vanilla and blossom honey have an immense seductive power. The palate follows up with precision, concentration and long length. This oak-aged TBA is a mature, full package that will easily charm anyone—now or in years to come."
Chardonnay,US,California,Conn Creek,25.0,92.0,"A streak of confectionary nougat and lemony acidity combine for a smooth, well-integrated wine, full bodied in style, that's lip-smacking in apple-cider juiciness on the finish."
Riesling,Austria,Wagram,Josef Ehmoser,25.0,92.0,"Crunchy, tart but ripe apples abound on the nose and even more on the palate. This is reminiscent of a red-cheeked Cox's Orange Pippin apple and offers the same thrill and contrast between ripe fruit and crispness. This is dangerously animating and racy. It will make conversation sparkle. Finishes with a lasting apple tang."
Syrah,US,Washington,Structure,25.0,92.0,"The aromas are quite locked up at present, with notes of cranberry, cherry, herb and wood spice. On the palate, the dark-fruit flavors show the warmth of the vintage, with a spine of firm tannins providing support."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Jérémie Huchet,25.0,92.0,"Old vines, some dating from 1914, form the basis of this impressive wine. They give it concentration while the stone and sand soil brings even more richness. With its crisp acidity, lemon and grapefruit fruit, and creamy texture, the wine is refreshing and ready to drink."
Riesling,US,New York,N. Kendall Wines,25.0,92.0,"Laser-edged shards of lime and flint anchor this bright bristling dry Riesling. It's lean and lithe yet penetratingly ripe, offering loads of fresh lemon and quince flavors. The finish is perfumed, marked by notes of smoke and white blossom and a lingering lime pith astringency. Ready to drink now but should age well till 2025."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Les Vignobles Gueissard,25.0,92.0,"The first vintage of this wine from the Gueissard family's Bandol vineyard is made from old vines and aged for 18 months in wood. Rich and concentrated with wonderful spice from the 70% Mourvèdre, the wine is an impressive medley of dark fruits, black currant and spice from the wood aging. It needs to age longer; drink from 2018."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Salomon-Undhof,25.0,92.0,"The purest notes of ripe lemon zest are the first to rise from the glass, then comes a slight notion of yeast—so fresh is this wine. There is a savoury timbre on all this gleaming citrus sleekness, adding extra interest and verve. Utterly linear and driven, this will relax into a sleek, sound beauty with just a little more bottle age. Ready from summer 2016 and for at least a decade after."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Convento de Las Claras,25.0,92.0,"This immediately presents itself in fine fashion. Ripe berry, generous oak and rooty notes form a complex nose. Spot on across the palate, with depth and freshness, this tastes of cherry, blackberry and mocha. A deep finish with exemplary balance confirms both quality and value. Drink through 2019."
Syrah,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Elephant Hill,25.0,92.0,"This is a terrific American debut for this winery, which blends Syrah from the Gimblett Gravels and Te Awanga subregions. It's full-bodied and richly textured, with bold blueberry and raspberry fruit combining seamlessly with savory notes of black olive and marinated beef. Drink now–2025."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Laporte,25.0,92.0,"In its youthful state, the wine has an earthy character that will soon move into a ripe, fruity while always structured state. Rich and  fruity now, it's likely to become a serious, ageworthy wine."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Bois de Rolland,25.0,92.0,"Well-balanced, ripe and toasty, it has all the elements in the right place. It's rich, packed with spice, apricot and red apple fruits given a creamy texture by the wood aging. The wine could benefit by waiting until 2015, although it's delicious now."
Riesling,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,25.0,92.0,Flinty highlights join lemon zest freshness on a thrillingly pure and streamlined palate bursting with lemon and tangerine zest. This is taut and slender but packs a citrus punch. This is destined for hot days; it is lovely now but will also last. Some spritz enlivens the finish. Drink Now till 2020.
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Valderiz,25.0,92.0,"Pure cherry, blackberry and plum aromas are dense, toasty, minerally and smoky. Intense plum and blackberry flavors soften a bit on a loamy, lightly baked finish. Overall, this is a ripe, thoroughly drinkable RDD with tons of fruit and well-applied oak. Drink through 2020."
Riesling,US,New York,Shaw,25.0,92.0,"Demure in stature yet brooding with power, this late-release 2012 Riesling is compelling evidence of winemaker Steve Shaw's soft-spoken dynamism. Semidry in style, it's light as a feather, yet richly layered with shades of grapefruit, spice and smoke. While delicious now, it's rigidly structured still, and likely to continue to improve for many years to come."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Foxen,25.0,92.0,"This old-vines wine is really clean and light on the nose, with aromas of red apple, fresh-cut white sapote and blanched almonds. The laser-focused palate is dominated by a refreshing texture, like sipping an ice-cold martini or licking a steel knife, with sea salt and lemon peel flavors most prevalent."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Secret Spot Wines,25.0,92.0,"Made from a field blend of old vines, this is a dense wine. Full of tannins and with a strongly mineral texture (you can almost taste the dirt), it is solid with rich fruit, acidity and hints of wood aging. This powerful wine needs to age another year, so drink from 2018."
Viognier,US,California,Ampelos,25.0,92.0,"Fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, this is a subtly floral wine that flirts with apple blossom and jasmine scents on the nose. On the palate, expect creamy apricot, orange, lime and vanilla cookie flavors in a complex and layered way."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Rui Roboredo Madeira,25.0,92.0,"With a blend that's dominated by 75% Touriga Nacional, this wine is superrich, perfumed and dense with tannins as well as fresher fruit. Black berries and dark plums push through the dry core that is solid and needing to age. This is a very fine wine which will be ready to drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Altamira,25.0,92.0,"Concentrated berry and plum aromas are potent. In the mouth, this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc is massive but also abrasive and narrowing due to fierce tannins. Giant raspberry and blackberry flavors include chocolate and coffee notes. It settles on the finish but remains scratchy out the back door. Drink through 2025."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,25.0,92.0,"Succulent black plums and cherries flood the palate in this irresistibly juicy yet elegantly structured Cabernet Franc. Brisk acidity lends an electric jolt, intensified by waves of granite and green herbs. Its fresh demeanor and delicate tannins make it approachable in youth, but refinement persists."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Monsanto,25.0,92.0,"Fragrant and elegantly structured, this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo and Colorino opens with lovely aromas of pressed violet, iris, perfumed berry and baking spice. On the palate, notes of white pepper, toast, espresso and anise accent the black cherry core. Tightly knit but polished tannins give it a firm finish. Drink 2016–2022."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Graf Hardegg,25.0,92.0,"An impressive, powerful pepper- and yellow fruit-flavored wine, which has been given a considerable depth of flavor by the wood fermentation and lees aging. The balance is great. It is a wine that shows class and aging potential."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Durant,25.0,92.0,"Peach pit, apple and pear fruit flavors combine in this crisp, somewhat steely wine that has a classic elegance. Depth, length and finishing minerality make this a wine worth extra attention."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac,25.0,92.0,"Almost black in color, this medicinal, bitter chocolate flavored wine is completely dominated by wood at this stage. But it has such weight that, even though it will always be dark and dry, it is going to be powerful and impressive. Age 6–8 years."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Cristom,25.0,92.0,"This barrel-fermented estate wine is luscious and creamy, coating the palate with generous flavors of apricot, peach and melon. The concentration is impressive, as are the barrel flavors on the finish. Vanilla, coconut, caramel and lightly buttered almonds all contribute to the nuanced detail."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Michel Vattan,25.0,92.0,"One of two wines reflecting different soil types, this one comes from ground with a good amount of clay as well as chalk. That produces weight, richness and an open character. Created from nearly 50-year-old vines, there is concentration here, as well as great fruitiness. The wine is still young, still bursting with crisp fruit, so wait until 2018 to drink."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rabble,25.0,92.0,"This brand offers excellent value across the board, and this Zinfandel competes strongly with much more expensive bottlings. The balanced nose offers hearty blackberry, roasted meat, charcoal, violet and black pepper. The dark fruit and purple flowers of the palate are offset by gravelly minerality and dark chocolate flavors."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Secret Spot Wines,25.0,92.0,"Produced from a field blend of old vines in a gravity-fed winery at Quinta da Faísca, this is a concentrated and structured wine from grapes grown in the Vale de Mendiz in the heart of the Douro. Still young and still masking the black fruits with the tannins, it is slow to develop. It is rich, though, full in the mouth and likely to be a fine wine as it slowly matures. Drink from 2019."
Carignano,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Mesa,25.0,92.0,"Scents of perfumed berry, eucalyptus, chopped herb and a whiff of leather unfold in the glass. The smooth, delicious palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, freshly ground black pepper and anise alongside polished, velvety tannins."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,25.0,92.0,"From the heart of this large estate, this wine is powerful, structured and firm, with dense black plum and damson fruit. With the perfume of Aragonez and the structure of Alicante Bouschet, this fine wine still needs time to develop. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Central Otago,The Crater Rim,25.0,92.0,"Bendigo is a warm subregion of Central Otago, and this wine shows the plush, creamy texture of superripe fruit. The wine is smoky and briary, marrying black cherry and mocha notes in harmonious complexity, and ending lush and long. Drink it now and over the next few years."
Chardonnay,US,California,Wrights Station,25.0,92.0,"This is an impressive take on the unoaked style, with pithy aromas of grapefruit and quinine leading into a tropical sense of guava skins, melon rinds and white-peach flesh. The acidity is mellow but persistent on the sip, where Key lime, pink grapefruit and sharp citrus flavors shine."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Geyerhof,25.0,92.0,"Lifted lime and lemon notes appear on the shy nose, edged with soy spice. The palate follows with ripe, beautifully drawn pear fruit and even more yeasty, savory miso. Texturally this has a creamy lick and sleek midpalate concentration. The long, lovely finish brings out earthiness, pear peel and hints of lovage and chervil."
Merlot,US,California,The Winery SF,25.0,92.0,"This full-bodied wine has classy, complex aromas that combine sophisticated oak and spice notes with very generous, deep fruit flavors. The way it all comes together seamlessly on a posh but firm texture shows the winemaker's skill as well as some great grapes to start with."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Pewsey Vale,25.0,92.0,"How can one not applaud a winery that holds back some of its top Riesling for a museum release at such a reasonable price? Developed honey and cinnamon notes accent citrus fruit, adding weight and richness to the midpalate while still finishing crisp and completely dry. It's drinking well now, but should easily hold another 10 years under its screw cap."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Ovum,25.0,92.0,"Sourced from 40-year-old vines, this elegant and forceful wine deftly marries varietal perfume and tangy fruit. Lush flavors of juicy nectarine and satsuma mandarin come with a gentle hint of mint. Complex and delicious, it puts a very positive, food friendly spin on Gewürztraminer."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Baden,Franz Keller,25.0,92.0,"Whispers of fresh green herbs and lavender lend elegance and refreshment to intensely ripe yet pristine black cherry and plum flavors. The palate is succulent and juicy, marked by crisp, cutting acidity. Fine, velvety tannins cushion a long finish. Drinks well now but should hold beautifully till at least 2024."
Moscatel Roxo,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,José Maria da Fonseca,25.0,92.0,The rarely found red Moscatel grape has produced a beautiful golden-colored wine that is very much in the tradition of fortified Muscats from Setúbal. This has ripe orange and rich dried fig that are balanced by fine acidity. The wine is ready to drink.
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,25.0,92.0,"While Jurançon wines are sweet, it is the freshness that is beautiful. So there are honey and orange marmalade flavors to give the sweetness and hint at botrytis. Against that is a poised, ethereal acidity and citrus tang. Together they make a beautiful wine that can age. Drink now, but better from 2018."
Syrah,US,California,Rancho Sisquoc,25.0,92.0,"A complete package, this shows lavender, smoke, boysenberry and black raspberry aromas on the nose. Plenty of acidity appears on the palate, where black pepper, white pepper, thyme and bay leaf spice up the tight blackberry core, finishing on a slightly caramelized note."
Roussanne,US,California,Terre Rouge,25.0,92.0,"Butterscotch, butter, honey and roasted-peanut aromas lead to similar boisterous flavors in this extremely rich and full-bodied wine from Rhône-style winemaker Bill Easton. It's so ripe and luxurious that it almost tastes sweet. Aged cheese should make a great pairing."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Hyland,25.0,92.0,"From a 40-plus-year-old vineyard, this peppery wine is dry, fruity and bold. It combines peach, apple and orange fruit flavors with a lusciously full-bodied mouthfeel that's also layered and well structured. Drink now and over the next decade."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Pinto,25.0,92.0,"This is a solid and dark wine, full of black fruits and dense tannins. It has weight and richness, as well as a leather and smoke character that comes from the wood aging. A powerful wine for aging, drink from 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stadt Krems,25.0,92.0,"Crisp green apple and Conference pear scents vie for attention in this wine. The slender palate adds a backdrop of yeasty savoriness yet remains sprightly and zippy. Riper fruit adds a more sonorous tone as it finishes, feeling full of citric verve and totally appetizing."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Nelson,Neudorf,25.0,92.0,"Consistently one of New Zealand's top Chardonnay producers, Neudorf flies the standard for Nelson, almost next door to better-known Marlborough. The medium-bodied 2014 Chardonnay begins with appetizing scents of toast, oak spice and white peach. On the palate, there's a lovely combination of spice and stone fruit, then lingering citrus on the finish. Drink now–2020."
Rosé,US,California,Joyce,25.0,92.0,"This is one of the vintage's knockout rosés, thanks in part to the Grenache and Gamay grapes that make up the blend. It's pale pink in color, with supple lime pith, strawberry, chalk and melon aromas. The palate is tense with structure, its bubblegum and lemon peel flavors riding a wave of acidity that persists long into the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Beaumont,25.0,92.0,"The vineyard is in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, midway between Margaux and Saint-Julien. The wine is solid, dark and with plenty of firm tannins. At the same time, it has concentrated black fruits and a fine blend between black-currant acidity and ripe jammy fruitiness. Drink from 2020."
Greco,Italy,Southern Italy,Mastroberardino,25.0,92.0,"From the family firm that resurrected native grape Greco, this structured, elegant wine offers rich peach, apple and citrus flavors accented with intense mineral, spice and aromatic herbs. Crisp acidity beautifully balances the rich flavors. Drink 2017–2022."
Bonarda,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Durigutti,25.0,92.0,"The color is deep purple, the nose dense, alluring and hinting at mint, shoe polish, violet and blackberry. Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Laurent Gauthier,25.0,92.0,"Still very young, this is a wine with power and concentration, Dark fruits and tannins show strongly, propelling the wine to a rich future. Old vines give density while bringing out black plum and blackberry flavors. It's a wine to age, drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Esporão,25.0,92.0,"Ripe, juicy and spicy, this is already surprisingly delicious considering its solid, dark structure. Black fruits burst out, along with a sweet-and-sour character from acidity and ripe fruit flavor. It is also a good wine for aging, so drink through 2022."
Sauvignon Blanc,Australia,South Australia,Shaw and Smith,25.0,92.0,"The best Sauvignon Blanc yet from Shaw & Smith, the 2009 boasts terrifically fragrant aromas of passion fruit and pink grapefruit. It's intense and long, easily the qualitative equal of its top Kiwi cousins and better than most. Drink now–2011."
Syrah,US,Washington,Southard,25.0,92.0,"Smooth, satiny, seductive and deep, this exciting debut from a new winery shows first-class fruit sourcing and winemaking. The berry and cassis fruit flavors are ripe and polished, balanced with firm acids and hints of black olive and black tea in the tannins. Beautifully defined and balanced throughout, this is crafted for aging, but delicious already."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Cénac,25.0,92.0,"From a 16-acre vineyard, this 100% Malbec wine is properly dark in color, with dense tannins as well as ripe black plum fruits. There is a strong mineral character from the chalk in the soil, giving a powerful texture as well as structure that will allow the wine to age. This rich wine should be drunk from 2020."
Assyrtico,Greece,Santorini,Tselepos,25.0,92.0,"Lemon and slate aromas give this wine an immediate poise, but there's much more complexity on the palate. Mineral-driven but full of fresh and full-bodied citrus, pineapple and grapefruit, the wine finishes with a chalky and brisk tidiness. A truly delicious expression of a very distinctive grape."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Dumas,25.0,92.0,"A complex, ripe wine that has rich red fruits, dark cherries and a serious undertow of tannin. The name comes from what the producer calls the alchemy between wood and fruit, and certainly the balance is just right. It has structure and dense tannins along with a juicy fruitiness. The wine is now ready to drink."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Cepa 21,25.0,92.0,"Toasty, resiny blackberry aromas open this full-bodied, tannic, grabby Tinto Fino that piles on the lushness. Loamy blackberry, earth and mocha flavors are backed by a smooth, chocolaty, heady finish that's hot but not vicious. Drink through 2022."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,25.0,92.0,"The mix of fresh crisp apple and shortbread notes on the nose is a delight. The same interplay of fresh, ripe and crisp apple fruit and the more developed richer notes of autolysis continue on the light and dry palate, supported by lively fine fizzing mousse. Inherent freshness brightens the entire palate while the long shortbread-tinged aftertaste makes for a very elegant finish. Lovely. Scented notes of Golden Pearmain apple fill the nose. The palate follows in the same mellow vein while the creamy mousse accents the richness with pure lemon freshness. Shortcrust and biscuit flavours act as an aromatic backdrop. What a rounded, fresh and superbly balanced Crémant! Savor it long after the last sip has gone."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Forstreiter,24.0,92.0,"A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character. It's still young, so don't drink before 2015. Screwcap."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Sturm,24.0,92.0,"You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white. The bright, savory palate delivers tropical fruit, tangerine zest, dill, celery and mineral alongside tangy acidity. It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage."
Chardonnay,US,California,Wolff,24.0,92.0,"An oxidative style of Chardonnay seems to match the old-vine character in this bottling that is a nutty yellow in color and shows crushed hazelnuts, dried lemon, sourdough and croissant on the nose. Lemon rinds, tangerine and walnut flavors appear on the sip, which is rich and nutty but not unctuous."
Carmenère,US,New York,Osprey's Dominion,24.0,92.0,"It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Melville,24.0,92.0,"The last vintage that the Melvilles are pulling from this Los Alamos Valley vineyard, this wine shows a complex nose of lemon candy, dill and fresh oregano. There is plenty of tension and grip on the palate, thanks to the lime-pith flavors, but a show of white flowers like tuberose keeps it properly ripe."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Jardin,24.0,92.0,"Despite being barrel fermented, this attractive white manages to maintain a vivid vibrancy and freshness, with notes of fresh red apple, firm peach, pineapple core, green mango and clementine that are all infused with delicate hints of toasted oak and baking spice. Ample acidity lifts the medium-weight palate and rich melon, apple and toasted brioche flavors, leading into the long, lingering wood-spiced finish."
Dolcetto,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,24.0,92.0,"This is an exclamation point of a wine. The fruit pops with pure notes of black and red plum along with herbs and milk chocolate. It's fresh and fruit-filled, with an elegant, palate-coating texture that simply dazzles the senses."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,24.0,92.0,"This is the medium-dry Riesling from this estate vineyard, a notch lower in alcohol than the Dry bottling, and overall a bit rounder. It carries the same excellent texture, length and mix of ripe fruits, with pears and nectarines taking center stage."
Syrah,US,California,Lava Cap,24.0,92.0,"Tasty, balanced and substantial in body, this wine accents bold berry and black cherry flavors with hints of vanilla and nutmeg. The fruit flavors go deep, while fine-grained tannins frame them perfectly for excellent overall structure and harmony."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Clos Gebrat,24.0,92.0,"Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction. It feels pure and elegant, with wild berry and cherry flavors that end on a ripe, slightly sweet-tasting finish. Good for near-term drinking."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Bellevue,24.0,92.0,"This solid and dense wine has firm tannins as well as juicy fruitiness. It is dark, rich and full of black fruits that are cut with intense acidity. It needs to age further, so drink from 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Vina Robles,24.0,92.0,"Charred meat, blood, concrete and elderberry form a deep and complex nose. The fine-grained tannins deliver gamy, blackberry flavors, making for a very solid wine that's a steal of a deal."
Zinfandel,US,California,Edmeades,24.0,92.0,"There's 19% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah blended in, making for a succulent wine, with spicy, lively fruit leading the charge. There's enough acid to give it structure and balance, but not so much that the wine seems edgy or sour. Full bodied, mouthfilling, flavorful and distinctive."
Red Blend,US,California,Ancient Peaks,24.0,92.0,"There is a lot to like in this blend of 80% Syrah, 18% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, which offers deep blackberry, black cherry, star anise and pie crust on the ripe, exotically spicy nose. The palate is rich with black cherry and vanilla flavors, cut by dark spice, lingering acidity and tannic depth."
White Blend,US,Washington,Brian Carter Cellars,24.0,92.0,"2011 is another excellent vintage for this unique and aromatic blend from Brian Carter. The mix is 51% Viognier, 35% Roussanne and 14% Riesling, and it offers a riot of scents and flavors; a rotating Ferris wheel with lemon skin, beeswax, orange peel, tangerine, succulent lime and ripe pear. It's flat out luxurious, long and lissome."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Alta Maria,24.0,92.0,"A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,24.0,92.0,"Château de Mercuès has had its own vineyard since the 13th century. This latest vintage is a powerful wine, pure tannic and rich Malbec, structured and with huge black fruits. The wine has weight, solid tannins and an excellent potential. Drink from 2017–2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,24.0,92.0,"This offers a hint of honey in the nose, then moves into a fresh palate loaded with a full range of yellow fruits. The acidity is spot on, and a suggestion of wet cement adds a hint of mineral to the lengthy finish. Drink now through 2024."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,René Muré,24.0,92.0,"Ripe, yellow pear, stone and earth are united by a zesty grapefruit perfume. The streak of purity at the center of this is invigorating, with an enlivening backbone of tinkling acidity. This bottling does justice to a difficult vintage—and is all the more alluring for it. Something racy and pure at the core makes you want to delve deeply into this wine."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,US,California,Buttonwood,24.0,92.0,"The 33% Semillion shows strongly in this Bordeaux-style blend, with the rest Sauvignon Blanc. Toasted Marcona almonds, preserved lemons, dried limes, iodine and walnut oil greet the nose. The nut-oil character is laced throughout the palate, with dried yellow fruits and a touch of earthiness. It's fresh yet creamy, and perfect for a wide range of cheeses."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weixelbaum,24.0,92.0,"This is a big, fruity wine that has a dense texture and intense white fruit and peach fruit flavors. It's an impressive, rich wine, worth aging for 2–3 years. Screwcap."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Verrazzano,24.0,92.0,"This vibrant Chianti Classico has ripe strawberry and raspberry aromas with hints of violet. The palate shows delicious red cherry layered with white pepper and a hint of chocolate, all in a fresh and supple style."
Albariño,US,California,Stephen Ross,24.0,92.0,"There is an impressively persistent stony quality to the nose and palate of this bottling. On the nose, that takes the form of a rainy cement note, which, along with lime-skin and pith scents, give fresh tension to the broad peach and pear aromas. On the palate, it's all about grippy texture, which holds up green apple, underrripe pluot and lime-wedge flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lusso Della Terra,24.0,92.0,"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar. The clonal selection shines, given partial barrel-fermentation, partial stainless steel, all aged in mostly neutral French oak. Honeysuckle aromas jump from the glass, followed by viscous, juicy tropical elements of mango and lychee. It finishes dry and lemony."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Seven of Hearts,24.0,92.0,"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory."
Red Blend,US,California,Eruption,24.0,92.0,"This full-bodied wine packs a lot of punch in terms of mouthfeel and flavor. The color is extremely dark, and the flavors resemble dark chocolate, black cherries and baking spices. It is dry in style, with lip-smacking, nicely astringent tannins that counterbalance all that richness."
Syrah,US,California,La Clarine Farm,24.0,92.0,"Suma Kaw has been a vaunted vineyard source for some of the best Syrah in the Foothills. Opening with a gust of peppercorn and an herbal thread of pine, this Syrah dances on the edge of being overwhelming, with intense tannins weaving between the flavors of bright red fruit and smoky meat. It's enjoyable now, and will drink well in several years, too."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Celler Piñol,24.0,92.0,"Complex aromas of coffee, black pepper and wild herbs like rosemary and thyme get this five-grape blend off to a fine start. A flush, lush yet balanced palate continues the momentum, while excellent flavors of ripe blackberry, meaty plum and savory spices finish with interesting notes of salty leather and licorice. Drink through 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Herdade do Rocim,24.0,92.0,"From the Vieira family's Lisboa vineyard, this blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Syrah is well balanced, offering elegant black fruits and delicious acidity. The structure is restrained and finely wrought. Drink the wine now."
Red Blend,US,California,Cottonwood Canyon,24.0,92.0,"This Pinot Noir-Syrah blend opens up with aromas of cherry compote, red currant, pencil shavings and roasted beets. It's extremely silky on the palate, with purple fruit, even blueberries present. The alcohol is not out of balance, thanks to a touch of bitterness."
Zinfandel,US,California,Newsome-Harlow,24.0,92.0,"Newsome-Harlow's largest bottling, the Calaveras County is a delicious deal at $24, steeped in ebullient cherry and raspberry high tones, juicy yet entirely elegant. A classic California Zin in all the best senses, it offers black pepper, muted chocolate and softly layered structure."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,24.0,92.0,"This is a block selection from the principal estate vineyard. At first flavors of soda cracker, with a saline edge, fill the palate. Then apple, pear and melon fruit come in, with excellent concentration and refreshing acidity."
G-S-M,US,California,Helwig,24.0,92.0,"A tasty array of delicious fruit flavors merges with meaty, savory, smoky nuances in this full-bodied, bold-tasting and very enjoyable wine. It smells like blackberries, blueberries and oak smoke, and tastes more wild and beefy until a wave of fruit envelops the finish. It shows interesting complexity along with lip-smacking allure."
Viognier,US,California,Skinner,24.0,92.0,"A bright ripe fruit aroma like pineapple and ripe, luxurious fig, vanilla and almond flavors combine for an explosion of delicious power on the palate. This full-bodied wine has lots of depth and breadth in texture, plus a long, lingering finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Buchegger,24.0,92.0,"It is within a firm frame of lime and pale lemon zest on a slender but concentrated body that aromas of green fern, peppery watercress and mouth-watering white grapefruit pulp express themselves. This is lip-smacking and provides total, convincing and linear refreshment."
Assyrtico,Greece,Santorini,Domaine Sigalas,24.0,92.0,"Sigalas sets the bar high for Assyrtiko as usual. This 2010 is a balance of rounded citrus, crisp sea salt and sparkling minerality. Delicious with grilled fish, fruit or alone on a hot day, this is an elegant gem of a white that represents some of the best of Greek wine offered today."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,24.0,92.0,"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Thermenregion,Loimer,24.0,92.0,"A blend of local grapes (Zierfandler and Rotgipfler) this is impressive. Rich, perfumed, its fragrant fruits a medley of mulberry, pear and spiced apple. The acidity cuts right through, giving a wine that is both very ripe, balanced and finely textured. Screwcap."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,24.0,92.0,"Unusual rose petal perfume hovers above the apple-scented nose. The palate is dry but textured and open, broad but fluid and poised. There is a seam of taut, bright and pure lemon acidity that frames everything neatly and which makes this totally appetizing and moreish in all its fruitfulness."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Grey Wolf Cellars,24.0,92.0,"Very inviting aromas of lemon curd, buttercream, white peach and pear blossom prove quite ripe but far from overdone on this blend of 40% Roussanne, 40% Marsanne and 20% Viognier. There is thinly focused but prevalent acidity to the sip, where peaches, lemon and cream flavos thrive. A well balanced and rich white Rhône blend, which is harder to pull off than it sounds."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Pratsch,24.0,92.0,"An aroma of fresh, green Bartlett-pear peel comes first, then the riper notion of pear compote, with a grippy, lime-zest accent and a dash of pepper. Waves of flavor unfold on the tongue and give exquisite length. It has ample mileage to develop; enjoy it now while primary and zippy or wait for mellowed richness later. Either way, it belongs on the table. Drink 2014–2020."
Primitivo,US,California,Jaxon Keys,24.0,92.0,"In this wine, a distinct and delicious blackberry-jam aroma is backed up by concentrated and pure fruit flavors. But the balance is good and dry, and the wine has a mouth-filling texture buoyed by fine-grained tannins and full body. This is a wonderful example of a flavor-packed but sophisticated dinner wine from this varietal."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Minho,Quinta de Soalheiro,24.0,92.0,"This is an impressive concentrated wine. Now with a couple of years of aging, it has lost its baby acidity and developed a leaner more structured character. That goes with the apple and citrus fruitiness to give the wine a balanced mature character. It is ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Pence Ranch,24.0,92.0,"There are judicious hints of turned forest floor and barnyard funk on the nose of this wine from just east of the Sta. Rita Hills, with a licorice and wild berry fruit backbone. A lemon brightness highlights the palate, along with tobacco, black olives and a pronounced bitterness. The strong acidity will drive an evolution, so drink 2018–2030."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Estampa,24.0,92.0,"This smooth and inviting blend is impressive for the price. With mildly herbal Carmenère-driven aromas of olive and peppery spice, and then a deep and structured palate feel, Gold is golden. Look for a ton of ripe plum and berry flavor touched up by oak, chocolate and pepper accents. On the finish, it's spicy, peppery, smooth and complete. Drink now–2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Ochagavia,24.0,92.0,"Crisp, spicy aromas of red fruits matched against oregano, basil and olive notes give this Cabernet a lot of character and points of interest. The palate is tight and well structured, while dark berry, spice, herb and chocolate flavors flow onto a toasty, minty, warm and tannic finish. This is a bit aggressive now; give it two years and drink through 2019."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Pichler-Krutzler,24.0,92.0,"While the softer scent of green Conference pears wraps around the nose, the palate also takes in subtle earth and adds pliable, almost soft notes of apricot and yellow plum to a stony, poised and statuesque background. This is lovely and fresh now but sure to develop. Drink anytime now until 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Willi Haag,24.0,92.0,"This wine's unassuming nose belies the thrilling depth of juicy, sweet white peach, tangerine and quince flavors that burst on the palate. Luminous fruit and spine tingling acidity collide, hinged by a kick of phenolic bitterness that lingers on the finish."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Brooks,24.0,92.0,"Lovely aromatics conjure up rose petals, a dash of body powder and ripe citrus. The fruit is very ripe, with almost a candy character, and there's a sensation of powdered sugar. But despite the almost 14g/L residual sugar, it's more sweet/tart than syrupy, keeping it sappy and refreshing."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,24.0,92.0,"Packed with juicy fruit flavors that recall a tart lemon drop or limoncello cocktail, this low-alcohol beauty retains its powerful acidity even as a dollop of residual sugar softens it. It's full and round, with both power and precision."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Pinto,24.0,92.0,"Lisboa's coastal climate keeps this wine fresh and with good acidity despite its richness. Wood aging has smoothed the natural tannins of the fruit, yileding a concentrated wine with a deep, solid base that could still benefit from some aging."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Rui Roboredo Madeira,24.0,92.0,"A field blend dominated by old-vine Touriga Nacional, this is a richly endowed wood-aged wine. It is dark and concentrated, packed with juicy black fruits and acidity. The tannins support the ripe fruitiness. Drink this generous wine from 2018."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,24.0,92.0,"This biodynamic estate produces some very fine wines, expressive of their soil types. This still-young wine from volcanic rock is ripe while also intensely structured. It has the potential for great fruitiness while keeping this structure. Drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Oak Farm,24.0,92.0,"Wonderful richness, depth and concentration make this full-bodied wine a standout. Rich berry and cherry flavors are densely packed within a velvety viscous texture that soothes the palate and clings to the sides of the mouth. A long finish completes the picture."
Malbec,US,California,Chacewater,24.0,92.0,"Deep color, firm tannins and a fine-grained texture set this wine apart. It smells fresh and sophisticated, with bright cranberry and rich black-cherry notes shaded by cinnamon and nutmeg. This should stand up to the richest rack of lamb and age well, too. It's tempting to drink now, but should improve through at least 2018."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine du Deffends,24.0,92.0,"This complete wine has all the elements of delicious rosé right in place. It is fresh and fruity, crisply mineral and with a lively acidity. The texture makes it a good food wine. It comes from vineyards that are certified organic. Drink now."
Malbec-Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,24.0,92.0,"While there are powerful tannins at work here, this wine is mainly full of rich black fruits that have a juicy side from the acidity. The addition of Tannat brings even more tannin to the wine while also giving it density and longevity. Drink from 2019. The wine comes from a long-time wine family that tended the few remaining Malbec grapes that survived phylloxera of late 1800s. Alain Gayraud is the current owner."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,24.0,92.0,"Succulent and leesy, it blends juice from five different sites, including the King Estate vineyard. Soaked in minerals and alive with pretty fruit flavors of citrus, pink grapefruit and Key lime, this reserve-level bottling is one of several limited offerings by the leader in Oregon Pinot Gris."
Viognier,US,California,Lawer,24.0,92.0,"This is a pretty wine, resplendent in jasmine and honeysuckle, with a light-bodied, integrated approach to highlighting fresh layers of apricot and peach. The viscosity is just right, focused and restrained, while the finish puts an exclamation point to the freshness of fruit."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Willowbrook,24.0,92.0,"This light-bodied, surprisingly affordable wine surprises in its lightness of color and texture, its character driven by high-strung elements of pomegranate and tangerine. On the more savory side, expect nuances of earthy mint, bay leaf and white pepper."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Penner-Ash,24.0,92.0,"This tastes dry, though the 12.5 g/L residual sugar does round off the mouthfeel. Powerful, juicy fruit flavors of lemon pith, orange peel, pink grapefruit and white peach abound, with a touch of honey in the finish. Two-thirds was sourced from the excellent Hyland Vineyard."
Carricante,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Planeta,24.0,92.0,"Elegant and structured, this opens with delicate aromas of Spanish broom, pear and Mediterranean herb. The linear, vibrant palate delivers juicy green apple, creamy pear and citrus alongside an energizing mineral and crisp acidity. This will continue to develop.  Drink through 2020."
Malbec-Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,24.0,92.0,"Aged in wood for 14 months, this dense wine is still in its early stages. Firm tannins dominate this blend, which has 10% Tannat along with Malbec. Ripe black fruits are developing to give a wine that will have great concentration and intense juicy black plum fruits. Drink from 2019."
Red Blend,Spain,Spanish Islands,Plumia,24.0,92.0,"Earthy aromas of light herbs, tobacco and cherry announce a round, jammy palate that's more lush and easy than tight and structured. This Syrah-based blend includes Garnacha and Monastrell, and it tastes of blackberry, baked plum and herbs. The finish is a bit wide and soft, so drink now."
Spätburgunder,Germany,Baden,Ziereisen,24.0,92.0,"Elegance abounds throughout this concentrated, yet crisp, vivacious Spätburgunder (German for Pinot Noir). Juicy streaks of black plum and cherry are accented by violet, smoke and granite. Soft, powdery tannins lend plushness to a long, lingering finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,24.0,92.0,"The wine is crisp, packed with grapefruit flavors and with a tight texture that suggests it could age. A tang and a steely acidity comes in behind the fruit and offers an austere aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Merlot,France,Bordeaux,Château Mayne Vieil,24.0,92.0,"This pure Merlot wine from Mayne-Vieil is ripe and rich. Full of jammy blackberry and black plum, it is a generous wine, enveloping the tannins in a cushioned embrace. It is going to develop into a delicious wine. Drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Bodkin,24.0,92.0,"Co-fermented with 10% Petite Sirah, this red certainly impresses. With a fruity entry, it meets a leathery tightness on the midpalate, its mix of cherry and orange confounding expectations of darker expression from the varieties with its rose-tinged aromas. Spicy pepper rounds out the finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,24.0,92.0,"Clean, slender poise and quiet citrus conviction give this wonderfully light wine its chief character. There is gentle but pure lemon freshness at the very core of this, radiating weightless brightness. This leaves you thoroughly refreshed. With its energy and drive this wine means that conversation will be enlivened rather than dampened."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,24.0,92.0,"This rich, wood-aged blend dominated by Viosinho is spicy with a ripe toastiness. The acidity highlights this impressively stylish wine through the tangy, fruit finish. Drink after 2018."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Navarro,24.0,92.0,"The packaging seems a little old school, but the wine inside the bottle more than holds its own. The nose is pure and rich, like molasses. And there are no weaknesses in the mouth, where chocolate, brown sugar and prune flavors dominate. Broad through the finish, but never clumsy. An excellent sweet wine from Spain."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Baiocchi Wines,24.0,92.0,"This wonderful and youthful wine shows how the Rhône varieties blend so well. It tastes as if the Grenache gives ripe fruit and the Syrah adds power and tannins. It's a big wine, with ample grippy texture, full body and good potential for aging through at least 2019."
Rosé,US,California,Kokomo,24.0,92.0,"Fragrantly floral, this stunner offers delightful bursts of lemon, grapefruit and pomelo, as well as succulent raspberry. The acidity is persistent and tangy. Light-bodied and yet complex, it's easy to love and enjoy being just right for the table, beach blanket or kayak."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sobon Estate,24.0,92.0,"Light hints of licorice and clove dance around lusciously ripe fruit flavors in this big, layered and almost monumental wine. The fruit is darker than usual, like black plum and currant, while the thick yet fine tannins massage the mouth as you sip and pull all that gorgeous fruit through the lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Thermenregion,Heinrich Hartl,24.0,92.0,"A promising touch of reduction still plays on the nose, riding above ripe notions of redcurrant and red cherry. The palate is ripe, mellow and smooth, showing rounded berry notes and a gentle structure supported by spicy freshness. Oak is beautifully integrated and nothing is overdone. The ripeness of the vintage is evident, but it is on the finish that this shows its true colors: a good structure and lasting freshness."
Viognier,US,California,Miraflores,24.0,92.0,"Rich in texture and full of flavor, this is a generous, mouth-filling wine that layers subtle spice and fruit and seems to melt on the palate. Matured for 12 months on the lees, it's concentrated, creamy and complex, from its fresh-baked bread and nutmeg aromas to its lemon cream flavors to its lingering, vanilla-laced finish."
Chardonnay,France,Alsace,Domaine Saint-Rémy,24.0,92.0,"The reticent nose gives almost nothing away but the palate fills with gentle flavors of shortbread and apple peel, of slightly bitter grapefruit zest and of sprays of citrussy freshness dispersed by a lively, fine-fizzing mousse. This Crémant is light and dry, restrained and subtle. The finish is elegant and very clean-cut."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Fiddletown Cellars,24.0,92.0,"Built for the long haul, this full-bodied and very firmly textured wine is impressive to taste now but will drink best after 2023. Beguiling aromas touch on sweet spices, grilled meat, black pepper, blackberries and wood smoke. Concentrated, layered fruit flavors seem to coat the palate and linger on the finish."
Sangiovese,US,California,Rosa d'Oro,24.0,92.0,"A true Sangiovese with texture, structure and tannin. Ample fruit and savory components begin in the aroma and spread out on the palate. It tastes dry, medium-bodied and mouthwatering in a way that is flavorful yet holds a bit of itself in reserve. Made from 77% Amador County grapes, with the rest from Yolo and Lake. Enjoy through 2017."
Merlot,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Lapostolle,24.0,92.0,"Plum, blackberry and boysenberry aromas show nuances of citrus peel and rubber band. On the palate, this is tight, mildly tannic and slightly astringent due to firm tannins. A mix of ripe blackberry and cassis flavors come with chocolaty oak in front of a hard-pushing, lightly herbal finish. Drink through 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Brooks,24.0,92.0,"From 30-year-old vines, this lively and thoroughly delightful wine pushes a swath of honey down the core. It's smooth and supple, with bright candied-citrus flavors. You'll find a lick of butterscotch also, as the wine has terrific penetration and length. It's perfect for solo sipping, slightly chilled."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Trisaetum,24.0,92.0,"Yet another fruit-powered, lip-smacking Riesling from Trisaetum, this brings a basket of yellow apples, tart limes, pears and a slice of pink grapefruit into perfect harmony. Leesy, textural, long and utterly refreshing, it finishes with a nice kick of bracing acidity."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Stéphane Aviron,24.0,92.0,"From a family-owned cru vineyard. Stéphane Aviron has produced an impressive, ripe and dense wine. It has great swathes of black fruit and generous acidity. The tannins, still young, are a background to this delicious fruitiness. Drink from 2020."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,René Muré,24.0,92.0,"Earth and roses, lemon zest and orange flesh: these are the contrasts of this refreshing, toned but textured Gewurztraminer that shows the full weight of its rose perfume on the palate. Its dryness underlines earth rather than fruit, but has no less charm for that. On the contrary: the lingering aftertaste leaves a lasting impression."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Eisenberg,Uwe Schiefer,24.0,92.0,"Delicious blueberry, plum and cinnamon notes are still shy on the nose. The palate also holds them tight with pervading, lively freshness and a very slight spritz. White pepper spice colors the edges, making for an exciting, concentrated but light-footed wine that has rusticity and elegance in equal measure. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink now–2025."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Tegernseerhof,24.0,92.0,"A touch of lemon zest, a hint of lime, a suspicion of yeast: the nose of this wine is fresh and restrained. Light but juicy, the body ripples with refreshing ease across the tongue. It's a slender, pure and uplifting wine with zestiness and enduring, almost-weightless freshness."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,L'Amandine,24.0,92.0,"It's fading a bit at the rim, but it's a treat to know that mature releases like this are in the market. Age has mellowed its tannins to silky smoothness, while the aromas and flavors resemble thyme blossoms, cherries and leather. Hints of herbal tea and mocha linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2022."
Malbec-Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,24.0,92.0,"The combination of two naturally tannic grapes has inevitably produced a tannic wine. But the ripe layer of rich black fruits acts as a foil to the density of the wine and gives it both balance and a good future. This is a serious wine that needs to age, so drink from 2020."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Barrage Cellars,24.0,92.0,"The Conner Lee Vineyard supplies the fruit—it's the source of some of Washington's finest Chardonnays. Barrel fermented, it's super concentrated and displays a dense mix of fruit and barrel flavors, apples and peaches, toasted almonds and buttered toast. Good length and that extra yum factor make this a top pick."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château des Jacques,24.0,92.0,"Château des Jacques, owned by Burgundy producer Louis Jadot, makes serious wines, such as this Morgon. It's powerful and rich, full of solid black cherry flavors and a strongly mineral structure from granite soil. It's a complex wine that needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Gewürztraminer,Austria,Burgenland,Hafner Kosher,24.0,92.0,"The rich scent of dark honey is immediately cut by the heady lift of something that recalls the Mediterranean—juniper, conifers and crushed citrus leaves. The palate is a celebration of candied citrus—orange, lemon and grapefruit. Rich and deliciously tart at the same time."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Valdubón,24.0,92.0,"Fully ripe aromas of blackberry, raisin, vanilla and wood grain set up a fleshy, bold palate that's tannic, but not tough or impermeable. Savory oak and ripe berry fruit flavors finish chewy and dense, with moderate complexity. Drink through 2025."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Kerloo,24.0,92.0,"This wine is a blend of 54% Grenache (Upland), 38% Mourvèdre (Boushey) and 8% Syrah (Blue Mountain). It shows pure aromas of green herbs, violets, raspberry, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit. The flavors are pretty, plump and pure, putting a focus on texture, with fruit flavors stretching out on the finish and an orange-peel note running throughout."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Rizzi,24.0,92.0,"This young Nebbiolo has aromas of wild strawberry, rose petal, dark baking spice and a whiff of new leather. The bright palate offers juicy red cherry, raspberry, Alpine herb and white pepper. Firm, refined tannins and vibrant acidity provide balance and structure."
Zinfandel,US,California,Uvaggio,24.0,92.0,"This is a bold, very ripe and full-bodied wine that has a good frame of firm tannins and acidity to give it an appetizing texture. While packed with plump, almost sweet flavors like blackberry jam, it is nicely dry and well balanced, leading to a lingering finish that last for 30 seconds."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,24.0,92.0,"Spiced, baked apple constitutes the main aroma on nose and palate: ripe but tart baked fruit scented with edges of cinnamon and citrus. This brims with fruit and lemony brightness on a citrus-focussed, dry palate of concentration and earthy poise. Lasting and delicious. Drink 2016–2020."
Chardonnay,France,France Other,Domaine Labet,24.0,92.0,"Fruity and fragrant, this rich and complex wine also has a strong sense of acidity. Putting it all together, the wine has weight, aging potential and a fine, zesty, tight texture. It needs to age, so drink this fascinating wine from 2016."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Emilio Moro,24.0,92.0,"Dark aromas of molasses, maple syrup, toast, char and blackberry are rich and ripe. This is intense and firm on the palate, with hard-pounding tannins absorbed by a full, receptive body. Baked blackberry, cassis and loamy flavors finish ripe, tannic, pure and typical of excellent Tinto Fino from Ribera del Duero. Drink through 2021."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,24.0,92.0,"One of a pair of wines that comes from specific soil types. This impressive wine, from granite soil, is strongly mineral while also having some great fruit. Apples, pears and green plums all make their presence felt in this wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Rubino Estates Winery,24.0,92.0,"Ah, subtlety and richness come together in this delicious, layered and creamy-textured wine. It has light aromas of marzipan and pear, more fully developed vanilla, nutmeg and pear tart flavors and a luscious mouthfeel that helps extend the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Pence Ranch,24.0,92.0,"Shy at first on the nose, this wine from just east of the Sta. Rita Hills boundary winds up offering a very pretty if delicate nose of lime, salt and a touch of popcorn hidden in the background. It's high-toned and bright on the palate, with limestone, gray slate and lime-peel flavors, quite refreshing with each sip."
Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Heinrich Hartl,24.0,92.0,"A touch of honeysuckle works its way through the peachy, lemony nose of this indigenous Austrian. The palate brings out peach and a perfumed, rose-scented phenolic edge. Although the texture is rounded, the palate is fresh and firm. Ripeness and exuberance are coralled into lively and very appetizing freshness."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Di Bruno,24.0,92.0,"There's the ever-so-slight touch of pink to the glass in this bottling by Bruno D'Alfonso, who packs strong and fresh aromas of cider apples, chalk, tangerine zest, pear flesh and light jasmine on the nose. There is tons of energy on the palate, tightening up before unleashing poached Asian pear, lime spritzer and red apple flavors."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Abelis Carthago,24.0,92.0,"Full, dark aromas of varied black fruits set up a rich, chewy palate that's stern but not too hard. Flavors of black fruits and oaky spice are meaty as a whole, while the finish is lush, round and only slightly gripping. This Toro amounts to a great value. Drink through 2020."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,24.0,92.0,"Sourced 60% from the King Estate Vineyard and 40% from the Pfeiffer Vineyards, this sports lovely scents of melon, grapefruit and pear, with accents of sweet grain. Flavors follow in lockstep, with the juicy grapefruit taking the lead, along with tongue-tickling acids."
White Blend,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Franz Haas,24.0,92.0,"This wine, which takes the family name of Franz Haas's wife, is an extraordinary blend of 50% Riesling, 20% Chardonnay, 20% Traminer and 10% Sauvignon Blanc. And yet these disparate elements come together into a harmonious, ripe wine, with just a hint of toast from the barrel-fermented Chardonnay. It is powerful, rich and complex."
Mencía,Spain,Galicia,Regina Viarum,24.0,92.0,"Mossy earthy black-fruit aromas open this powerful laser-focused Mencía. Eschewing the ligh floral style that's common in Ribeira Sacra, this is ripped and intense. Toasty spicy blackberry and plum flavors show a note of lemony oak. The finish is like a spice cabinet of clove, mint, pepper, etc. Drink through 2025."
Sémillon,Australia,New South Wales,Silkman,24.0,92.0,"Scents of wet stone, paraffin and citrus ease into flavors of lemon, melon and tea on the palate. This is light in body and silky in feel, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink it now or age it up to 10 years, maybe even longer."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,The Four Graces,24.0,92.0,"This is a thrilling example of just how good Oregon Pinot Blanc can be. Lush and captivating flavors conjure up fresh-baked apple pie, along with citrus, melon and a streak of creamy vanilla. The depth and persistence are exceptional."
Port,Portugal,Port,Fonseca,24.0,92.0,"This is a finely perfumed wine that has plenty of juicy black currant flavors. Fresh initially, it then develops ripe tannins and a character that emphasizes fruit and a dense aftertaste. It is ready to drink, although because it is unfiltered it will also age well and can be drunk until 2020."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Roederer Estate,23.0,92.0,"Thickly moussed, Roederer's Brut, 60% Chardonnay blended with 40% Pinot Noir, aged two years on yeast is affordable and luxurious. A gorgeous, very dry sparkling wine with aromatics of honey, raisin, apple and pear, it is rich and soft and offers both depth and length. It's an ideal marriage of bright acidity and ripe fruit character."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,23.0,92.0,"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Cellers Sant Rafel,23.0,92.0,"A winner given its quality-to-price quotient. This smells earthy, dark and harmonious, with black plum and berry aromas leading the charge. It feels racy, juicy and full, with giant raspberry, plum, vanilla, tobacco and licorice flavors. It's textured on the finish, with bright, lasting flavors. Drink now."
Marsanne,Australia,Victoria,Tahbilk,23.0,92.0,"Tasted at their regular release date less than a year after the vintage, the Tahbilk Marsannes aren't terribly expressive. The key is bottle age, and this Museum Release has it. Lemon custard and thyme are tinged with hints of toast and marmalade in this medium-bodied white. A touch of creaminess on the midpalate extends through a long finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Sérilhan,23.0,92.0,"This firmly tannic wine, characteristic of Saint-Estèphe, is very dry. Underneath the dryness, there is a delicious, opulent juiciness that brings out black currant and plum flavors. It's obviously a wine for the long haul; keep for at least six years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,23.0,92.0,"A wonderfully breezy, citrusy scent promises far fuller expression in the future. The palate is tightly coiled too, but already vibrates with pepper and herbal spice. Riper notions of yellow plums creep onto the palate but the spiciness and citrus zest remain, making for a truly long, lip-smacking finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Testarossa,23.0,92.0,"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuvée from Monterey County rivals their best efforts. There is nuttiness, brioche and slightly sour orange on the nose, followed by a very soft mouthfeel, with flavors of pound cake, vanilla cookie, peach cobbler and candied grapefruit."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Chantegrive,23.0,92.0,"The top white wine from Chantegrive, this is a smoothly wood-aged wine. However it doesn't lose sight of deliciously fresh, herbaceous fruits which come through crisply. That makes the resulting balance immediately appealing, acidity and spice coming together well. Worth aging for 2–3 years."
Riesling,New Zealand,Central Otago,Felton Road,23.0,92.0,"This powerful expression of Riesling blends floral aromas with scents of lime, pineapple and crushed stone, then finishes with great length and intensity. The strident citrus and mineral notes seem to echo on the palate, filling the mouth with their characterful flavors."
Pinot Gris,New Zealand,Central Otago,Carrick,23.0,92.0,"This is slightly smoky on the nose, offering scents of toasted almonds that neatly accent pear and kumquat aromas. It's richly textured on the palate, where the pear and almond notes pick up zesty citrus overtones that allow them to finish clean and fresh. Drink now."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Zull,23.0,92.0,There is impressive balance here—rich apple and pear flavors with a tang of minerality. It is smooth and concentrated on the one hand and edgy and nervy on the other. Screwcap.
Riesling,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,23.0,92.0,"An intriguing nose of Comice pear, menthol and lemon oil creates a delicious aromatic hit. The palate is supertight and zesty. Citrus is the main focus along the linear palate that is fringed by the same aromatic top-notes as the nose. Beautiful now the wine has the verve and stuffing to mature beautifully. Drink now through 2020."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Fabre Montmayou,23.0,92.0,"Opaque to the eye, this is rich, heady and full of inky blackberry aromas and notes of graphite, balsam wood, tobacco and coconut. A lush, mile-deep palate offers chocolaty flavors of blackberry, roasted meat and salt. Ripe black-fruit flavors dominate a lush finish. Drink through 2020."
Rosé,France,Provence,M. Chapoutier,23.0,92.0,"Making the best use of the privileged land around Mount Sainte-Victoire, this is a rich full-flavored wine. Produced by the major Rhône house of Chapoutier, it has a fine pedigree. That heritage leads to rich fruit that is scintillating with acidity and lifted by a light herbal edge. The wine will be ready to drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,23.0,92.0,"Riper notions of yellow plum and melon mingle with Grüner's attractive freshness, here expressed by lemon and lime zest flavors. The palate adds extra verve with a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge. This is a taut, clean, super-fruited textbook example of freshness with tons of verve."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Chesebro,23.0,92.0,"Aromas of strawberries and olallieberries seasoned with mace, allspice and savory woods greet the nose on this blend of Syrah and Grenache by Mark Chesebro, former winemaker for Bernardus. The palate shows black cherry, cedar and tobacco, proving quite flavorful, structured by sticky tannins and a striking acidity."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Antinori,23.0,92.0,"A classically powerful Riserva from Antinori, produced from the three family estates at Tignanello, Pèppoli and Badia a Passignano. Aromas of violets and cherries are followed by tobacco and spice flavors from the wood, as well as concentrated black fruits. Rich and full-bodied, it should age well over the next 10 years."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot,23.0,92.0,"This wine is ripe, with a warm, yellow fruit character. It is bright and poised, elegant and sophisticated. Acidity shoots through the richness, bringing a strong citrus element. Sunny in character, it will still age; drink from late 2016."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,23.0,92.0,"This top wine from Lamartine is a fine, solid expression of the firm nature of young Malbec. It has dark, dense black fruits layered behind the dry, tight tannins. With this concentration, this is a wine that needs to age. Leave until 2020."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Barone di Villagrande,23.0,92.0,"Very pretty aromas suggest lychee, Spanish broom, Mediterranean brush and a balsamic sensation. The linear palate delivers nectarine, creamy green apple and savory herb while edgy acidity generates a crisp, clean finish. It closes on an energized mineral note."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Bel Air,23.0,92.0,"In this rich, full wine, impressive fruits and structure work together. It feels weighty, concentrated and tannic while also having layers of juicy ripe black currant fruits. Give this solid wine several years and don't drink before 2018."
Syrah,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Montes,23.0,92.0,"Deep purple in color, this cool-vintage Syrah excels via smooth cherry, cassis, cedar and charcoal aromas. A full-bodied palate is balanced by firm acidity, while plum, berry, cassis and chocolate flavors finish in harmony. Drink through 2020."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Paul Beaudet,23.0,92.0,"The rare ripeness of the 2009 vintage is shown in the high alcohol, for Beaujolais at least, of this wine. Not that it shows, except in weight. The acidity is right there along with ripe plums. An ageworthy, finely concentrated wine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Castello d'Alba,23.0,92.0,"Rui Madeira's flagship red is a formidable, powerful wine. It has intense tannins that are surrounded by dark fruits and rich, juicy acidity. The core is dry, concentrated and dense, and the wood aging shows against the background of ripe fruits, promising good aging potential. Drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Rocim,23.0,92.0,"This estate wine is seriously structured, with tones of dried herbs alongside richer elements of dense tannins and ripe black fruits. A bright acid backbone maintains a fresh and lively character. It might be best to lay down this selection for further integration."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Gundlach Bundschu,23.0,92.0,"An entirely varietal wine, aged in a majority of stainless steel, this smoothly textured experience begins in peach and apricot with balanced acidity, dry as a bone. It entices with rounded creaminess and inviting floral and lemon highlights."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Taillan,23.0,92.0,"Leaving Bordeaux for the Médoc, this is the first estate along the road. The wine is structured and firm, with some solid tannins as well as generous blackberry fruit. The wood aging and spice balance the blueberry and blackberry fruits. The wine should age well; drink from 2021."
Syrah,Chile,Marchigue,Polkura,23.0,92.0,"Composed, cool aromas of marzipan, vanilla, boysenberry and cassis are touched up by controlled oak. This feels cushioned but with pop and tannic grab. Dark peppery herbal black-fruit flavors come with a chocolaty component, while this tastes of herbs and chocolate cake on a bold oaky finish. Drink through 2022."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Masies d'Avinyo,23.0,92.0,"For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,23.0,92.0,"This is a rich, smooth, vanilla-flavored wine that is impressively ripe while keeping all its freshness. It has a sense of concentration, with ripe strawberry and red cherry fruits and enough structure to allow it to age. Drink from 2015."
Rosé,France,Provence,Estandon,23.0,92.0,"After an extra year's aging, this wine's richness is very apparent. It may have lost immediate freshness but it has gained in ripe fruits, in texture and in depth. It's a complex wine worth pairing with food."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine les Fines Graves,23.0,92.0,"This is a serious, complex cru wine from Jacky Janodet. It is full of structured tannins and rich black fruits. It is a wine that will age with its dry core and layers of acidity. There is a brighter element to this impressive wine that keeps the aftertaste juicy and crisp. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Chatelain,23.0,92.0,"From old vines and only produced in top vintages, this ripe perfumed wine is impressive. Rich with tropical fruits, layers of vanilla and acidity, it is full, up-front and packed with concentrated flavors and textures. Like many wines from this appellation, it can age and will be better from 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,23.0,92.0,"If there is any criticism to be made of this wine, it might be that it is just too fruity. Waves of honey and tropical fruit coat the mouth, wonderfully balanced by zesty acidity, and while it is sweet and lush it never seems cloying or heavy. Delicious now–2015, at least."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Roubine,23.0,92.0,"Bright and fruity, this crisp and fresh wine is full of lively red currants and berries cut with acidity and a tangy, orange peel texture. This is a great summer rosé."
Friulano,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Scubla,23.0,92.0,"Stunning and sophisticated, it opens with intense aromas of stone fruit, tomato vine, pear and nut.

Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,23.0,92.0,"Deep and rich in this landmark Oregon vintage, this Pinot Blanc abounds with flavors of buttered pears, toast and vanilla custard. The texture and balance are spot-on, and the wine is flat-out delicious."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,Contrade di Taurasi - Lonardo,23.0,92.0,"Intensely perfumed, this offers enticing scents of wild red berry, rose, violet and exotic spice.

Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,WillaKenzie Estate,23.0,92.0,"Perfectly differentiated from the winery's equally excellent Pinot Blanc, this is a bit fleshier, with fresh flavors of apple and pear. The texture, mouthfeel and mineral-drenched acids all flow into a mouthwatering finish."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Meerlust,23.0,92.0,"This wine shows superb balance between ripe fruit tones, attractive oak influence and natural freshness. It leads with scents of lightly toasted nuts, orange cream, freshly dried grass and yellow flowers. The medium-weight palate offers decadent flavors of toasted apple skin and brioche, with orange-flavored acidity that lift's the wine's richness. An evolving finish seals the deal. Drink now–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca El Origen,23.0,92.0,"Alluring, attractive aromas of tree bark, licorice, fig and blackberry feed into a layered, concentrated palate with plum, blackberry and peppery flavors.

Malagousia,Greece,Epanomi,Gerovassiliou,23.0,92.0,"A beautiful nose of melon, pear and flowers starts this exemplary single vineyard Malagousia from the producer who helped put it on the modern map. Rich and juicy melon and pear ion the palate interplays with a snap of acidity, giving this wine complexity and a food-friendly boost."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Selvapiana,23.0,92.0,"This blend of 60% Sangiovese 25% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon boasts enticing dark berry, menthol, new leather and dark spice notes. The taut palate doles out black cherry, cassis and licorice flavors, with a pleasant hint of game and fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2027."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Full Pull & Friends,23.0,92.0,"That vintage is not a typo. This 10-year-old wine is as lively as ever. The aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of candy corn, pumpkin spices, candle wax, lemon pith and almond butter—all completely captivating. The palate is lightly creamy in feel but still sleek with zingy tart high-wire acidity and a lingering finish. It's an accomplishment."
White Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,23.0,92.0,"A wood-aged wine, this blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc is rich and lightly toasty. There are also fine yellow fruit and honeyed flavors that give the wine a ripe complexity and that leave with crisp acidity. It's is ready to drink now and until 2022."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Taltarni,23.0,92.0,"Dustings of brown sugar and cinnamon over black cherries leave a lasting impression on the nose of this full-bodied, creamy-textured Shiraz. Plum and chocolate notes creep in on the dry, savory finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de la Grave,23.0,92.0,"A rich, velvet textured wine, full of dense, dusty tannins and sweet black Merlot fruits. The wine is concentrated, ripe and powerful, with a dark texture that is both impressive and ageworthy. Give this wine at least 5–6 years."
Malagousia,Greece,Epanomi,Gerovassiliou,23.0,92.0,"Zippy, fresh aromas of citrus and white fruit lead the nose. Ripe fruit balanced by good acidity and a lingering, luscious finish make this an exemplary Greek pour. Pair with poultry, grilled seafood or enjoy as an apéritif."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Cantina del Giusto,23.0,92.0,"This bright, juicy red offers rose, dark berry, baking spice and new leather scents that mingle together in the glass. On the palate, crushed raspberry, wild cherry, licorice and clove notes are bolstered by chewy tannins and fresh acidity. It's delicious now but will reward a few more years in the cellar."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Losada,23.0,92.0,"It's hard to imagine anyone not liking this deep, lush, purple Mencía from Bierzo. A concentrated, minerally, toasty black-fruit nose sets up blackberry, boysenberry, prune, juniper and beef jerky flavors. On the finish, it's sultry, dark and peppery. There's all sorts of power and sizzle to this; drink through 2019."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,23.0,92.0,"Delightful peachy notes define the fruity friendly nose. The palate adds zesty lemon to this rich fruit to create one of those dramatic and moreish Rieslings that teeter enticingly on the brink of peachy richness and citrus tang. The palate is slender, light footed and dry, the finish is whistle clean and wonderfully appetizing."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Pôpa,23.0,92.0,"This field blend of old white-grape vines—a rarity in the Douro—is rich in the bottle from a mélange of stainless steel, wood fermentation and barrel aging. It is smooth with concentration from the toast flavors and floral complexity. Its ripe character and generous texture make it a wine to drink now."

The smooth, vibrant palate offers a great combination of fruit and spice, doling out juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry and clove flavors, bolstered by polished tannins. Drink through 2020."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,23.0,92.0,"One of a series of wines from vines grown on different soil types, this comes from micro-schist soil, giving a wine that is rich as well as structured. Behind the structure, the wine is spicy, ripe and full in the mouth showing the potential of yellow fruits as well as lime-juice citrus. Drink this concentrated wine from 2016."
Syrah,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Te Awa,23.0,92.0,"A terrific value, this is one of the more forward Syrahs from Hawke's Bay's glorious 2013 vintage. It's on the full side of medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy texture and a crisp, softly dusty finish that underscores a mélange of pepper, clove, cinnamon, blueberries, raspberries and yellow-fleshed plums. Drink now–2023."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Greywacke,23.0,92.0,"Former Cloudy Bay boss Kevin Judd scores big in this challenging vintage. The wine is round, ripe and amply concentrated, with grassy, herbal shadings and pineapple and stone fruit notes that linger on the lush finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Heitz,23.0,92.0,"Tautly structured and lightly refreshing, this wine is an outstanding expression of high-toned stone fruit, lime and salt. The texture is seamless and round, with a lasting streak of juicy acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Tement,23.0,92.0,"The hinted lushness of passion fruit plays intriguingly around the straight-laced acidity of this classy Sauvignon Blanc. The body is light but profound. Very refreshing on its own or with light, delicate foods."
Viognier,US,California,Le Mulet Rouge,23.0,92.0,"Concentrated and rich in flavor and creamy in texture, this wine has a big profile without seeming overtly fruity or oaky. The mouthfeel is lush, broad and quietly powerful, while subtle pear and marzipan flavors coat the palate and linger on the finish. It makes a grand impression and is “meaty” enough to serve with poultry or even beef. Winemaker Tracy Hart used no oak or stainless steel, fermenting and aging the wine in food-grade polyethylene FlexTanks."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,23.0,92.0,"A blend of the winemakers' two favorite vats, this is intended to give the best impression of the vintage. It's bold, ripe and full of dark fruit and big tannins. With nine months of barrel age, it has filled out and will be ready to drink from 2019."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Grand Boise,23.0,92.0,"High-altitude (up to 1,800 feet) mainly north-facing vineyards give this wine its intense character. It is crisp, tight, mineral and concentrated. Acidity cuts through, making this wine right for seafood and spicy Asian cooking. The aftertaste continues this fresh, textured character."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Cafaggio,23.0,92.0,"A pure expression of Sangiovese, this classically crafted wine offers aromas of wild berry, blue flowers, sun-baked earth, clove and a whiff of menthol. The generous, open palate doles out juicy black cherry, plum, white pepper, mint and cinnamon while smooth, polished tannins provide support. It's already accessible but will age well for another few years. An anisette note signals the close. Drink through 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Felsner,23.0,92.0,"Slight smoke surrounds the citric acidity, the palate comes together in a pairing of bright acidity and pleasingly bitter phenolics, yet there is nothing heavy - despite some alcoholic heat. This wears its sophistication very lightly and will age beautifully."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Paul Blanck,23.0,92.0,"Lovely and pure notes of Conference pear hover above a concentrated taut body. This is dry and has a pleasantly bitter pithy edge that seems to draw out the precision of the fruit even more. The palate is streamlined, taut and energetic and the finish is long and impressive with a final flourish of pear and citrus."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Fischer,23.0,92.0,"Spicy notes of miso and yeast appear first on the nose. The palate, full with vivid spritz, amplifies them even more. Bright lemon notes provide freshness, createing a lively, almost warming but still refreshing Grüner that is all about total savoriness, spice and verve."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodegas Fabre,23.0,92.0,"With an opaque purple color and boysenberry aromas that include notes of raisin and prune, this obtuse, chunky Malbec shows hard tannins and deep, dark flavors of black olive, fig, prune and roasted meat. A toasty, slightly hot finish with licorice notes is bullish. Drink this concentrated, ripe Malbec through 2020."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,23.0,92.0,"A straw-colored wine, this was aged in wood and is full of spice as well as fruit. Centered on Antão Vaz and Verdelho, it has acidity, apricot and citrus flavors and good acidity. Beautifully structured, it's rich while still firm and restrained. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Trione,23.0,92.0,"Pressed and fermented in stainless steel vats and partially aged in neutral oak, this wine rewards in a vibrancy of grapefruit, tangerine and peach flavors, allowing space for a plush texture through the long-lasting brightness of the fruit."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Thorn Clarke,23.0,92.0,"Savvy shoppers may be able to find this for about $20, making it an excellent deal in a full-bodied, structured red wine. Cassis, vanilla and plum notes mark the nose and palate, finishing with a flourish of dusty-textured tannins. Drink now–2025."
Chardonnay,US,California,Le P'tit Paysan,22.0,92.0,"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Yohan Lardy,22.0,92.0,"This is a beautifully perfumed wine, ripe with black fruits and generous with its tannins and acidity. It comes from a one-acre parcel called Le Vivier which has 70-year-old vines. It is concentrated, dense and with aging potential. Drink from 2018."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Teso La Monja,22.0,92.0,"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Kitá,22.0,92.0,"This wine, made by Native American descendent Tara Gomez from the Chumash tribe, is dynamic on the nose. It shows both ripeness and minerality, with aromas of crystallized white peach, dewy herbs, green apples and a hint of guava. It's tight, steely and chalky once sipped, opening toward ripe pome fruit and cut grass, ever-evolving in the glass without going overripe."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Thirty-Seven Wines,22.0,92.0,"This impressive white was fermented in equal parts concrete and stainless steel, retaining a lush texture and vibrant minerality. Night-blooming jasmine exudes from the glass before revealing well-defined layers of spiced lemon, peach and white pepper."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Peter Jakob Kühn,22.0,92.0,"While low in alcohol and austere in dryness, there's a remarkable richness of texture that lends an impression of volume and density on the palate. Brisk notes of lemon and tart tangerine shine brightly, but are juxtaposed by an intensely stony, mineral finish. Drink now through 2020."
Zinfandel,US,California,Three,22.0,92.0,"It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style. A firm coating of fine tannins gives grip on the tongue and seems to extend the juicy fruit and dark chocolate notes on the finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Flechas de los Andes,22.0,92.0,"Big-format Malbec is what we're calling this new 15.5% wine from Benjamin de Rothschild and Laurent Dassault, original partners in Michel Rolland's Clos de los Siete project. Round, lush and full of body, Flechas shows muscle but little fat. It's colorful, dark, full of black fruit and long on the finish. It is modern Malbec done for modern palates."
Trincadeira,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,22.0,92.0,"A beautifully structured, ripe wine that's full of juicy blackberry flavors, ripe tannins and a dense texture. The concentration from old vines is a particular character of this firm wine. Age for at least four years to get the full benefits."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,22.0,92.0,"Produced from a field blend of old vines (Vinhas Velhas), this rich wine is powerfully structured. It has dark tannins and great concentration, balancing rich plum flavors and acidity with firm structure. This is a wine for serious aging, don't drink before 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),22.0,92.0,"While initially a bit earthy and savory on the nose, this ethereal kabinett abounds in fruity, floral complexities. Cutting and spry, its sweet, tangy citrus and stone-fruit flavors seem to dance nervously on the palate. It's nuanced and minerally, with a deliciously salty finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Januik,22.0,92.0,"This fresh, young wine, showcases a palate-thrilling mix of ripe tree fruits—sappy apples, juicy citrus—and some hints of pineapple as well. The ripeness turns the lemony fruit into limoncello, and the finish is long and wonderfully refreshing."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lava Cap,22.0,92.0,"This wine beautifully blends vivid fruit, enticing spice and luxuriously creamy flavors that are concentrated, layered and complex. It pulls it all off gracefully due to underlying acidity that supports a lush texture and leads to a long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Sparkman,22.0,92.0,"This is a wonderful edition to Pearl, Sparkman's 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It's vibrant and energetic, the kind of high-wire flavors more commonly found in Sancerre. Three days after it was first tasted, the wine was still drinking beautifully, with candied mixed fruits and terrific concentration."
Viognier,US,Washington,K Vintners,22.0,92.0,"The fruit comes from the cool climate Den Hoed vineyard. It was barrel fermented in neutral French oak Burgundy barrels, yielding a racy, razor-sharp, spicy, detailed, delicious wine. Lovely fruit is highlighted with peppery notes, running the gamut from cucumber on through to tropical flavors. Ripe, full, lingering."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,22.0,92.0,"This is perfumed with crisp apple and light spice aromas. It's a delicate yet concentrated wine, with acidity that's tempered with pepper and a fresh finish. Screwcap."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Iris Vineyards,22.0,92.0,"This limited production wine advances the proposition that Pinot Gris can be substantial, complex and at least as ageworthy as the better Oregon Chardonnays. The mix of melon, white peach and lemon zest flavors, with compelling minerality, may inspire some additional cellar time. Drink now through 2024."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wine & Soul,22.0,92.0,"A big, powerful, fruity wine, this is laden with dry tannins as well as blackberry flavor. Dark and concentrated, it has a solid, dense feel with fruits layered with intense wood notes. It needs at least five years to soften and round out."
Chardonnay,US,California,Brophy Clark,22.0,92.0,"Freshly buttered toast with a thin coating of marmalade comes to mind when sniffing this wine that also shows a touch of cinnamon and Meyer-lemon juice on the nose. The riper, rounded palate offers yellow apples dipped in caramel, sea salt and cinnamon, which pops again on the back end."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château de Jurque,22.0,92.0,"Still young, this is a structured wine with the dark botrytis flavors giving as much richness as sweetness at this stage. Yellow fruits are integrated into a tight, mineral texture that will open up over the next few months. Drink from 2019."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Terre Rouge,22.0,92.0,"This is a lovely wine, dark golden in color yet fresh on the palate, with piercing flavors of green apple, apricot and flowers, its long finish laced with honey. A wine of noticeable depth and balance that gets better in the glass and would make for an unexpected apéritif."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo,22.0,92.0,"Rose, violet, iris and red berry aromas lead the nose on this delicious wine made entirely with Sangiovese. The smooth palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry and crunchy strawberry, while notes of nutmeg, black pepper and cinnamon add depth. It's polished and already enjoyable but hold a few years for complexity."
Red Blend,France,Provence,Les Vignobles Gueissard,22.0,92.0,"This is a rich, aromatic and deliciously herbal wine full of structured black fruits and dense tannins that promise aging. Blackberry and plum flavors dominate, giving freshness and ripeness to this full wine. Drink from 2017."
Rhône-style Red Blend,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,22.0,92.0,"Dark ruby in the glass, this wine's simple cherry fragrance does not do justice to its black cherry, blueberry, vanilla and clove flavors. It's bright from the first sip, with silky tannins and black pepper and sage notes that continue into a finish punctuated by a burst of bright cherry."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Chatelain,22.0,92.0,"Originally planted by monks in the 12th century, this vineyard has produced an intensely herbaceous wine. Steely and crisp with grapefruit and gooseberry flavors, the wine's texture brings out the chalky soil. Still young, it will be better from 2018."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Andriano,22.0,92.0,"This structured Sauvignon reveals alluring fragrances of white flower, stone fruit, hay and cantaloupe aromas. The palate delivers mature peach, honeydew melon and exotic fruit alongside mineral and crisp acidity. The finish is backed up by succulent fruit."
Red Blend,Chile,Rapel Valley,Lapostolle,22.0,92.0,"This Carmenère-led blend is heady, meaty and inviting up front. In the mouth, clamping tannins are delivered amid serious structure. Flavors of berry, cassis, chocolate and spice lead to a lasting, pure finish that fades slowly and in phases. Best through 2019."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Italy Other,Murgo,22.0,92.0,"Spanish broom, orchard fruit and pistachio nut are some of the aromas you'll find on this vibrant sparkler. The lively palate offers pear, apple and citrus alongside a silky perlage."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Paloumey,22.0,92.0,"With a blend that is half Cabernet Sauvignon, half Merlot, this is as rich as the year. The weight of fruit is borne by sweet tannins and layers of wood toast. There is a very dense dusty texture along with fine acidity and final blackberry fruit. It is for aging over the next 4–5 years."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Dog Point,22.0,92.0,"Everything you'd ever want in a Sauvignon Blanc is here—and then some. Grassy, herbal, citrusy aromas set the pace, joined by some slightly feral, wooly pungency that adds even greater complexity. On the palate, it's plump and mouthwatering without being excessively tart, and lingers gloriously on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Mitolo,22.0,92.0,"The finest Jester Cabernet I can remember, this full-bodied yet supple wine features aromas of cassis, cedar and vanilla in fine balance. Cassis and chocolate flavors continue in the same vein, followed by a silky, long finish. Drink now–2028."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wine & Soul,22.0,92.0,Vines aged 35 years and more go into this wine. It has great power and concentration while also having beautiful ripe fruit. Big-hearted berry flavors are balanced by some serious tannins that promise medium-term aging. Drink this wine soon from 2017 or even better wait until 2018.
Austrian white blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ingrid Groiss,22.0,92.0,"While the nose is slow to express itself, the palate immediately bursts with crisp, tart apple, with fresh, green pear, with ripe but zesty citrus. There is an innate lightness and lovely depth in this unforced, honest and utterly refreshing wine. It comes on light feet and draws you in with its fresh-faced authenticity. More please."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Buchegger,22.0,92.0,"A hint of peach on the still closed nose draws you in. The palate with its concentration of zesty citrus peel suggests that this might benefit from some bottle age, so that all that lovely peach and lemon can unfurl. This is sleek, concentrated and packs a punch. Drink 2017–2025 at least."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Lazy Creek,22.0,92.0,"Quite dry and reserved in flavor, this wine is intriguing: subtle rose petal and mineral notes, medium body and a bite of grapefruit zest on the finish that begs for another sip. One of the earliest producers of Gewürztraminer wines in Anderson Valley, it's still one of the best."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,As Laxas,22.0,92.0,"Pure minerals, peach and melon aromas come with a hint of leesy dust. This wine is elegant, chiseled and minerally on the palate. Flavors of dusty apple and citrus end long and stony, with class. Laxas is a top-flight Albariño producer and this vintage is one of its best. Drink now."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Klipfel,22.0,92.0,"Faint notes of lemon zest and apple make for a harmonious nose and palate. The palate brings out more of the tang of red apples and the zing of fresh lemon peel. This is fruit-driven, clean and very appetizing with a nicely concentrated core and a dry, lastinG finish."
Red Blend,Greece,Drama,Domaine Costa Lazaridi,22.0,92.0,"Forest fruits and warming spices lead this elegant red blend. The palate offers cherry and red currant flavors mingling with black pepper, cinnamon and clove. The wine has a brisk mineral edge that keeps it balanced and great for food. A wine with poise that will age."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,22.0,92.0,"While more mineral than fruit-forward on the nose, this pretty, dry Riesling is quite yielding, suggesting ripe, rich pink grapefruit and white peach on the palate. It's feather light but silky in texture, balanced by a strike of lemon acidity that lingers on the finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,22.0,92.0,"This is a lovely, lilting and light version of the variety, so rarely found in this appellation. Highly aromatic in white flowers and even a whiff of roses, it dances on the palate, the acidity tight and able to lift the texture to new heights of flavor and freshness. It shows best with food, preferably spicy."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Ardenvoir,22.0,92.0,"This barrel-fermented Sémillon deftly mixes smoky toast with rich and deep fruit flavors of melon and grapefruit. Exceptionally concentrated and full-bodied, it carries forward into this new vintage the well-established style of Ardenvoir's unique take on Washington Sémillon."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Ardenvoir,22.0,92.0,"Silky and luscious, this extraordinary Sémillon from the makers of the Chateau Rollat red wines sends up cascading scents of orange blossom, orange peel, citrus and light tropical, moving into the mouth with beautifully integrated fruits dappled with honey and tea. Elegant and impressively long, it concludes with a light kiss of toast."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,22.0,92.0,"Getting past the heavy bottle, you find a structured and firm wine that has aging potential. Dark and firm, with rich black-plum flavor and a concentrated texture, the wine is developing into a ripe, impressive wine. The mineral edge will integrate well over the next year. Drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ebner-Ebenauer,22.0,92.0,"The slightest touch of vanilla perfumes the nose. The palate is fresh and takes a little while to reveal its secrets: slowly enjoy this and its peppery savory core will become apparent. This is a quiet, unobtrusive wine—give it time to breathe and let it come towards you. Its gentle harmonious lightness will captivate."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Terre Rouge,22.0,92.0,"It's too bad California can't produce more Grenache Blanc, especially along these lines. This is a crisp, dry, layered white complex in almond, honey, green apple and dried apricot tones and tartness. Very dark in color, like an apricot liqueur, but the flavors are fresh and refreshing."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,SJ Montigny,22.0,92.0,"Firm and steely in structure yet decadently fruity, this light-footed Spätlese offers substance and pleasure in spades. Luscious yellow-peach and tangerine flavors are plush on the palate but balanced judiciously with racy acidity and a deep tang of minerality. Gorgeous already but could hold well through 2021."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Walker Bay,Hamilton Russell,22.0,92.0,"Produced from the cool vineyards at the southern tip of Africa, Hamilton Russell's Chardonnays are world-class wines, fine examples of French winemaking in a South African context. This 2000 is one of the estate's finest to date, a melange of lemon and nuts, mingled with smoky wood flavors, with a layer of acidity and structure that give it great aging ability."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,22.0,92.0,"King Estate makes several different versions of Pinot Gris, but this belongs at the very top, with pitch-perfect pear fruit at its core. Fresh, textural and brightly racy, it's an elegant and generous wine with a crisp, lingering finish that suggests it will continue to improve through 2020."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Montenidoli,22.0,92.0,"Thanks to long maceration and fermentation on the skins, this has heady aromas of Spanish broom, acacia, yellow stone fruit, grilled herb and a whiff of baked bread. Round, savory and fresh, the intriguing palate has an impressive depth of flavors including ripe yellow peach, mature yellow apple, lemon drop, toasted almond, flinty mineral and an earthy note of tilled soil. Tangy acidity brightens the finish."
Roussanne,US,Washington,Patterson,22.0,92.0,"Blended with 15% Viognier and 10% Sémillon, and aged in 50% new French oak, this brightly aromatic wine conveys brown sugar, dried pineapple and papaya. At a whopping 245 g/L residual sugar, it's intensely sweet and rich, with a honeyed, viscous feel."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Bernhard Ott,22.0,92.0,"Lovely, herb-tinged fragrance—as fresh as aloe vera and as aromatic as fig leaf—jumps out of the glass in this wine. The palate contributes yeasty earthiness and concentration, all highlighted by freshness and verve. The finish is clean and zesty."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Château la Genestière,22.0,92.0,"Unusually complex for a rosé, this medium- to full-bodied wine offers a mix of red berries and melon, hints of cinnamon and clove, richness reminiscent of white chocolate and even a tinge of mocha on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2018."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine la Croix des Vainqueurs,22.0,92.0,"While this wine is certainly sweet with yellow fruits and plenty of ripe honey flavors, it also has a beautiful streak of acidity that allows the wine to be crisply textured. There are spice, great fruitiness and a bright tight aftertaste. Drink now, or better from 2020."
Weissburgunder,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,22.0,92.0,"Weissburgunder, or Pinot Blanc, can be a rather subdued grape. But it's delightfully bright and zippy here, boasting sunny shades of apricot, grapefruit and tangerine offset against dazzling lemon-lime acidity. It's brisk and cutting on the palate yet finishes with persistence."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Paul Beaudet,22.0,92.0,"Big, ripe and opulent, its ripe tannins balanced by perfumed red fruits. There is a solid core of dark and smoky dryness, a center that promises good aging. Already, though, the wine is showing its concentration and richness."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Robert Perroud,22.0,92.0,"Originally from a single wooden vat (number five), the wine is a selection from a parcel of 55-year-old vines. It is concentrated and dense, showing considerable aging potential. Dark fruits, acidity and spice come together to produce a rich, concentrated wine. Drink from late 2017."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Syncline,22.0,92.0,"Syrah makes up just over half of this wine, with the balance Mourvèdre, Grenache, Cinsault, Carignan and Counoise. Perfumed aromas of fresh blue and purple fruit, spice and herb lead to achingly pure fruit flavors that persist effortlessly on the finish. It's a one wine charm offensive with a heart-stopping mouthfeel."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Adega Mãe,22.0,92.0,"A blend of the best grapes from the vintage, this is a powerful, oak-aged wine. Concentrated, rich and still showing signs of vanilla from the wood, it slowly reveals its great black fruits and acidity. With firm tannins at the end, the wine will need more time. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Couhins,22.0,92.0,"This is a bright wine—still a little closed but promising fine fruitiness for the future. With herbal acidity, lemon and grapefruit flavors and a zesty tang at the end, it will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Real Companhia Velha,22.0,92.0,"The stately hillside line of cypress trees gives its name to this estate on the south bank of the Douro. This complex, rich and dark wine is densely textured. The tannins are still young, while the black berry fruits pack into the solid structure. This is a wine to age, so drink from 2018."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Eder,22.0,92.0,"Ripe stone fruit beckons: white peach and greengage are held within a taut frame of fragrant and expressive lime and grapefruit zest. The slender palate tingles with freshness and drive. This is clean, brisk and like a clarion call. Purity and focus are all."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,22.0,92.0,"The nose spells delicacy and the palate proves it: this is a light-footed filigree and yet has a firm, straight backbone of spice and zest. Its midpalate texture slowly grows on you and draws you in with mossy notes of pear and ivy."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Jules Taylor,22.0,92.0,"This is a wild-yeast, barrel-fermented wine that makes one wonder why other producers' versions are so pricey. Silky textured and moderately weighty on the palate, it offers up complex aromas of smoky struck flint, subtle herbaceousnes and ripe melon and fig. Drink it now–2017."
Carmenère,Chile,Maule Valley,Alcance,22.0,92.0,A magenta color and ripe grapy aromas of black fruits accented by spice and olive open this plump wide-bodied Carmenère. Spicy black cherry and blackberry flavors are stout and rock solid on a unwavering finish. Drink through 2020.
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,22.0,92.0,"Sumptuous notes of sugar cookie and honeydew perfume this lavish, full-bodied bottling. It's dry on the palate with piercing white-grapefruit acidity, but balanced by a rich, almost creamy, mouthfeel. The finish lingers luxuriously with a murmur of lime-zest astringency."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Pascal Aufranc,22.0,92.0,"Named after the cherry trees that edge this vineyard, the wine is rich and structured. It has concentrated butts and ripe black-cherry flavors. Full bodied and with an aging potential, this fine wine should be drunk from 2018."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,22.0,92.0,"A complex, rich and ripe wine. It shows both a tannic edge and full red fruit flavors. With acidity cutting through, this is finely balanced, a delicious and serious wine that would benefit from a few more months in bottle."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,22.0,92.0,"Unique in style and sourced—these are the oldest Pinot Gris vines in the country—this young, yeasty, textural wine will surely continue to improve in the bottle. Give it a lot of breathing time, and complex layers of rock and fruit unfold. Jicama, cucumber, daikon radish...You get the idea. It tastes as clean and fresh as a mountain spring."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta dos Aciprestes,22.0,92.0,"This is a powerful, dense and impressive wine showing ample weight supported by fruitiness. The acidity from the ripe black-plum fruit gives the wine intensity as well as aging potential. Enjoy this fine wine after 2016."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Paxton,22.0,92.0,"This is wildly aromatic, with floral hints of cracked pepper and apricot lending nuance to the dark berry fruit. The palate is richly textured, leading into a slightly warm, supple finish accented by licorice."
Viognier,US,California,Cedarville,22.0,92.0,"This wine has the complete butter and baking-spice treatment from barrel fermentation to make it rich in aromatics and full and creamy in texture. It has a light tangerine and cream aroma, rich fruit and baking-spice flavors and a lingering finish."
Rosé,US,Washington,Efeste,22.0,92.0,"This blend of Mourvèdre (78%) and Grenache is a very pretty pale peach color. Aged in a mixture of concrete, stainless steel and neutral French oak, it suggests aromas of citrus, strawberry, herb and spice. It tingles the palate with fresh, lively flavors, showing poise and presence with a citrus-filled finish that lingers."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Maison Malet Roquefort,22.0,92.0,"This is a structured wine that shows class and finesse. It has rich juicy blackberry flavors that are supported by some firm tannins and a dense texture. The wine is ready to drink for its fruitiness, although it will be better from 2019."
White Blend,France,France Other,Domaine Rolet Père et Fils,22.0,92.0,"In the oxidative style that is so special to the Jura, this blend of Chardonnay and Savagnin is distinctive. With almond, apricot and yeast flavors, it is dry, a food wine although also, like a fino Sherry, good as an apéritif."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Hiedler,22.0,92.0,"Subtle lemon hints and zesty freshness mellow a little on the creamy but nonetheless very slender, graceful palate. Elegance and purity are hallmarks here and it is depth rather than power that convinces. Very clean finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Malat,22.0,92.0,"Some flinty reduction still hovers over the glass, underneath, riper, appetizing fruit like peach and yellow plum shimmers. There is a fresh, textured phenolic edge and brightening acidity which pulls everything in to a clear, taut focus. This is full of flavor and depth."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Vienna,Weingut Christ,22.0,92.0,"A yeasty funk still hovers over this richly flavored wine: there are hints of Bosc pear, of miso and white pepper. The palate is taut and bright with lime and lemon zest and has ample concentration. From Vienna itself it explains that capital's enduring love affair with Grüner."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Chatelard,22.0,92.0,"From vines planted as its name suggests on granite soil, the wine is structured and dense with rich juicy black fruits. Packed with perfumed fruitiness and acidity, the wine is developing well, ready to drink from late 2017."
Torrontés,US,California,Markus Wine Co,22.0,92.0,"While crisp and bracing due to tart apricot and green apple flavors, this wine deepens on the palate as compelling white raspberry, white peach and subtle floral, spicy notes unfold. Markus Niggli added 5% North Carolina-grown Traminette, making it an interesting and seriously delicious bottle to enjoy over a seafood lunch or as an apéritif."
Syrah,US,Washington,Seven Hills,22.0,92.0,"Once again, here is a Seven Hills wine that opens with truly lovely aromatics. It's a clean varietal expression of Syrah, with medium weight, wild berries and finishing highlights of pepper, earth, sea salt, baking spices and cassis."
Malbec,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Viu Manent,22.0,92.0,"This score for a $22 Chilean Malbec may cause you to do a double-take, but this is really a great wine. The nose is chock full of berry aromas with earth and leather riding shotgun. Flavors and finishing notes of chocolate truffles, espresso, berry syrup and mocha sum it up. The structure is here, as is the core acidity. This wine has everything. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co."
Rosé,US,Washington,Waters,22.0,92.0,"This rare single-vineyard rosé is all Syrah. Pale peach in color, it brings aromas of blood orange and strawberry that are followed by a textured lively palate with an extended finish. It's one of the best rosés the state has produced to date."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Strauss,22.0,92.0,"A touch of peach is edged with leafy notes of citrus foliage and a touch of elderflower. The palate brings out the peach but also a zestiness reminiscent of grapefruit peel, making for a crisp texture. Full of flavor this has a rounded midpalate despite the slender body."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Mittelburgenland,Weninger,22.0,92.0,"The nose still gives away little. The palate also remains tightly curled in itself. This wine needs a little time but promises to blossom with another year of bottle age. It has a gamy streak on the firm, grippy midpalate as well as bright, enlivening freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and the tannins still edgy, but the juiciness of dark fruit is undeniable. Drink 2018–2020."
Riesling,US,California,Claiborne & Churchill,22.0,92.0,"The nose of this bottling is all about bright citrus and yellow flower, with upfront aromas suggesting crushed white rocks, grapefruit pith and sweet grass. It's supercrisp, grippy and sharp in acidity on the palate, showing white flower and clover honey flavors as it opens."
Rosé,Austria,Burgenland,Umathum,22.0,92.0,"The almost luminous pink hue promises exuberance: the wine delivers a plethora of fruit notes—spicy elderberries, luscious strawberries and juicy red cherries all take turns to dazzle. Is this your typical rosé? Certainly not—it's more of an ultralight red that needs chilling. But it certainly delivers sophisticated yet fun drinking. Simply abandon yourself to its joyful flavors and celebrate summer!"
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Bernhard Ott,22.0,92.0,"Subtle notes of both green, crisp Conference pear and ripe Delicious apples yield to some zesty grapefruit notes. There is structure and a resonant background of herbal spice, yeasty notes and fresh white pepper. The palate is streamlined and crisp yet cushioned. Ott once again shows his mastery of this variety—this time with all the freshness of a cooler vintage."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Amalie Robert,22.0,92.0,"Here is an outstanding stainless-fermented Chardonnay, thick and fruity. It's totally loaded with ripe apple and pear-pastry goodness, and the flavors dive deep into a thoroughly delicious, textural finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,22.0,92.0,"Very pure fruit notes of yellow, ripe pear mingle with fresh citrus zest on nose and palate of this supercrisp Grüner. The aftertaste reinforces that wonderful pepperiness and lends extra vivacity to this streamlined, dynamic wine. Very moreish."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato,22.0,92.0,"Heady scents of jasmine, wisteria, chopped herbs and fresh orchard fruit lead the way on this delicious sparkler. The creamy palate doles out Bartlett pear, yellow apple and a hint of white peach alongside bright acidity and a soft perlage. One bottle might not be enough of this."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Chehalem,22.0,92.0,"Lightly dusted with cinnamon and baking spices, this is apple pie in a glass. Along with the lovely apple-pastry richness come lighter suggestions of pear and peach. This immaculate and substantial effort should be consumed now through 2017."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,22.0,92.0,"This is a terrific vintage for this blend, helped by the decision to bump up the alcohol and reduce the residual sugar, now down to 16g/L. Though off dry, this retains a spine of steely acid, highlighting the bright and spicy lemon curd, orange peel and pink grapefruit flavors. It will be delicious with pork roasts or simply sipped with mild cheeses."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Dowsett Family,22.0,92.0,"These vines were planted in 1984; they are dry-farmed with all-natural acids, most unusual for Washington State. So you have a beguiling mix of aromatic, lightly soapy, perfumed, floral scents, matched to exotic passion fruit and grapefruity citrus. There is a lot of acid here, and it's a young wine, but it has wonderful concentration and a full-throttle mix of perfume, fruit and flesh. The finish seems endless, and promises a long life ahead."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,Andrew Rich,22.0,92.0,"This delicious wine makes you wish that a lot more Sauv Blanc was coming out of the Willamette Valley. It's sharp, spicy and bright. The grapefruit and pineapple flavors carry well-defined accents of herb and pine needle. The pinpoint acidity adds further focus."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,22.0,92.0,"This is a superrich, dense wine. It has firm tannins and a steely, mineral edge that permeates the texture. A ripe black-plum flavor is generous while still young and full of fresh acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Falanghina,Italy,Southern Italy,Fattoria La Rivolta,22.0,92.0,"Made with organically cultivated grapes, this opens with aromas of orange blossom, orchard fruit and nuts. The savory, medium-bodied palate doles out layers of juicy nectarine, lime zest, ripe pear and mature yellow apple alongside a note of candied ginger. It finishes on a tangy note."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Fabien Collonge,22.0,92.0,"Produced from 45-year-old vines, this is a fruity ripe wine. It has concentration and some firm tannins as well a generous black-fruit character. The wine's acidity and structure will allow it to age another year, so drink from late 2017."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Uwe Schiefer,22.0,92.0,"Dark, brooding blueberry scents permeate this light-bodied red on the nose and palate. Fresh and tinged with white pepper spice, it boasts tart, crunchy fruit and ample depth despite the coolness of the vintage. Those who love reds with tension will fall in love. Drink now–2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Firestone,22.0,92.0,"This wine impresses, with cedar, black cherries, dill and licorice on the complex nose. Sagebrush and blueberries power the palate, which also shows charred beef, asphalt and smoked meats. This is proving to be a very heavy and deep wine."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Casina di Cornia,22.0,92.0,"Made from organically farmed grapes, this delicious 100% Sangiovese launches with an intense fragrance of wild cherry accompanied by whiffs of Mediterranean herbs and aromas that recall meat juices. The succulent black cherry flavors are accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon and clove alongside polished tannins. It's well-balanced and surprisingly fresh for the vintage. Chartrand Imports, Savio Soares Selections, Natural Wine Company."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,22.0,92.0,"An intensely mineral expression of Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, full of citrus flavors, deliciously fresh, but also complex. The wine is concentrated into a steel spring of ripeness, ready to burst from the glass."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Chapelle aux Moines,22.0,92.0,"At the eastern end of Saint-Emilion, this vineyard is close to Castillon. The wine has structure and density, with powerful tannins that are still filling out. Delicious, juicy black plum and damson flavors are going to be full and generous, while remaining fruity. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,Australia,Western Australia,Plantagenet,21.0,92.0,"Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Spangler,21.0,92.0,"This bright and spicy wine is packed with botanical flavors. The aromatics are pungent and intense, pushing sharp notes of lime, Meyer lemon and orange soda deep into the palate. In some ways this has the penetrating density of Gewürztraminer. It's bold and distinctive, though clearly different from other domestic Viogniers."
Assyrtico,Greece,Santorini,Boutari,21.0,92.0,"Intense aromas of lemon, grapefruit and mint lead this appealing white. On the palate, a fantastic balance of fresh citrus fruit and sea-salt minerality finishes with an herbal, earthy spin. Delicious on its own or paired with fish or chicken."
Arneis,US,California,Briceland,21.0,92.0,Great balance and a charming lighter character make this lightly floral wine especially enjoyable. The orange blossom aromas and ripe melon flavors are vivid but not heavy as they weave through a smooth yet crisp texture and linger on the finish.
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac,21.0,92.0,"This wine is very young, with its bright purple color, spice and wood aromas and firm texture. Although the wood is still integrating, its ripe blackberry fruit and rich texture show it has great potential and needs to age. Drink from 2020."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,21.0,92.0,"This is a vibrantly rich wine that is brimming with delicious red fruit notes and bright acidity. Full and concentrated, it has weight without being heavy. It is a finely made wine, with a crisp finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Véronique Günther-Chereau,21.0,92.0,"Gorges is one of the recently created village crus or village appellations in Muscadet. The wine has richness and a dense character not always found in Muscadets. While it has some age, which has softened the intense fruit, it is still crisp, fruity and ripe with apple, lime and spice. Drink now."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Stéphane Aviron,21.0,92.0,"Produced from two separate vineyards, the wine has all the concentration of old vines. It has tannins and dark fruits, blackberry and black plum. This is a finely structured cru wine that will need to age. Drink from 2020."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,21.0,92.0,"How can such lightness, such supple slenderness, come with such full flavor? Visions of swirling citrus are made manifest here. Mandarin, kumquat, tangerine: they all dance and flit around a central seam of freshness. Lovely and almost irresistible now, but sure to advance most gracefully."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine du Clos Gautier,21.0,92.0,"Made from low-yielding, 70-year-old vines, this is a dense wine with an almost-dark structure and ripe red-plum flavors. Powerful, it obviously will be better with food and could even benefit from decanting before drinking. Age this concentrated wine until late 2016."
Zinfandel,US,California,Chiarito,21.0,92.0,"John Chiarito is making Italian varieties like Nero d'Avola and Negro Amaro––as well as estate-grown Petite Sirah and Zinfandel––on the outskirts of Ukiah, from his basement winery. There he combines an Old-World sensibility with New World techniques. He's nailing it here with a rustic, tannic but intensely delicious Zin full of berry aromas and a spicy finish. Big and hearty, this wine has soul."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trivento,21.0,92.0,"Aromas of ripe blackberry, prune and minerality are upright and intense. The palate is lush, smooth and balanced, while blackberry and cassis lead the flavor assault. A deep, long and delicious finish confirms that this wine offes great value for just over $20."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Carnuntum,Markowitsch,21.0,92.0,"Sumptuous red cherry, wrapped in velvety structure, presents a ripe and rounded Pinot Noir with earthy, autumnal edges. It offers lovely balance and constant glimpses of red fruit, oaky spice and soft yet crunchy midpalate mouthfeel. This will benefit from holding 2016–2017 in bottle."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,WillaKenzie Estate,21.0,92.0,"This is a lush and fragrant wine, instantly appealing with aromas of orange blossom and sweet pear. Quite dry and concentrated, it brings further flavors of citrus, grapefruit and lemon rind as it plays out in a lingering, refreshing finish."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,21.0,92.0,"An immaculate wine, showcasing the grace and elegance of which this variety is capable. It's a delicate, perfectly balanced mix of green fruits—apple, gooseberry—fresh herbs and a crisp bite of celery. It's just rounded off enough to warm up the acidity and provide a hint of white peach as it rolls through an extended and detailed finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,21.0,92.0,"Stylish and detailed, this exemplary effort showcases a subtle and elegant approach to the grape. Rather than fleshy fruit flavors, it offers focused notes of pear skin, citrus rind and an overriding minerality. It's drinking quite nicely already, and seems built to continue to evolve through 2020."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Cognettes,21.0,92.0,"The village of Clisson is the home of the Perraud family and also its own mini-appellation. This rich wine is full of fruit, developing a nut and pepper character that adds complexity. It is a well-balanced wine, still with its acidity and a crisp lemon aftertaste. Drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Terras do Sado,Herdade da Comporta,21.0,92.0,"A big and densely textured wine that shows great rich swathes of bitter chocolate, dark tannins and sweet acidity. The wine has power, dark aromas and an intense concentration."
Merlot,Canada,British Columbia,Tinhorn Creek,21.0,92.0,"This impressive, pure Merlot offers plenty of grip and concentration. Black-cherry fruit and dark chocolate, espresso and fine-grained tannins are all in play. The structure, length and polish make this a standout, especially at this price."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Eder,21.0,92.0,"An almost tropical overtone of passion fruit precedes the zesty, herbal notes that fizz away on nose and palate. Citrus zest frames the palate which is streamlined, light-bodied but concentrated. This offers verve, clean-cut refreshment and zesty length."
Chardonnay,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château d'Antugnac,21.0,92.0,"Ripe Chardonnay, barrel fermentation and aging, stirring of the lees—all these elements make for a powerfully rich wine, in which the wood acts as a carefully judged supporting act to the intense apples and cream fruitiness. There is just a touch of Burgundian minerality to give some structure."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Gaudou,21.0,92.0,"From a small parcel of vines in the Gaudou vineyard, this impressive wine is rich and still very young. Matured in egg-shaped tanks, it is dense with fruit as much as tannin, poducing a spicy wine full of black fruits and a dry core that is already well integrated. Drink from 2019."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sextant,21.0,92.0,"Lush and tasty, this is strikingly affordable for the alluring layers of aromas and flavors present. It begins with cherry pie on the nose alongside black licorice, bay leaf, roasting meats and mushrooms, and continues on the palate with soft and jammy berries. Yet it has a serious side too, with flavors of menthol and stewed tomatoes delivering the umami factor."
Graciano,US,California,Bokisch,21.0,92.0,"Fruity, dusty and soft, a dark cherry and plum Graciano grown and made in Lodi with great depth, balance and earthiness. The grape is native to Rioja where it is usually blended with Tempranillo, but does deliciously here on its own. From Lodi Rules Certified Green grapes."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Bisol,21.0,92.0,"Enticing scents of white flowers and citrus blossom lead the nose of this elegant wine. Silky and crisp, the bright palate delivers yellow apple, pear and a tangy hint of tangerine, framed in vibrant acidity and a polished perlage."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Van Zellers,21.0,92.0,"A complex and intense wine. Its black fruits and sweet plums, balanced with tight acidity, go along with dense, dry tannins. It is textured, structured, ready for long-term aging."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Plantagenet,21.0,92.0,"This is a terrific Chardonnay at a great price, offering subtle notes of toasted grain upfront, followed by bright lemon-lime fruit and crisp acidity. It's medium-bodied, so it won't overpower whatever food you serve it with and the laser beam of citrusy acidity on the finish is wrapped in a gauzy sheath of pleasant nuttiness. Drink now–2020, possibly longer."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Pichot,21.0,92.0,"This single vineyard wine has enormous potential. At this stage it is dry and not quite integrated. But with the rich fruitiness, the hints of yellow fruits and the tight mineral character, this wine will age extremely well. Drink from 2021."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Margerum,21.0,92.0,"This blend of 48% Grenache Blanc, 14% Roussanne, 14% Viognier, 12% Marsanne and 12% Vermentino is one of the best and zippiest white Rhône-inspired blends on the market right now. Its clean nose offers key lime, grapefruit pith and gunpowder tea aromas. The palate is grippy and fresh, with zesty lime skin and the slight bubblegum flavors."
Viognier,US,Washington,Stevens,21.0,92.0,"As usual, this was sourced entirely from a small block in the Dineen vineyard. Fragrant with a mélange of lemony aromas, the flavors carry the same theme—lemon gelato, lemon pie, limoncello, all buoyed with perfect acidity. It's a vivid, clean, long-lasting wine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta de Sant'Ana,21.0,92.0,"Aragonez (aka Tempranillo) is the backbone of this finely textured wine. The fruit and the tannins are well integrated giving a rich wine that is also stylish. The acidity, the wood texture and the ripe red-berry fruits are all showing potential. Drink the wine now."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Lachini,21.0,92.0,"This offers exceptional concentration and power. Sweet strawberry fruit is dense and detailed, bringing hints of spice and milk chocolate into play through a long, utterly satisfying finish."
Moscatel,Portugal,Moscatel de Setúbal,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,21.0,92.0,"Extended wood aging has deepened the gold color of this wine and brought out the old wood, old gold flavors. It is opulent, with plenty of acidity as well as spice and perfume. It is not the sort of wine to age in bottle, so drink now with dried fruits or blue cheeses."
Neuburger,Austria,Burgenland,Tinhof,21.0,92.0,"The subtlest overtones of pine and mint hover above the rather citrus-focused nose that also comes with a good dose of white pepper. The palate reverberates with savory, herbal spiciness. A cooler vintage has turned the usually very nutty and rounded Neuburger into a spicier but equally interesting food companion. Lemon zest and pepperiness provide a lasting finish."
Albariño,US,Oregon,Abacela,21.0,92.0,"This is an over-the-top vintage for this wine; it's simply crammed full with floral and fresh fruit flavors. Grapefruit, peach and melon notes are in abundance, all juicy, ripe and resonant. It would be hard to imagine a better or more versatile non-Chardonnay white at this price."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,21.0,92.0,"The nose is still shy but the palate has an almost-fizzing freshness that speaks of a multitude of aromas: green-apple peel, green-pear flesh, a touch of yeast and a salty, savory, peppery edge of miso. This is compact with a good creamy core in its slender and slinky body, but full of flavor and verve."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,WillaKenzie Estate,21.0,92.0,"Rich and floral, this top-notch Pinot Blanc hits the palate with verve and ripe, complex fruit flavors. There's a streak of delicious vanilla under the honeydew and Meyer lemon richness, and the length and power are especially impressive for a Pinot Blanc."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,I Fabbri,21.0,92.0,"This wine has aromas of underbrush, cherry and leather, with a hint of spices. The palate boasts wild cherry, mint, menthol, and meat juices and shows structure and balance. Give this a few more years to develop complexity. Siena Imports, Barsotti Wines."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,21.0,92.0,"Another fine white wine from Chehalem, dry but not sour, with lovely sweet/tart peach and pear, honeysuckle and lime flavors co-mingled. It has a full midpalate and a clean, refreshing finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Syncline,20.0,92.0,"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Raptor Ridge,20.0,92.0,"A pretty light gold hue, this wine shines brightly from the first sniff to the last sip. It's clean and dense, with notes of bee pollen and lemon oil, flavors of apple and pear, and a touch of vanilla cookie."
Red Blend,US,California,Freakshow,20.0,92.0,"Dark, dense with fruit flavor and thickly tannic, this full-bodied wine is a monument to concentration, ripeness and richness. Massive tannins are matched by huge jammy fruit, with a sense of layering and depth that is impressive and satisfying to experience."
Zinfandel,US,California,Boeger,20.0,92.0,"Brilliant strawberry and raspberry aromas, bright and effusive fruit flavors, and a sense of freshness and purity make this wine from one of El Dorado County's oldest wineries a pleasure to drink. It's full bodied, has a smooth texture, mild tannins and a lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Aconcagua Valley,Errazuriz,20.0,92.0,"This is a powerful Cabernet comprised of all the key players. The nose is oaky, with coconut and vanilla aromas alongside fast and furious spiced berry scents. A meter-pushing palate tastes of spiced cherry, blackberry, herbs and chocolate, while the finish simmers with coffee and mocha notes. Drink through 2020."
Tempranillo,US,California,Quinta Cruz,20.0,92.0,"Tight blueberry, hot blacktop and a flash of purple flowers combine for an earth-driven nose on this wine from a hot region in southern Monterey County. The flavors are quite distinctive, with barely ripe mulberries, cedar-edged blackberries, sandalwood shavings and a touch of graphite."
Moscato,Canada,British Columbia,LaStella,20.0,92.0,"This irresistible, lightly frizzante and utterly refreshing wine is a gem. Orange flesh and rind has a slightly candied potency, with outstanding purity, focus and length. In spite of the sweetness, it retains offsetting minerality and acidity, making it a perfect apéritif or brunch wine."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Château d'Aqueria,20.0,92.0,"The 2015s Tavels are almost uniformly excellent, so it's no surprise that this bottling, from a large estate excels. Crushed stone and strawberry notes mark the nose, while the full-bodied palate folds in hints of savory, olive-like complexity. Drink now."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Le Casematte,20.0,92.0,"A blend of 65% Grillo and 35% Carricante, this offers subtle aromas of ripe orchard fruit, wild flower and a whiff of almond. The vibrant, savory palate boasts green apple, creamy white peach, citrus and aromatic herb alongside an energizing mineral vein. It finishes crisp and clean."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,20.0,92.0,"A rich, creamy, sumptuous wine, with an impressive, decisive shaft of minerality and a stony, dense character. The name of the wine, referring to the granite and schist soil, is one of an extraordinary series reflecting different soil types made by Muscadet's top producer, Guy Bossard."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Passadouro,20.0,92.0,"A big-hearted, fruity wine. With its ripe tannins and red berry fruits, this red is certainly powerful, but it manages to keep its balance, finishing ripe and sweet. This is a wine that could be enjoyed now, but would certainly age over the next 4–5 years."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Claiborne & Churchill,20.0,92.0,"From a winery focused on Alsatian wines since starting in 1983, this tremendous Gewürztraminer is redolent with grilled lemon peels, lilac and a chalky minerality. On the elegant and tasty palate, there are white rocks, roasted nectarines, yellow apples and noticeable salinity."
Red Blend,Chile,Central Valley,Bodega Volcanes de Chile,20.0,92.0,"This blend of Grenache, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre is fighting (and winning) above its weight (price) class. Tarry, gritty, asphalt-like aromas blend with smoky berry notes to form an inviting bouquet. The palate is round and juicy in feel, with herbal, minty red-berry flavors and a deep, flush finish that's showing a high level of complexity. Drink through 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Geyerhof,20.0,92.0,Miso and yeast are met by lemon zest and pear peel. The palate is streamlined and slender and homes in on a central vein of beautiful grass and herb-scented freshness. This literally dances on and off the palate and leaves you with wonder that such lightness can have so much flavor.
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Piattelli,20.0,92.0,"Piattelli is an under-the-radar label that makes very good to excellent Malbec from old vines in Luján del Cuyo, Mendoza. And the prices are more than fair. This wine is big and focused, with intense blackberry, chocolate and espresso qualities throughout. And the finish is midnight dark. Good through 2012."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Angel Vine,20.0,92.0,"It's a shame that just 100 cases of this wine were made, as this bright, fresh, exciting Zinfandel belongs with the best of California, not just Washington. The fresh-picked strawberry and raspberry flavors are concentrated and vibrating with juicy acidity. They lead into a sappy, lengthy midpalate, with an underpinning of rock."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,20.0,92.0,"Subtle yellow peach and mineral tones on the nose intensify on the palate of this surprisingly tropical kabinett. Mouthwatering acidity pulses a laser beam through layers of sweet mango, melon and tangerine, extending a long, spine tingling finish. It's delightful now, but should keep drinking well through 2025."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Sepp Moser,20.0,92.0,"This nose is a lovely mix of lemon peel and camphor leaves, intriguing and refreshing and just a little heady. The palate is streamlined and slender and of great purity. This is lithe but intense, slender but profound. It shows what Riesling is capable of in a cooler year. Stockpile this since it will last and get ever more delicious. Drink now till 2020."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaines Dominique Piron,20.0,92.0,"A blend from different parts of the Fleurie appellation, this wine is elegant and floral. Crisp red fruits are sustained by acidity and by a juicy character. As often with this appellation, it is a wine to age and will be better from 2018."
Riesling,US,Washington,Poet's Leap,20.0,92.0,"This shows lively acidity, with ripe but tart fruit and an alcohol level just slightly above 12%. The grapes used were sourced from the Benches (German clones) and old vine plantings at Dionysus. It's a lush Poet's Leap, lightly tasting of honey, and loaded with pretty flavors of Meyer lemon, ripe orange, and candied pineapple."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Armida,20.0,92.0,"Just 10% of this wine was fermented in new French oak which adds a bit of weight and length. Grapefruit, peach and lime mingle on the palate, a briny afterthought providing an edge. Smooth and refreshing, it ends in a long dream of lemon."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,Adega Mãe,20.0,92.0,"Large French oak barrels were used to ferment this toasty, ripe wine, which boasts notes of stone fruit and citrus. A mix of cool-climate Portuguese grapes and Chardonnay, it will smooth out and become rich and complex with time; drink after 2016."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,20.0,92.0,"This producer, firmly established in Vinho Verde and the Douro, also has vineyards at Quinta da Aguieira in the central coastal region of Bairrada. A blend of local white grapes along with some Chardonnay, this wine is ripe, with a touch of saltiness and minerality, plus plenty of concentration from old vines. With its rich texture and crisp aftertaste, this is ready to drink."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,20.0,92.0,"Produced in the small white-wine enclave within the Madiran appellation, this wine is a blend of the two emblematic grapes of the region. It's rich and full bodied, hinting at the ripeness of the sweet wines that are also made here. It has style, along with intense acidity, apricot and pear flavors and smooth fruitiness. Drink now."
Riesling,US,Washington,Milbrandt,20.0,92.0,"A taut, tense fight between the acids and sugars highlight this excellent dessert wine. A strong streak of spicy grain runs straight through the compact citrus and honey fruit flavors. The sweetness is neither cloying nor syrupy—rather, it neatly laces the wine together."
White Blend,US,Washington,O•S Winery,20.0,92.0,"Winemaker Bill Owen (the ‘O' in O•S) has a knack for making white wines from red wine vineyards. This pungent, ripe, stylish Sauvignon Blanc/Sémillon blend is a fine example. The fruit flavors are thick and juicy— pineapple, golden apple, citrus—and the herbaceous nature of the grape has been transmuted into a sweet grassy streak, supported with mouth-searing acids. It's a roller-coaster ride, and delicious all along the way."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,20.0,92.0,"Soos Creek's value-priced Sundance Red really shines in 2010. A Bordeaux-style blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Franc, it rivals the top-tier efforts from any number of wineries. Plum, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors are leavened with a dash of herb. Tannins are dusty and detailed, and the wine has the stuffing to age over the next half decade or more."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle & Dr. Loosen,20.0,92.0,"Eroica has a proven ability to age; in fact it needs at least a half decade in the cellar to show its real strengths. Tight and packed with primary fruit flavors of lime and peach, this beautifully proportioned wine has perceptible sweetness but plenty of natural acidity. Lively and fresh today, but best given a few more years in the cellar."
Syrah,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,20.0,92.0,"A gorgeous wine, dense with flavor. Smooth and plummy, it's loaded with thick streaks of licorice, chocolate, baking spices and coffee liqueur. Long and flowing, it just seduces from the first sip to the last swallow."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,20.0,92.0,"This is finely proportioned, with intense fruit flavors laced with spice, acidity and a mineral texture. Made using grapes from a single vineyard, it is concentrated, with a depth of intense flavor. For aging over 3–4 years. Screwcap."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Coussin,20.0,92.0,"Crisp, bright and delicious, this has pure red fruit, with an herb note, intense acidity and a tangy texture."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,20.0,92.0,"Ripe and creamy, this is full of rich pear and green plum fruit. It has weight and is layered with acidity, with a spice note and a taut, mineral texture. This is complex and age worthy."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Cambon la Pelouse,20.0,92.0,"This is a tight and firm wine that will take some time to develop. The fruit, an almost equal blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is all present and will fill out over the next few years. It is a serious dense wine with great aging potential. Drink from 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Capbern,20.0,92.0,"With fine, dusty tannins, this rich and juicy wine wears its fruit on its sleeve, all black plums and blackberry flavors. The acidity of the year is almost sweet with the fresh ripeness of the fruit. It is developing well, showing a medium-term future. Drink from 2018."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Coussin,20.0,92.0,"Textured, dry rosé that reveals its rich character slowly. The Sumeire family, making wine at Coussin for 200 years, has mastered the production of a serious, food-friendly style of rosé."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,20.0,92.0,"Aged for a year in wood, this concentrated, structured wine is seriously rich and concentrated. It has a dark texture and smoky flavors of licorice as well as black plum fruit. It is complex and powerful and would benefit from more aging. Drink from 2018."
Rosé,US,Washington,Southard,20.0,92.0,"Put this into a blind flight of French rosé, and it will seem like one of the crowd. Crafted from 65% Grenache, 29% Syrah and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is bone dry, dusty and detailed, showing a gorgeous onion-skin hue. The elegance and length are exceptional."
Viognier,US,Oregon,RoxyAnn,20.0,92.0,"A gorgeous effort, awash in high-toned floral aromatics, sharply penetrating, and leading to a densely-packed palate of waxy fruit, honeyed spice, Meyer lemon, citrus and stone fruit. Rich, lush, concentrated and long—what more can you ask from a Viognier?"
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,20.0,92.0,"Perfumed aromas give this wine a smooth, polished feel. Hints of mint go with the well integrated tannins that firm up the sweet blackberry flavors. A great ripe swathe of fruit is laced with acidity on the finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Renacer,20.0,92.0,"With its reliance on old-vines vineyards, Renacer often comes out with great wines. This is one of them. Smoky, leathery berry aromas are inviting, while the mouthfeel is silky and plush. Oaky flavors of chocolate, smoked meat and vanilla accent ripe berry flavors, then clove and baking spices pour onto the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Vila da Fonte,20.0,92.0,"The old vines do their work and produce a highly concentrated wine. It has a dusty tannic structure, the tannins held in suspension surrounded by ripe black plum flavors. The oak aging adds to the richness of this fine, balanced wine that will age for several years. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Handley,20.0,92.0,"Crisp and very floral, this is a beautiful showcase of Anderson Valley's cool climate and commitment to Alsatian varieties. There's a great depth of flavor here—fig, grapefruit, lime and orange peel—not to mention tremendous minerality. This is a wine that can be sipped all day long or enjoyed with fish, poultry or an onion tart."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tulpen,20.0,92.0,"A Rhône blend that will, in future vintages, not be varietally named, this is far from a standard Washington Syrah. It's threaded beautifully with nuances of fruit and spice from the Viognier coferment, Grenache and Mourvèdre that are included. Aromatic, spicy and weaving together chocolate, licorice, granite, roasted meat and berry flavors, it is both substantial and forward."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa Anadia,20.0,92.0,"Dating back to the 16th century, this estate produces some classic Dão wines. With its rich tannins and minerality and with the influence of Touriga Nacional in this field blend, this wine is structured, still firm with tannins. Luscious fruits are held in check by the tannins. Let it soften more and drink from 2019."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Henry Fessy,20.0,92.0,"A richly aromatic wine, with swathes of sweet fruit, ripe tannins and a juicy, jammy feel. This is so generous, open, welcoming. There is structure as well, cushioned by the sweet fruits."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Henry Fessy,20.0,92.0,"Ripe, rounded and generous, a warm plum juice-flavored wine. There is power and concentration. It is a very complete, ageworthy wine, although accessible now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,20.0,92.0,"This full-bodied wine is complex and detailed from the spicy perfume to the finish, and rich and satisfying in the middle. Aromas like black tea and rhubarb lead to ripe and deep cherry and slightly tangy raspberry flavors that are lifted by moderate tannins and linger on the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Chacewater,20.0,92.0,"A meaty, gamy Syrah boasting aromas of bacon and duck-liver mousse, this wine delivers tremendous flavor and quality for the price. It offers plenty of body around a core of plush, savory tannins and a long finish of pepper and cinnamon spice. Start slicing the charcuterie."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,20.0,92.0,"The lovely, pure citrus hints suggested on the nose are fulfilled on the palate: aromatic tangerine peel and vivid, ripe Amalfi lemon. This has such lightness, ease and quintessential Wachau verve that you can't help going in for more. The finish is dry and irresistibly long."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Peter Nicolay,20.0,92.0,"While intensely fruity, a deep vein of crushed-slate minerality extends from nose to finish in this lithe Kabinett. Lip-smacking honey and peach flavors penetrate through the palate, electrified by a laser of lemon-lime acidity. Finishes remarkably dry and fresh."
Syrah,US,California,Robert Hall,20.0,92.0,"Strong aromas of blackberry extract, cedar, nose-tickling herbs and a bit of bacon fat mark the nose of this release from a winery whose 84-year-old namesake died in October 2014. The flavors balance tartness with ripe berries, roasted fennel, emergent tannins and purple flowers that linger into the finish."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Eisenberg,Jalits,20.0,92.0,"Distant woodsmoke, ripe blueberry and notions of amarena cherry create an aromatic opening. The palate is toned and has an enticing, fresh-faced but sophisticated red cherry fruitiness in a taut structure. While this wine is concentrated, it also shows poise and a light-footedness. Elegance, aroma and finesse—all in one sip."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta Monteti,20.0,92.0,"Supple and structured, this delicious red offers scents of Mediterranean scrub, mint, blue flowers and ripe berries. Made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 20% Alicante, the juicy palate delivers Morello cherry, cassis, mocha and wild aromatic herb notes. Supple tannins carry the savory flavors. Enjoy through 2016."
White Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,20.0,92.0,"This wood-aged wine is an impressive blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc. The result is a wine that is rich, spicy, layered with creamy wood while preserving an intense freshness. From a stony vineyard, it has some of minerality that comes from the soil. It is a wine to age; drink from 2017."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Mas de Libian,20.0,92.0,"This superripe blend of Grenache (70%), Syrah (15%) and Mourvèdre (15%) is full-bodied, with a rich, creamy texture and a long, velvety finish. Spice and herb notes accent dusty black cherries, and a hint of cocoa sneaks in as well. Drink now–2017."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,20.0,92.0,"Despite a nose and palate that delivers plenty of mixed citrus fruit, this comes across as very dry. It's lemony and crisp on the long, austere finish. Drink now with oysters, or cellar for 5–10 years."
Roussanne,US,Washington,Andrew Rich,20.0,92.0,"A deftly made wine, this exceptional Roussanne blends fruit into a creamy, luscious blend of tropical fruits, apricots, whole cream, nutmeg and more. There is so much fruit that it's easy to overlook the crisp acid underpinning, the nice details of baking spices and the exceptional strength through the lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,Leah Jørgensen Cellars,20.0,92.0,"This delightful and refreshing wine is atypical in all the right ways. Intensely aromatic, it conveys a lush mix of honeysuckle, sweet hay, smoke, lime and honeydew melon. And that's before you take the first sip. The low alcohol and bright acidity set it up for a wide range of poultry, pasta and seafood options, and anything with goat cheese is sure-fire."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,WillaKenzie Estate,20.0,92.0,"I don't know anyone making better Pinot Gris in Oregon than this premiere property. Rich, ripe, round and sensuous, this lush and textured wine unwraps its ripe fruit in layers of pear/apricot flavor, enhanced with bright spice and finished with flavors of vanilla cream."
Vermentino,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Argiolas,20.0,92.0,"This 100% Vermentino opens with heady scents of Spanish broom, white wild flower, lemon blossom and citrus. The vibrant, savory palate boasts a pristine fruit purity, doling out juicy nectarine, ripe pear, lemon zest and mineral alongside refreshing acidity."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodega Carmen Rodríguez,20.0,92.0,"Inviting aromas of balsam wood, pipe tobacco and black fruits are lusty and deep. This is big and drawing on the palate, with ribald flavors of blackberry, licorice, chocolate and mocha. A rich, chocolaty, oaky finish with controlled acidic kick and tannic bite confirm the wine's power and spirit. Drink through 2020."
Dolcetto,US,California,Palmina,20.0,92.0,"Fresh on the nose with black plum, dried tarragon, hot asphalt, potpourri and a touch of Earl Grey tea, this is a well-priced wine with great versatility for all sorts of foods. The palate is vibrant and bursting with energy, juicy enough for a summer day but made serious with firm tannins. It could hold up to steak as well as complementing roasted fish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Campolargo,20.0,92.0,"A blend of five grapes, this is a firm, tannic and age-worthy wine. Even the high alcohol doesn't show on the rich, well-balanced palate. It's full of plum and black currant flavors, and wood-derived flavors show on the finish."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Château du Coudray Montpensier ,20.0,92.0,"Still young, this is going to be a ripe wine with a fine structure and rich fruitiness. It has a mineral edge and concentration from the old vines. The berry fruits have been smoothed by the wood aging to give a rich wine that will age further. Drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beiras,Quinta de Foz de Arouce,20.0,92.0,"Dark, with dusty tannins and a solid, firm structure, this has a dense character. The black plum fruit and intense underlying acidity yield a powerful wine that will age over several years."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Easton,20.0,92.0,"A fine vintage of Bill Easton's Cabernet Franc, from the Monarch Mine Vineyard, where he typically sources tremendous Syrah and Barbera, this wine is still developing and will do nicely with time. For now it shows perfumed herbal restraint, subtle spice and a twist of oaky coffee on the finish. A savory wine that would pair well with filet mignon à point."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Castello di Neive,20.0,92.0,"From one of the best vineyard sites in the Barbaresco-making village of Neive, this offers aromas of raspberry, tilled soil, tobacco and chopped herbs. The chewy, delicious palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed blackberry and baking spice alongside enveloping, velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's a superb Barbera."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine les Pins,20.0,92.0,"This rich, structured wine is packed with both firm tannins and rich red fruits. Still young, it has all the makings of a dense, balanced wine that will reflect the great fruit of the vintage. Age this smoky, full-bodied wine and drink from 2017."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Le Morette,20.0,92.0,"Exquisite floral aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine are joined by a whiff of mature pear. The round, juicy palate doles out ripe peach, juicy citrus and yellow apple while a white almond note backs up the lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Huia,20.0,92.0,"This wine harmoniously blends hints of cut grass and struck flint with pink grapefruit. It's medium in body, not at all overdone, delivering the long citrus and berry finish with the precision of cut crystal."
Chardonnay,US,California,Calera,20.0,92.0,"Josh Jensen's appellation blend is arguably the best American white wine for the price. This vintage offers squeezed tangerine, fleur de sel, lily, apple blossom, apple fritters and a touch of tropicality on the nose. The palate is more steely in structure, with chalk and concrete minerality followed by grapefruit skin and lime flavors, revealing the slightest hint of balanced butter tones."
Moschofilero,Greece,Peloponnese,Lantides,20.0,92.0,"This wine starts with a soft nose of rose, tropical fruit and a touch of spice. Its flavors of citrus and spice are complex but buoyed by a laser focused minerality. Elegant and classic, and worthy of aging."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,20.0,92.0,"Named on whim after a peacock's feathers and hence a fan, this attractive wine is full of bright fruit and the proper stony mineral structure typical of the Dão. The wood aging has given the wine extra richness without losing the fruit. Drink this finely wrought wine from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Efeste,20.0,92.0,"The first Feral made by new winemaker, Peter Devison, continues a tradition of excellence. Natural yeasts and fermentation in neutral oak, combined with a superb vintage and world class vineyard, equal a gorgeous bottle of wine. Creamy, leesy, textural and deeply imbued with mineral-soaked citrus fruit, flesh and rind, this ultrarefreshing wine is a joy. Notes of cucumber and melon contribute further complexity through the long finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Balletto,20.0,92.0,"This is a delightful wine, crowd pleasing and complex. It benefits from its lack of oak by focusing on its lifted fruit—a twist of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapefruit—its acidity nicely measured and not one-dimensional. The crisp freshness is complemented by a hint of white rock and subtle lushness on the back palate."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Casa Smith,20.0,92.0,"An inaugural release, this wine displays aromas of red and blue fruit, herbs and spice. The tart red and blue-fruit flavors show irresistible charm, like drinking a bowl of fruit. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but it's 100% delicious."
G-S-M,Australia,South Australia,Kurtz Family,20.0,92.0,"At nearly 80% Grenache, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured rendering of the Barossa's classic red trio. Savory, peppery elements add welcome complexity to the nose, while the flavors fold in hints of molasses and plum, then end on a long, supple note. Drink now–2017."
Viognier,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,20.0,92.0,"An incredibly well-made and well-priced Viognier, from Cedarville's very own decomposed granite-filled soils high atop Fair Play. Opening with faint floral honey, wet stone and pear aromas, the flavors follow through accordingly, and the wine just continues to please with full-integrated minerality. It's a joy to drink."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Marangona,20.0,92.0,"Alluring aromas of white flower, orchard fruit and Mediterranean herb mingle in the glass. The delicious, linear palate offers a nice depth of flavors including juicy yellow peach, tart green apple, nectarine and a hint of ginger alongside tangy acidity. The lingering finish closes on a mineral note."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Adega Mãe,20.0,92.0,"This is a strongly tannic, obviously wood-aged wine. The black fruits are paralleled by the new-wood toastiness, which gives a vanilla flavor. With top Portuguese consultant Anselmo Mendes involved, the wine has style as well as weight and dense fruit. Give it several years to mature. Drink from 2017."
Viognier,US,California,Rock Wall,20.0,92.0,"Abundant flavors combine with a plush texture to make a wine that slowly builds interest from the first sniff to the lingering aftertaste. Hints of vanilla and honeysuckle enhance the vivid apricot flavors, lasting long on the viscous palate and through the finish."
Syrah,Chile,Limarí Valley,Viña Tabalí,20.0,92.0,"Boysenberry, cassis, woodsy spice and leathery aromas hit the right chords. This feels tight and juicy due to bright core acidity. A combination of spicy plum and red-berry aromas are intense and turn feral upon airing, while this limestone soil-based Syrah tastes of coffee, pepper, plum and various spices on a powerful finish. Drink through 2021."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,20.0,92.0,"This sparkling Vouvray has weight and richness, balanced by intense acidity and a crisp green-salad texture. Lemon zest and quince flavors add the fruit element. It will benefit from another two years in bottle."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Anthony Nappa,20.0,92.0,"A standout amid a number of excellent red wines from winemaker Anthony Nappa, this unoaked Cabernet Franc (made with indigenous yeast) shines a spotlight on Cabernet Franc's raw, somewhat vulnerable expression. It's unabashedly herbal and green, almost minty, yet simultaneously luscious and berried in flavor. It's fleshy in its suppleness, yet elegantly framed within a structure of taut tannins and acidity."
St. Laurent,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,20.0,92.0,"Intriguing notes of sandalwood and orange peel insinuate themselves on the pure red cherry fruit. The palate remains refreshingly slender, unadulterated and perfectly balanced. This is subtle and understated and thus allows the moody and mutable St. Laurent fruit to change its expression as constantly and quickly as stormy clouds."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,20.0,92.0,"Produced from Aveleda's Quinta da Aguieira, this is a blend of typical Portuguese white grapes with a dash of Chardonnay. From old vines, it has concentration and a rich texture that is cut by fragrant acidity. There is a ripe feel to this impressive wine, generous and full of fruit. Drink now."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Lamadrid,20.0,92.0,"A heady but attractive bouquet of marzipan, balsam wood, blackberry, cassis and raisin introduce a loaded but well-balanced, full-bodied palate. Toast, chocolate and black fruit flavors finish with additional spice, chocolate and lustiness. Drink through 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,Ledger David,20.0,92.0,"Fermented in stainless steel and one neutral barrel, this aromatic and compelling wine is clean, fresh and full of delicious fruit. Meyer lemon, satsuma orange and fresh pineapple are in the mix, with supporting acidity. Tasted a full day after being opened, it remained vivid and expressive."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,20.0,92.0,"This firm, powerful and structured wine is rich with tannins and dark fruits. Spice and wood flavors compete with the ground coffee and juicy fruitiness. A concentrated wine for the long-term, it needs to age, . Drink from 2017."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Antiquum Farm,20.0,92.0,"The less expensive of the winery's two Pinot Gris, this is in some respects the better wine. Excellent focus pulls crisp flavors of pear, lemon curd and flinty mineral into sharp resolution, and appealing minerality gives the acidity a resonant texture. It all resolves in a lovely, creamy finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Arsac,20.0,92.0,"Vines surround a garden full of contemporary sculpture in the grounds of the château. This wine, produced at the western end of the Margaux appellation, is well structured with firm tannins that are balanced by juicy berry fruits and acidity. It is well integrated, on the way to aging well. Drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Companhia das Quintas,20.0,92.0,"Huge and rich, this offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated structure. It's packed with a seemingly sweet blackberry flavor that serves as a counterpoint to the firm texture. With both density and a dark edge, this will age over several years."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Le Morette,20.0,92.0,"White spring-flower and ripe orchard-fruit aromas lead the way in this lovely white. Its creamy palate doles out juicy pear, ripe apple and honeydew melon flavors, while a blast of tangerine and bright acidity lift the finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Calavon,20.0,92.0,"The Audibert family estate, close to beautiful Aix-en-Provence, is now run organically. The wine, rich and with delicious ripe fruits, is full in the mouth, packed with red-berry flavors that are cut with red currants and lemon zest. It is a very fine wine, ready now."
Viognier,US,California,Terre Rouge,20.0,92.0,"A deep gold color and rich, tangerine and almond aromas meet pear-tart flavors and a creamy texture in this full-bodied but not over-the-top wine. The flavors and texture are pleasantly dense yet the wine is dry. This should age well, gaining complexity and interest through 2002."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Ponzi,20.0,92.0,"This outstanding effort offers a vanilla wrap around solid fruit flavors of white peach, yellow plum and nectarine. The texture and detail are delightful, as the wine generously fills in the finish with a hint of marzipan."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Zaca Mesa,20.0,92.0,"Ripe yellow apples and peach elements are cut with lime peels and cement aromas on this blend of 46% Roussanne, 44% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier. It's focused and clean upon sipping, with tight pears, nectarine and white peach flavors, even showing some crushed ant tension."
Chardonnay,US,California,Brophy Clark,20.0,92.0,"This is a very tastefully done take on a more traditional, rather ripe California style of the grape, with peach-driven tropicality, buttered vanilla and a salted-lemon element on the nose. The palate shows ripe nectarine, lemon curds, lime sorbet, a pinch of dill and a tiny bit of vanilla on the finish, proving lively throughout."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Mercy,20.0,92.0,"The grape's stereotypical green nose gets a whole new interpretation, with aromas of sunburned hay, bags of desiccated grass and wild oregano. The herbaceous characters carry the palate, but it's smooth with thyme and chile verde flavors, and a lingering bit of citrus tartness and tannic grip."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Kaiken,20.0,92.0,"This is opaque, offering a lush collection of black fruit aromas on what amounts to a deep, dense bouquet. Layered and displaying excellent size and texture, it has saturated, meaty black-fruit flavors along with toasty, integrated oak. A powerhouse Malbec and maybe the best Ultra to date."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Ponzi,20.0,92.0,"This is a limited-production wine made principally from 45-year-old vines. Dry, textural and complex, it mixes Key lime, tangerine, orange peel and citrus oil with a burnishing hint of Cointreau."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,20.0,92.0,"This is a solid and structured wine that is rich and full on the palate. With ripe tannins and black plum flavors, it is dense, packed with big, bold flavors and a velvety texture that is looking towards a long future. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,Australia,South Australia,Langmeil,20.0,92.0,"This is nearly equal parts Shiraz, Mataro and Grenache, full bodied and creamy in texture. Black cherries and peppery spice show up on the nose, while the palate adds brighter red raspberries, bass notes of ripe plums, sweet hints of brown sugar and savory, meaty complexity. Drink now–2020."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Haut Bourg,20.0,92.0,"Aged for 10 years in underground tanks on its lees, this wine has just been bottled. That aging process has preserved the wine's freshness, keeping the crisp acidity in place. So while the wine is beautifully mature, it is still so bright and fruity. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,20.0,92.0,"This white blend is two thirds Sémillon, one third Sauvignon Blanc. It has continued to improve from vintage to vintage, and this is the best yet. A Washington take on Bordeaux blanc, it's dry and fresh, with golden apple and sweet grain extending across the palate and on through a lingering, lightly peachy finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,Adega Mãe,20.0,92.0,"Perfumed floral and spice aromas give this wine its great character. It is a rich blend of Viosinho, Alvarinho and Chardonnay, ripe and full of spice, rounded apple and golden-plum flavors and cut with citrus acidity. This fine wine will be better from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Barra of Mendocino,20.0,92.0,"Concentrated earthy, meaty and spicy aromas precede layered, dense flavors of espresso, cassis and cherries as this full-bodied, velvety wine coats the palate and clings to the sides of the mouth. It has extraordinary depth, showing lavish but appropriate oak accents and a delicious lingering finish."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,20.0,92.0,"Although this wine is dry, it does have hints of the honeyed character that comes out of the Petit Manseng. With apple and fragrant acidity it has this edge of apricots and spice. Drink the wine now."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Wunsch & Mann,20.0,92.0,"Baked Cox apples with lemon juice are evoked by the fresh and appetizing nose on this wine. These flavors continue on the dry, juicy and refreshing palate, gathering hints of honey and cinnamon. Lithe and dry but full flavored, it finishes with pure lemon."
Vermentino,US,California,Uvaggio,20.0,92.0,Full body and powerfully fruity flavors make this sweet wine seem extra bold. It smells like toasted almonds and dried meat and tastes like poached peaches. A smooth but lively texture keeps the flavors zinging on the finish.
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,20.0,92.0,"Named after the 18th Russian Tsar, Peter the Great, this is serious, powerful wine. It's a powerhouse of ripe fruits, blackberries, dark plums and solid tannins. With a solid, firm background of wood and spice as well as acidity, it's concentrated and needing to age. Drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Magnum Vinhos,20.0,92.0,"This is a dark chocolate and licorice flavored wine with great tannins and minerality as well as black plum fruits. It is concentrated and powerful and still so young. Dense and brooding, it will need many more years to mature, so drink from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Bandeiras,20.0,92.0,"Almost black in color, this powerful wine from vines in the Douro Superior region is impressively ripe and concentrated. Dark tannins, brooding black plum flavors and a solid age worthy structure will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Rede,20.0,92.0,"This is a powerful ripe wine, packed with black fruits and firm tannins. It is an impressive blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz, rich with black-plum flavors, a dark texture and great structure. This is a wine to age. Drink from 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc-Assyrtiko,Greece,Drama,Ktima Pavlidis,20.0,92.0,"This blend starts with panache, offering aromas of vanilla cream, lemon, banana and crushed herbs. On the palate, it balances brisk acidity with alluring citrus and melon fruit flavors. The wine has a spicy spin that gives it extra spunk."
Pinot Blanc,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Anita und Hans,20.0,92.0,"Hazelnut and lemon can be sensed briefly on the nose. The palate adds bright lemon notes and riper notions of yellow Mirabelle plum, with an overall impression of freshness and stony depth on the midpalate texture. The finish is clean, dry and lasts long, with a pure lemon note."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,20.0,92.0,"One of the best sparkling wines to come from the Loire, this is a classically driven wine, packed with tingling acidity along with some toastiness and apple fruits. The wine is still fresh and could age a few more months in bottle."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle & Dr. Loosen,20.0,92.0,"Continuing a long-running streak of excellence, the latest vintage of Eroica blends fruit from vineyards in the Lake Chelan, Yakima Valley, Royal Slope and Horse Heaven Hills regions. It's a rich mix of peach and papaya, creamy and slightly sweet (16.6 g/L). The citrusy acids keep a fine edge on the lush flavors."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Château du Coudray Montpensier,20.0,92.0,"The latest vintage from this estate is still very young. It has typical stalky black fruits, layers of wood aging that give spice and dark toast and following acidity. As it balances, the stalkiness will subside to give a richly structured wine. Drink from 2019."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,20.0,92.0,"A wonderfully aromatic note of tangerine and orange peel appears first. The palate continues with the purity of ripe aromatic citrus flavors: there is zest and freshness on a slender, lively and bundled body that delivers a blast of tangy ripe citrus. The finish is clean, just off dry and almost addictive—you just have to take another sip."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Lucatoni,20.0,92.0,"Ripe blackberry and spice aromas are a touch meaty and earthy but mostly straightforward. A grabby, fleshy palate is obtuse but still balanced, while this tastes of berry and cassis, which are textbook flavors for Cabernet Sauvignon. A dry, woody finish with a chocolate note renders this better than most for $20."
Grenache,US,California,Babcock,20.0,92.0,"Extremely tight, clean and minerally aromas of chalk, citrus pith and lemongrass make for a very crisp and fresh nose on this white wine bottling of the typically red Grenache grape. The palate is just as zesty, with apple skin, green papaya and underripe mango flavors, showing flashes of tropicality while remaining light and tight."
St. Laurent,Austria,Burgenland,Artisan Wines DI Franz Scheider,20.0,92.0,"Wonderfully floral, brooding oak notes frame this inviting Sankt Laurent's red cherry fruit. On the palate, the oak comes across as vanilla, enwrapping the cherry fruit with richness. This is light on its feet but ripe and elegant with wonderful, lasting freshness."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Josef Bauer,20.0,92.0,"Friendly, lemony freshness plays on the nose and palate, where it's joined by spicy grapefruit peel notes. That zestiness pervades the taut, straight-lined and utterly refreshing palate. This is concentrated, clean and full of citrusy verve."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,20.0,92.0,"This is part of a series of wines named after the subsoil in which the vines are planted. The soil in this case is formed from igneous rocks. It gives a fine, pure wine that has great richness as well as fresh apple and pear flavors. The wine with just that extra few months aging is ready to drink."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,20.0,92.0,"An impressive, wood-aged wine, with great perfumes as well as structure. Rich, while very mineral, the wine has an intense, ageworthy texture that brings out dark plums, ripe berries and dark tannins. Keep this wine and drink from 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,20.0,92.0,"With six years' aging, this is a delicious, soft and mature wine. The fruit and acidity have been subsumed into a balsam and spice flavored wine, with a touch of mint and sweet chocolate. It is delicious now, not for aging further."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Penley Estate,20.0,92.0,"Full bodied and richly textured, this is an approachable wine that should nonetheless drink well through at least 2025. Toasted coconut accents cassis and blackberry fruit, folding in hints of vanilla on the long, mouthwatering finish."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Shannon Ridge,20.0,92.0,"Another good example of how Lake County grows excellent big reds. Delicious, rich, almost chocolaty, this nevertheless dry wine is packed with flavor. It's concentrated, very smooth despite massive tannins and just a pleasure to taste. Tempting now, but best after 2020."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Xanadu,20.0,92.0,"It's good to see this Margaret River stalwart return to the States. The 2015 DJL is a slightly nutty, toasty wine, plump and silky in texture. Pear, melon, vanilla and citrus notes finish long."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Cristom,20.0,92.0,"Lovely from the first sniff on, this is packed with mineral-drenched fruit flavors. Pear flesh and skin dominate, along with suggestions of cucumber and white melon. The leesy minerality is a great palate cleanser."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,François Baur,20.0,92.0,"Lifted, almost herbal citrus freshness dominates the nose, making for an inviting appetizing opening. The palate comes in with generous ripe pear fruit on a slender body. The flavors are boosted by some residual sweetness. The off-dry finish is of lasting, adorably brilliant, pure pear fruit."
Rosé,US,California,Terre Rouge,20.0,92.0,"Pretty and pink, this light-bodied but nervy wine brims with white raspberry and pomegranate flavors and a texture that is crisp and mouth-cleansing. The balance between fruitiness and acidity is precise and appetizing, so it pays off sip after sip. It was made from Grenache, Mourvèdre, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Darcie Kent Vineyards,20.0,92.0,"Bright and crisp, but with nice depth and length, too, this medium-bodied wine is delicious to drink and holds interest with a light touch of oak. Tangy grapefruit and lime flavors have a hint of brioche and the texture is very lively."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tenuta delle Terre Nere,20.0,92.0,"Delicate, attractive aromas of chamomile, pear and brimstone lead the nose on this graceful wine. The linear palate delivers green apple, juicy pear, savory herb and mineral alongside fresh acidity. It's linear, vertical and elegant. Hold for complexity. Drink 2015–2020."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Anita und Hans,20.0,92.0,"The white pepper of Blaufränkisch is joined here by rounder spices of oak. The fruit is ripe but not plump, everything is in balance and makes for a refreshing yet rich red, dense with blueberry and black cherry flavors. There is energy and drive and no heaviness at all. This is full of life."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Zaca Mesa,20.0,92.0,"This blend of 53% Mourvèdre, 42% Grenache and 5% Cinsault mixes up fresh raspberry fruit aromas with mint, light licorice, charred meats, white pepper, lavender and bouquet garni. The palate centers on strawberry and raspberry, balanced by plum-peel tannins and seasoned with sage, anise and chaparral herbs. It's a very versatile Rhône blend."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,20.0,92.0,"This rich, smoke- and wood-flavored wine shows great potential. It also has plenty of black fruits that give it a ripe full character. The spice from wood aging is still right up front and needs time to settle down to become a dense, balanced wine with fruit and structure all in place. Drink from 2019."
White Blend,US,California,Locations,20.0,92.0,"Lush and full in texture, this wine has more spicy flavors than fruity ones, as a blend of vanilla, hazelnut and cream coat the palate. It has the rich feel of barrel fermentation and will win friends with the layering of subtleties on such a decadent mouthfeel."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Rede,20.0,92.0,"This is an impressive, rich wood-aged wine. It is generous and full in the mouth and packed with ripe peach and apricot flavors. There is a depth to the wine coming from barrel fermentation that has given it richness. Nutmeg flavors are matched with toastiness to the give this ripe wine extra complexity. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Jules Taylor,20.0,92.0,"Most barrel-fermented Marlborough Sauvignons will set you back close to twice as much, making this a bargain. Awesomely pungent and smoky aromas leap from the glass, followed by complex flavors that range from saline to pink grapefruit and stone fruit. Drink this full-bodied, silky-textured wine over the next year or two."
Chardonnay,US,California,Mount Eden Vineyards,20.0,92.0,"This offers good quality for the price from this historic producer, which heads south to this dry-farmed vineyard planted in 1976. The wine shows lots of lemon scents, from blossoms to peels, along with browned butter, sea salt and smoke. The palate offers singed lime peels, red grapefruit skin, iodine and sour yellow apple peels, proving quite complex."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Eisenberg,Jalits,20.0,92.0,"The nose is still closed and shy, while the palate speaks of ripe but tart cherry and blueberry fruit, coralled into a fine, firm tannic structure. Inherent freshness makes this wine bright and bold, lending precision and promise. The wine needs to mellow but all is there: fruit and firmness, tone and brightness. Crunchy and lovely right now, this will relax soon. Drink 2018–2025."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Le Casematte,20.0,92.0,"This blend of 70% Nerello Mascalese and 30% Nocera offers ripe red-skinned berry, violet and Mediterranean scrub aromas. The juicy, vibrant palate doles out crushed raspberry, red cherry, almond and citrus zest notes with bright acidity and refined tannins. Enjoy through 2025."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de Tiregand,20.0,92.0,"A big and dense wine, with tannins that are well integrated into its core of solid black plum and cherry flavors, and a bitter chocolate note that comes from wood aging. With all of its concentration, this wine should age for five years."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Jean Sipp,20.0,92.0,"Beautifully evocative notes of apricot and peach compote appear first. They are joined by blossom honey and a floral touch that fully flourishes on the palate. They are joined by fresh, lively and spicy pink grapefruit and spice. This is full-on bursting with fruit flavors but still manages to balance its exuberance with lovely, illuminating freshness."
Red Blend,US,California,Omen,20.0,92.0,"This deep, dark and concentrated wine made by Alexandre Remy is big in every way—from the almost-black color to amped up aromas of dark chocolate and blackberry jam. Ripe blueberry and blackberry flavors coat the palate while a thick layer of soft-edged tannins shape the texture. It's not at all shy, and is a blast to drink with something grilled over open flames."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta dos Avidagos,20.0,92.0,"This is a rich wine from a great Douro Port vintage. It has the structure and density that came with the year, showcasing rich black fruits and dark tannins. The 12 months of wood-aging has tamed its wild fruitiness and resulted in a stylish wine that wears its high alcohol well. Drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Magnum Vinhos,20.0,92.0,"A classic blend of Dão grapes, including Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional, this is a generous, full wine that balances a firm, mineral texture with ripe plum and damson fruits. Wood aging has given an extra dimension to its broad opulence. Drink from 2018."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Burgenland,Kracher,20.0,92.0,"Both the juicy and the tart notes of ripe apple and freshly cut apple peel play on the nose. The palate follows with balanced, gentle sweetness: a play-off between apple ripeness and apple tartness. The notion is crisp and the body generous. The finish is delicate and the wine seems just off dry, although it is a proper late-harvest style. It would be an absolute winner with soft cheeses."
Assyrtico,Greece,Retsina,Kechris,20.0,92.0,"This 100% Assyrtiko Retsina shows the versatility of this variety and will challenge the modern wine drinker's perception of the traditional pour. Intense aromas of lime and lemon mingle with a spin of crushed thyme, honey and vanilla. On the palate, vibrant fruit and a flinty minerality prevail. The wine finishes long and clean. Pair with fatty fish like lobster or fried sardines."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Jasper Sisco,20.0,92.0,"This has the concentration and sappy intensity of a late-harvest wine, though it's closer to dry than to off dry. It's borderline unctuous, with lush tropical, stone and citrus fruits all mixed together. Meyer lemon, peach and papaya stand out, with a smooth finish that adds candied pineapple to the party."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,20.0,92.0,"Less effusive on the nose than the Mort's Block, this boasts notes of tangerine zest and lemon. This dry, medium-bodied Riesling hints at riper fruit flavors yet stays resolutely citrusy through the long, electric finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,20.0,92.0,"A blend of northern and southern Portuguese grapes, this is a seriously firm wine that's structured and dense. Spiced black plums are layered with big, drying tannins and acidity, which promise long aging for this impressive wine. Drink from 2017."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Estremadura,Companhia das Quintas,20.0,92.0,"A brooding, powerful wine, concentrating perfumed fruit with black berry juice and dark tannins. It does have acidity to balance all the power and richness, but this is a big, solid wine with density of flavor."
Riesling,US,New York,Boundary Breaks,20.0,92.0,"Boundary Breaks has proven to be the break-out producer of the Finger Lakes this year with an excellent line up of wines, and this off-dry wine is amongst its best. Elegantly perfumed with notes of fresh green florals and herbs, it builds in power and expression on the palate with pristine white peach flavors pierced with lime acidity and a reverberating mineral finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lynmar,20.0,92.0,"This is a classically light rosé, fragrant in strawberry and raspberry. Traces of pomegranate on the back palate offers darker, riper fruit in the glass, getting prettier as it goes along. Deliciously dry and dancing in acidity, it has plenty of citrus on the finish. The wine is substantial enough for springtime and summertime meals, but will drink equally well on its own."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine D'en Ségur,20.0,92.0,"Situated in the Tarn River valley, south of Cahors and west of Toulouse, this estate has turned towards Bordeaux in its choice of grapes. The wine has structure, tense tannins as well as black currant fruit flavors. It's a rich, generous wine, and with its acidity and firm background it will age. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Forstreiter,19.0,92.0,A touch of passion fruit haunts the nose. The palate is juicy with mirabelle plums and lively lemon and orange notes. There is zesty textured concentration and a wonderful purity of flavor. This is exciting and has lots of drive with a lip-smacking finish.
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Andreola,19.0,92.0,"Fresh and balanced, this bright savory sparkler delivers mouthfuls of green apple, white peach and lemon peel. Crisp acidity keeps it refreshing while a soft mousse gives it plenty of finesse. It has a dry juicy finish."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Château du Coudray Montpensier,19.0,92.0,"A structured, ageworthy wine that has fragrant, smoky black currant fruits, layered with firm tannins. It is finely balanced, elegant, its acidity just the right balance to the developing rich fruits. For aging over 3–4 years."
Riesling,Austria,Wagram,Leth,19.0,92.0,"Slender and pure, lemony and tight, yet fruitful and cushioned. While riper years often bring heft to Rieslings from Wagram, the rich loess soils here have rounded out a slender year. Notions of cologne via citrus foliage and heady conifer show themselves with time in glass. A slender but perfectly balanced beauty."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Chambert,19.0,92.0,"Black in color, this dense wine has power, concentration and a hugely tannic structure. Still in its infancy, it is darkly dominated by its dry, firm texture, the black fruits still hiding behind the framework and the acidity. Give this complex wine until 2018 before drinking."
Viognier,US,Washington,Nefarious,19.0,92.0,"This is a juicy, perfect melding of citrus and light tropical fruit flavors. With impeccable balance and poise, this thrilling, entirely stainless-steel-fermented Viognier persists well onto the graceful finish."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Alexandre Monmousseau,19.0,92.0,"A dry Vouvray, crisp and rich, this brings out all the complexity of Chenin Blanc. Nuts, yellow fruits and green apple flavors are well integrated and balanced. A light spice aftertaste gives an exotic finish. Drink now, or age until 2018."
Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,19.0,92.0,"This little gem is sourced entirely from the Klipsun Vineyard, and it's the sort of wine that will wake up the sleepiest palate. A mass of fig, honeycomb, lemon rind and pith, it has wonderful focus, balance, length and concentration."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Cartuxa,19.0,92.0,"A powerful expression of rich red fruit, smoothed by wood aging and nearly four years in bottle. It has layers of acidity, spice, soft tannins and flavors of maturing fruit. It is ready to drink now but worth aging as well."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Barrister,19.0,92.0,"An excellent follow-up to the luscious 2010, this features a generous array of melon, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is noticeable residual sugar—much in the style of the Sancerres from French producer Cotat—but at one-third the cost."
Viognier,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,19.0,92.0,"Yalumba's mastery of Viognier extends even to this botrytis-affected dessert style, which offers scents and flavors of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's not overly complex, but wonderfully concentrated yet balanced, with a long, honeyed finish. Drink it over the next few years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château les Tonnelles,19.0,92.0,"A rustic wine, with definite barnyard flavors. The fruit has some smoky extract, but the tannins and old wood tastes intrude too much."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaines Vinet,19.0,92.0,"With the extra years of aging, this wine has smoothed itself out. It has lost that instant freshness of a young Muscadet and gained riper yellow and spice flavors that give it a full, rich character. There's just the right amount of acidity at the end to finish on a crisp note. Drink now."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,Basilisco,19.0,92.0,"Truffle, blackberry, dark spice, dark chocolate and new-leather aromas take center stage on this delicious full-bodied red. The smooth, enveloping palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, ripe plum, vanilla and a confectionery note framed in velvety tannins. It's structured but also remarkably easy drinking and a fantastic value. Drink through 2022."
Agiorgitiko,Greece,Nemea,Nasiakos,19.0,92.0,"Cedar, violet and red forest fruit aromas start this complex and stately red. On the palate, cherry, plum and pepper prevail. A classic wine with potential in the cellar."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta Villa Trasqua,19.0,92.0,"Delicate scents of violet, iris, woodland berry and baking spice abound on this firmly structured red. Made with 95% Sangiovese, the remaining 5% is Colorino and Malvasia Nera. The smooth palate doles out Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and a hint of chopped herb while a backbone of velvety tannins provides the framework. Drink through 2016."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Keuka Spring,19.0,92.0,"Keuka Spring Vineyards staged a remarkable renewal recently by introducing August Deimel, increasingly one of the Finger Lakes most promising young winemakers, as its head winemaker. This delightfully brisk Cabernet Franc showcases the crispness of sweet-tart black plums and cherries swathed in a finery of fresh, green herbs. It's deeply concentrated with black fruit flavors, yet elegant and refined, finishing long on a flurry of feathery tannins."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Uwe Schiefer,19.0,92.0,"Heady notes of freshly milled white pepper meet with smoky blueberries on the nose. The white pepper theme deliciously also pervades the concentrated but svelte palate. This is unmistakeably classy and sleek. There is an exciting, enlivening energy at the core of this wine; you want to sip more just to get to the bottom of it."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,19.0,92.0,"The lovely wines from this pioneering estate, now in the capable hands of second-generation winemaker Jason Lett, are generally priced well below any comparable efforts. Here the texture and minerality evoke surpassing elegance. Lime, grapefruit, a bite of pineapple all come into play, with the depth and balance that suggests several years of life ahead."
Spätburgunder,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,19.0,92.0,"Amidst a stunning line up of 2012 Spätburgunder, even Thörle's ready-to-drink, entry-level bottling offers remarkable elegance and power. The palate is succulent and ripe, bursting of black cherry and plum flavors. Nuanced tones of herb and smoky mineral lend depth and complexity. It's an approachable yet very sophisticated wine."
Riesling,US,New York,Boundary Breaks,19.0,92.0,"Honeysuckle and orange blossoms perfume this bright, ebullient wine full of ripe grapefruit and pineapple flavors. While dry in style, it juxtaposes a lusciously rich, penetrating palate against a pulsating backbone of lemon-line acidity. It's pristine yet powerful through a long, undulating finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lemelson,19.0,92.0,"This perfumed wine is a superb expression of Oregon Pinot Gris, and the best Tikka's ever from Lemelson. Apples, oranges and ripe melons fill the fruit bowl, bright and luscious and accented with perfectly proportioned barrel notes of toasted coconut and almond."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Pinto,19.0,92.0,"This is a powerful, ripe and intense wine. It has layers of juicy black fruits that are sustained by acidity and even more by the dense dusty tannins. It is structured and firm with the wood aging giving spice. Drink this fine wine from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,19.0,92.0,"An aromatic touch of ivy plays alongside green pear on the nose. These aromas continue on the palate where they acquire a zesty, fresh edge reminiscent of grapefruit. A note of pepper joins on the slender, dry body. This is aromatic, light and very refreshing, with an invigorating, lip-smacking finish."
Marsanne,France,Rhône Valley,Château du Trignon,19.0,92.0,"In any given year, one or the other of Trignon's varietal cuvées excels, and 2013 is a Marsanne year. The delicate aromas of white pepper and spring blossoms immediately intrigue, and the flavors don't disappoint. This wine is floral, spicy and fruity all at once, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Véronique Günther-Chereau,19.0,92.0,"This beautiful apricot and melon-flavored wine is still so fruity. It shows no sign of its seven years' aging, still keeping a fresh crisp character. There is just this extra depth and richness that brings in almond, spice and a touch of toastiness. Drink this very fine wine now."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Rubus,19.0,92.0,"Rubus is a label for wines selected by the fine American importer Fran Kysela, MS. The 2013 is a full-bodied, velvety-textured Barossa Shiraz, offering a rich, luxurious mouthfeel. Cedar and mocha notes are apparent, but there's ample underlying plummy fruit and a long, plush finish. Drink now–2020."
Zierfandler,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,19.0,92.0,"The scent of russet-pear peel on the nose is both pure and earthy. The palate shows a rounded texture despite the toned muscle of the wine. There is real concentration here, characterized by flavors of ripe pear and ripe citrus that bring lively juiciness to the palate. Texture and flavor draw you in, and the finish is pure and long."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,19.0,92.0,"While dry and impeccably elegant, this buoyantly perfumed Riesling balances subtle notes of honeysuckle and bees wax against a backdrop of luscious, mango, pineapple and peach flavors. The palate is satisfying and supple yet balanced by a sheen of lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long with a savory flick of pollen."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Longoria,19.0,92.0,"Nectarine, apricot, jasmine blossoms and lots of fresh squeezed Meyer lemon juice makes a delicious nose on this refreshing treat of a wine. It conveys lively, citrusy acidity and apple-rind tartness, offering flavors that last throughout the sip and deep into the finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Other,Chaltén,19.0,92.0,"This is one of the top Malbecs from Neuquén and it's under $20. The bouquet is focused, dark and loaded with inky berry aromas and graphite. The palate is deep and layered, and full bodied, with blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors. A long, spicy, toasty finish is warming but not hot. Drink through 2017."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Caves da Montanha,19.0,92.0,"This honeyed wine is ripe and beautifully rich. With apricot and sweet melon flavors that are touched by the wood aging, it has both great fruit and a fine mineral texture. Vines in the heart of the Dão region produce this very fine wine that is now ready to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Lackner Tinnacher,19.0,92.0,Beautifully fragrant and rounded Sauvignon Blanc flavors of cut grass and green banana are tempered by richer yeast notes. The palate shows a similar balance but crisp citrus flavors and tingling freshness give extra tone. This is elegant and made for the table.
Zinfandel,US,California,Carol Shelton,19.0,92.0,"Not overly full-bodied, not overly ripe, not overly wild, but just right for dinner time. It's well balanced, velvet textured and multilayered. Brambly, bright raspberry and blackberry flavors fill the mouth, supported by smooth tannins and good acidity that keep it lively and appetizing through the long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Silver Lake,19.0,92.0,"This low-alcohol (10.4%) dessert wine, finished with 11% residual sugar, is absolutely spot-on. Layers of textural detail amplify the concentrated core of lemon drop and candied orange, and an orange pekoe tea character adds still more flavor interest through the finish."
Chardonnay,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,19.0,92.0,"The chalk soil of the Cova da Ursa vineyard, high up on the Azeitão mountains, yields this rich, tropical-fruited Chardonnay. It is ripe with apricot and mango flavors that are smoothed out by the wood aging. Toast and fresh acidity are still balancing out, so this impressive wine needs to age. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Burgenland,Meinklang,19.0,92.0,"Floral hints on the nose give way on the palate to a deep, concentrated core of forest fruit: there is the tartness of wild cranberry, the alluring aroma of wild raspberry and darker overtones of bilberry, all framed by brooding aspects of oak. Fruit and oak are in some kind of chiaroscuro dialogue that intrigues. Best to wait a little longer since real pleasure and elegance awaits."
Chardonnay,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Muzic,19.0,92.0,"This gorgeous white opens with scents suggesting white flower, orchard fruit, lemon pastry and a whiff of wet stone. The creamy palate delivers yellow apple, lemon zest, bitter almond and a savory mineral note. It's supremely elegant and surprisingly fresh for the vintage."
White Blend,US,California,Conclusion,19.0,92.0,"This small production blend of 90% Viognier and 10% Sauvignon Blanc leads with fragrant, inviting floral qualities and well-defined layers of peach and apricot fruit. Light and bright, it's balanced, focused and utterly delicious."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher,19.0,92.0,"A touch of pepper accentuates the fresh notion of wet stone and citrus on the nose. The palate is bone dry and has a fresh fizzing mousse that accentuates, stone, pepper and green citrus even more. The slightly austere, bone-dry style will come into its own with other pure restrained flavors—think subtle Japanese dishes. The finish is brisk and superclean."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Ruby Hill Winery,19.0,92.0,"This big wine has everything required of the variety and more. It starts with vivid citrus, herb and melon aromas, then lays on ripe white peach, honeydew and mineral notes that fill out the palate and lend mouthfilling texture. Layering, complexity and diverse flavors make it special."
White Blend,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,19.0,92.0,"d'Arenberg has a quartet of sweet wines from 2008, and this blend of Viognier, Pinot Gris and Marsanne represents a terrific value. It's syrupy sweet, redolent of honey-drizzled, spiced poached pears. To quibble, it could be a touch more complex and crisp, but it is still a succulent mouthful of dessert wine for drinking over the next few years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Starmont,19.0,92.0,"Sourced from the Stanly Ranch Vineyard, among other sites, this 100% varietal wine is light pink-orange in hue, and citrus-driven in flavor. Cherry and strawberry notes complement the lemon and grapefruit, delivering a refreshingly lengthy zip of acidity."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,19.0,92.0,"Fresh lime and ivy hits you first, followed by a leesy hint and some pear on the nose. The palate comes in with salty savoriness that suggests yeasty miso, chervil and lovage, with lots of white pepper accented by a little spritz. Brightened by fresh lemon notes, this makes for a spicy, elegant and slender wine with a light touch and real depth."
Malbec,Chile,Marchigue,Viña Bisquertt,19.0,92.0,"This full-bodied Malbec out-performs its price. Ripe blackberry and pencil aromas set up a dense, tight, structured palate with focused, drilling flavors of blackberry and licorice. If you like layered, full-fruit reds with balance and harmony, this is it."
Shiraz,India,Nashik,Sula,19.0,92.0,"Deep garnet in the glass, this wine has a nose of blackberry and roasting meat. It offers a sophisticated mélange of flavors, in particular ripe red cherry, smoke, roasting meat, cranberry and light spice with a hint of brambles. It is very bright on entry, but tannins sneak up and then linger on the gums beyond a smooth finish that is punctuated by a touch of smoke."
Zierfandler,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,19.0,92.0,"Very faint peach notes break through the lemony freshness of this slender, golden wine. The usually richer, more sumptuous nature of Zierfandler shines through on the textured palate and in the glimpses of generous oiliness that flank the edges of the central citrus focus. This is lovely now but will reward cellaring. The finish is poised and clean-cut, lemony and long."
Chardonnay,US,California,Alma Rosa,19.0,92.0,"This bottling by pioneer Richard Sanford is much more widely available, affordable and stylistically accessible right now than the single vineyard option. It's delicate on the nose with bright lime spritz, Meyer lemon pith, crushed lemon verbena and a grippy brie cheese rind component, then proves tangy on the nuanced palate, with lemongrass and pomelo skin meshing into nectarine and apple flesh."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,19.0,92.0,"A heady, minty nose is joined by fuller fruit of green and yellow pear. On the palate, highlights of pepper appear amidst lemon and grapefruit peel. This is sleek and slender, with wonderfully zesty concentration and brisk freshness. Take your time drinking this, there is a lot going on."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Prieler,19.0,92.0,A dark and brooding aspect of smoke hangs over the black cherry fruit. This is still a little closed but the palate reveals elegance and concentration and wonderfully palpable chiffon tannins. This is fresh and has pure focus with some hints of iron oxide and a slight dusting of pepper: a wine of great charm.
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Marangona,19.0,92.0,This polished wine opens with delicate white floral aromas and hints of stone fruit. The savory but elegant palate delivers white peach and lemon accented with almond and mineral notes. It's a subtle wine that shows true elegance.
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Gaudrelle,19.0,92.0,"This wine is rich with smooth ripe fruit that give the impression that it is off dry. In fact, it is the intensity of the fruit that is the driving force behind the wine. With acidity strongly in the background, there is a crisp element to this fine lemon and apricot-flavored wine. Drink from 2019."
Viognier,Australia,Victoria,Tahbilk,19.0,92.0,"This winery is better known for its Marsanne, but this Viognier is an excellent value. It exudes hints of apricot, pineapple, ginger and honey, coming across rich and creamy on the palate. Despite the heft, it finishes long, framed by mouthwatering acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Gainey,19.0,92.0,"There is a very accessible aromatic entry to this bottling. An almost-sweet touch of crystallized honey and beeswax is cut by green plum, wet stone and chopped lemongrass. The sip delivers rounded and pleasant flavors of nectarine, red apple and chamomile."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Secret Spot Wines,19.0,92.0,"Aged in wood for up to 14 months, this wine is rich and smooth. Produced from low-yielding old vines, it's a field blend of many different varieties. It is ripe with layers of black currant and spice flavors along with acidity. The wine has weight but remains stylish. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,92.0,"Most of the estate vines used for this blend date back to the mid-1970s. It emphasizes bright citrus flavors, like lemon and lime, with lemon verbena, cilantro and other fresh herb notes that add detail to the finish. A very fine value, it can also age for a decade or longer."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello della Paneretta,19.0,92.0,"This is a textbook Chianti Classico, with dark berry and plum aromas accented by hints vanilla and clove. The palate boasts a core of wild cherry flavors layered with balsamic herbs. Still tightly tannic, it needs a few more years to unwind."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Tangley Oaks,19.0,92.0,"Tasted blind among wines priced three times higher, this Pinot more than held its own. Vibrant, well-balanced and medium-bodied, it blends generous fruit flavors, moderate tannins and restrained oak spice. It's elegant, mouthwatering and subtle, lingering long into the finish."
Caprettone,Italy,Southern Italy,Cantine Olivella,19.0,92.0,"Made from native grape Caprettone, this savory wine beckons with inviting fragrances of white flowers, nuts, yellow apple, citrus and flint. The focused palate delivers nectarine, lemon zest, pear, mint and mineral accented with Mediterranean herbs. Crisp acidity gives a refreshing finish. Vinity Wine, Panebianco."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Vettori,19.0,92.0,"Fragrant and refined, this opens with scents of white spring flowers and just picked orchard fruit. The bright, creamy palate doles out green apple, pear, white peach and a hint of chopped herbs. Bright acidity lifts the juicy flavors while a soft mousse lends elegance. It closes on an almond note."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Thorn Clarke,18.0,92.0,"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5–8 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering."
Teroldego,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,92.0,"Super-concentrated and intense, this starts with a very deep color and aromas like espresso and smoked meat. Flavors suggest black cherry and cranberry shaded with spices. An earthy, savory thread runs through all the dark fruit and spices, lingering on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Woodinville Wine Cellars,18.0,92.0,"A terrific wine, with a crisp, clean, classic nose of pure, crystalline Sauvignon Blanc. Done in all stainless, sourced from Artz (Red Mountain) and Stillwater Creek (Ancient Lakes), this riot of melon, citrus, apple and sweet hay is just about perfect, with lovely natural acidity."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Le Casematte,18.0,92.0,"Made with native grapes Nerello Mascalese and Nocera, this bright wine delivers aromas of perfumed berry, blue flower and a whiff of cake spice. The sleek palate delivers wild cherry, crushed strawberry, clove, cinnamon, orange peel and thyme alongside firm, polished tannins. It finishes on a mineral note. Drink through 2018."
Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,France,Loire Valley,Bouvet-Ladubay,18.0,92.0,"Wood aged during fermentation, this rich generous wine is the top cuvée from this major Saumur producer. It is rich with apple and citrus flavors backed by a touch of toastiness. The wine is towards dry with a touch of spice at the end. Drink this fine wine now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,18.0,92.0,"DFJ Vinhos manages this 16th century property which has produced a now mature wine. It has great balance, the berry fruits moving to secondary flavors of spice, smokiness, sweet tannins and hints of toast. It's ready to drink, but will continue to develop through 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Artezin,18.0,92.0,"“Wow” is the first word that comes to mind when tasting this superconcentrated and immensely fruity wine. It practically overwhelms the nose and the palate with ripe, jammy boysenberry and blackberry, sprinkled with licorice and black-pepper nuances that add attractive complexity. It's a big wine all the way, but not extreme in alcohol."
Lambrusco di Sorbara,Italy,Central Italy,Cavicchioli,18.0,92.0,"Fragrant and loaded with finesse, this boasts enticing blue flower, wild berry and cake spice scents. The fresh, elegant palate evokes strawberry, raspberry, candied nectarine and ginger, the flavors framed by vibrant acidity. It finishes crisp and dry."
Port,Portugal,Port,Quarles Harris,18.0,92.0,"This is a rich, smooth wine that has ripe fruit and plenty of smooth plum flavors. It has some spice, balanced acidity and a fine dense texture. The wine, with its fresh aftertaste is ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,US,Washington,pb,18.0,92.0,"A dry, late-harvest wine from 20-year-old vines. Floral with a subtle honey note, more like pollen; lemon and orange candy, sleek and deep."
Rosé,US,California,Onesta,18.0,92.0,"Onesta is Jillian Johnson's debut of her own wines; she previously made Cinsault-based reds and rosés for the Phoenix Ranch brand. She is not new, however, to the indelible Bechthold Vineyard and its ancient Cinsault grapes, and her passion and expertise with the site shows gorgeously here. Orange-pink in hue, this beauty shares notes of crushed strawberry that are perfectly in balance with its dry, elegant point-of-view. Sip this one all night long, with food or without."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Bethel Heights,18.0,92.0,"This estate-grown offering was a standout among several dozen tasted for a feature story. It's loaded with bright fruit flavors of grapefruit and pear, and even in the warm 2012 vintage, it maintains the grape's signature minerality, while moving gracefully into a detailed, focused finish."
Riesling,US,Washington,Gamache,18.0,92.0,"A leesy, textural, racy and refreshing Riesling, this is loaded with lime, grapefruit and melon flavors. There is a streak of gin-like botanicals as well, and a rich, resonant finish."
Syrah,US,California,Bianchi,18.0,92.0,"Caramelized black plum, teriyaki, pepper and graphite scents combine for a rich, nuanced and inviting nose on this bottling. There is beefy depth to the palate, suggesting roasted meat, hoisin sauce, plum, dried herbs and peppercorn, all unfolding in layers."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Joey Tensley,18.0,92.0,"This blend is part of a new label for Syrah master Joey Tensley, and it's actually far more accessible at this young age than his more expensive bottlings. Fascinating aromas of game, animal hide and tar meet with black currant and elderberry on the nose. There is a strong density and tannic frame to the palate, where flavors of bay leaf, thyme and pepper spice up the undercurrent of elderberry and black plum skins."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,18.0,92.0,"Selected fruit and longer barrel aging are the hallmarks of this Reserva. With its bright mint flavors, well integrated into the firm tannins and plum skin fruits, this is a wine ready to age."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,DFJ Vinhos,18.0,92.0,"Want dense tannins? Then this your wine. Of course, it has much more than that. It has mineral-driven stone fruit flavors, a sense of terroir, of restrained power. It also has a serious side, and definite aging potential."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Lauren Ashton Cellars,18.0,92.0,"The Sangiovese comes from Red Willow Vineyard, and it would be hard to find a more lovely, elegant rosé from this side of the Atlantic. Light strawberry and melon aromas continue onto the palate, with pinpoint detail and precision."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Easton,18.0,92.0,"This crisp white is inviting and dry, with aromas of citrus, fig and fennel. Reminiscent of a fine Sancerre, it's finely structured, steely and still lushly textured and full enough in the mouth to enjoy with seafood, a creamy goat cheese salad or entirely on its own."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Branco,18.0,92.0,"A serious, dense wine that impresses with its elegant structure and rich fruit. The wine has an austere mineral feel that contrasts with its black-currant flavors, and its ripe, juicy character."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Penner-Ash,18.0,92.0,"Outstanding, with a honeyed note that suggests a hint of botrytis. A lovely blending of complex fruits, perfectly set against the acids and residual sugar just over one percent. This resonates beautifully."
White Blend,US,California,The Girls in the Vineyard,18.0,92.0,"Made from a single vineyard, this wine is both tasty and complex enough to stimulate the imagination. It smells like butter and cream, and tastes like ripe pear, toasted almonds and vanilla bean. Luscious yet a bit crisp, the texture feels great on the palate. Grenache Blanc, Piquepoul Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier all contributed."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,18.0,92.0,"Always a dense and concentrated wine, this new vintage also reveal rich fruit, blackberry and plum. Combined with dark tannins and layers of spice from wood aging, it's a structured wine that finishes with fresh, fruity acidity. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Efeste,18.0,92.0,"Fermented with wild yeast in neutral French oak barrels, this Evergreen Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc opens with a burst of peppery citrus fruit, almost Grüner-like. That spicy note persists throughout the long, sweetly herbal flavor set, blending lemon and lime, pineapple and grapefruit in a harmonious, lively and palate-cleansing crescendo."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Ancient Peaks,18.0,92.0,"Coming from a vineyard first planted by Mondavi in the late 1990s, this well-priced and widely available wine shows blackberry, violets, black pepper and just snapped dark chocolate on the nose. Fresh, lively black cherries and blueberries meld with fennel, tarragon and lots of herbal spice, all held together by smooth tannins."
Syrah,US,California,Andrew Murray,18.0,92.0,"Showing incredible depth for such an affordable wine, Andrew Murray does it again with this widely available bottling. The gamy nose shows lamb, rosemary, uncracked peppercorns, light tobacco leaf, soy sauce and a touch of tar. Purple flowers rule the palate, with lavender, violet and blossoming rosemary notes, with thyme and white pepper spicing up boysenberry fruit."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Michael David,18.0,92.0,"Battalion­s of tannin accompany ripe fruit flavors in this bold, full-bodied wine made from Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot. A supportive wrap of astringency from layers of fine tannin bolsters the rich blackberry and blueberry flavors, while flashy, spicy, smoky, new-oak accents infuse everything from the aroma to the finish."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,ColleStefano,18.0,92.0,"From one of the top estates in the Matelica denomination and made from organically farmed grapes, this stunning wine offers a beautiful bouquet of acacia flowers, beeswax and stone fruit. The palate delivers flavors of creamy white peach, apricot and pear, all accented by aromatic herbs and mineral tones. Delicious now, with crisp acidity, this will develop complexity over the next few years."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Tenuta Roveglia,18.0,92.0,"Enticing scents of fragrant white flower, stone fruit and crushed herb lead the way while the creamy, savory palate doles out white peach, mature yellow apple and tangerine zest. A blast of mineral energy lifts the lingering finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Marsau,18.0,92.0,"This special selection, tight-cropped from 30 acres of 100% Merlot, is ripe and rich. This is a smoky and fruity wine, in barrel for 14 months. It has ripe black fruits and rich, dense structure. Spice and toast balance the fruit, giving an impressive sense of generosity. Drink from 2017."
Grenache,US,California,Curran,18.0,92.0,"A stunner of a rosé, this wine's pale pink hue does little to indicate its action-packed reality. Nectarine, wet stone, and bubble gum occupy the aroma profile, but the flavors are what set it off. Ruby red grapefruit, strawberry shortcake, and a slight lemon chiffon element hammer home this beauty by Sta. Rita Hills-based superstar producer Kris Curran, formerly of both Sea Smoke and Foley. This is versatile enough to handle both seared scallops and grilled babyback pork ribs."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Alta Maria,18.0,92.0,"The intriguing golden-pink color looks like sun shining through a rose petal, and the aromas of honey, buttered popcorn and pecan pie are just as appealing. Once sipped, the flavors of poached salmon somehow show. These continue into a long finish, although the acidity soon wipes the slate clean like a good rosé should. This is one of many wines made by ninth-generation Santa Maria Valleyite James Ontiveros."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade de São Miguel,18.0,92.0,"Serious wood aging has given this concentrated wine power and great aging potential. For now, it is firmly tannic, but rich black fruit tones and juicy acidity are there, waiting to develop. It will be an impressive wine after 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Easton,18.0,92.0,"This standout wine has enticing herb and mineral aromas, plus rich, unorthodox flavors that resemble fresh fennel bulb and crisp white peach along with racy acidity and a good, substantial mouthfeel. It tastes concentrated, though not overly full bodied, but most of all it has a memorable personality."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,92.0,"This is a powerful wine, perfumed and ripe. Its aromas come from the Touriga Nacional in the blend that also includes Syrah and Alicante Bouschet. It's a dark and dense wine, very rich with enough juicy black fruit to balance. The concentration and tannins suggest long aging, so don't drink before 2019."
Red Blend,US,California,Bogle,18.0,92.0,"Pure and delicious, this generous, lightly spicy and velvet-textured wine does a great job of combining ripe, tasty fruit flavors with an enticing oaky layer that seems to bring subtle sweetness. While full bodied it is not heavy, and has firm, fine-grained tannins to add texture."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Yamhill Valley,18.0,92.0,"A delicious and compelling Riesling that intrigues from the get-go with soft aromas of rose petals, tea and honey. It's a sweet wine, but impeccably balanced with juicy natural acidity, so the tension is perfect and balanced. This is Oregon Riesling at its Germanic finest."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,18.0,92.0,"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc. Here is the same mix of racy, bracing tropical and stone fruit flavors, nicely matched to toasty flavors of almonds and biscuits. Elegant, detailed and ripe, yet clearly varietal, this is a beautiful, seductive example of barrel-fermented Washington Sauvignon Blanc."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Vinícola Hidalgo,18.0,92.0,"The people at Hidalgo in Sanlúcar have taken dry Manzanilla and have let it age until it has turned golden and mature. The bouquet is full of exotic oils, nuts and some horsehide. In the mouth, it's a touch salty and astringent, but there are buttery, sweet undertones and great focus. And on the back end the pure flavor of mushroom and almonds is uncanny. Sleek, acidic and likely perfect with lobster or shrimp bisque."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Gibbs,18.0,92.0,"Balanced and food-friendly, this white is stainless-steel fermented and likably crisp. Medium bodied and textured, it shines in a lively bouquet of apple, peach, apricot and Key lime, finishing in a flurry of nutmeg and lemongrass."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Norton,18.0,92.0,"Opaque purple and thick in the glass, this wine has inky, supercharged aromas of ripe blackberry and spice. It feels amped up but balanced, with more intensity and clarity than what most other $18 reds offer. The flavors of wild berry, mild herb and chocolate finish in a rich, toasty wrapping."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Couhins,18.0,92.0,"Firm while also juicy, this is a bright and fruity wine. It has plenty of acidity as well as a lively texture that will allow this attractive wine to age well over the medium term. Drink from 2024."
Alsace white blend,France,Alsace,Clément Klur,18.0,92.0,Peach and rose-focused potpourri scent the nose. The palate has great direction and freshness and a rich textured core that almost comes across as oily. The result is a perfect contrast between tangy freshness and rich fruit. Bursting fruit and perfume are countered by zesty citrus. The flavors last and last and the finish is dry.
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine Cauhapé,18.0,92.0,"A blend of 70% Gros Manseng and 30% Petit Manseng, this is a serious, full-bodied wine that's rich and concentrated. It has weight, ripe quince and green plum flavors, and strong herb and honey elements. It is ready to drink, although it should last up to a year."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Alvear,18.0,92.0,"Molasses, spice, chocolate and pure raisins define this as classic P.X. It's syrupy but not too much so, with maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors. For a sweet and candied dessert wine, it has excellent balance and persistence. A star among many in this category; these wines are hard not to like."
Chardonnay,US,California,Taken Wine Co.,18.0,92.0,"Pretty aromas of fresh white flowers and apple blossom open this mouthfilling, satisfying wine. Complex and interesting on the palate, it's layered with tension and acidity. It has a lean, clean finish that's dialed-in for the table."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Hendry,18.0,92.0,"A balanced and lilting 100% varietal white that touched no oak, it's sublime in white peach and garden herb notes, with memorable minerality on the finish. Crisp and refreshing, it's ideal for picnics, beach outings and pairing with light fare."
Mourvèdre-Syrah,Australia,South Australia,Cascabel,18.0,92.0,"This McLaren Vale winery specializes in blends of Mediterranean varieties, and this is a fine example. It's 70% Mourvèdre and 30% Syrah, featuring plum, berry and cedary vanilla notes, plus a bit of meatiness on the nose. Richly textured on the palate, it finishes long."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,18.0,92.0,"The aromatic tang of ripe lemon peel plays on the nose. The palate is pervaded by the same refreshing zestiness, shimmering with cheerful citrus brightness amidst riper notions of pear and peach. This is mouth-watering stuff, almost addictive with its dry zesty finish."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Provam,18.0,92.0,"This is a rich impressively structured wine. It showcases the Alvarinho and brings out its fruit and flavors. The subtle wood aging has just enhanced the fruit. The wine is delicious and is now just ready to drink, although it will be better from early 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,18.0,92.0,"While the nose gives little away apart from a yeasty roundness, the palate shines with crisp, pure Conference pear fruit and a herbal tinge of watercress and arugula with the merest notes of salty soy. Slender, poised and very enjoyable."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,18.0,92.0,"Production has zoomed to almost 11,000 cases, but the quality remains. Deep, delicious flavors of melon, grapefruit and kiwi anchor the wine. The sensation of wet rocks and bracing minerality runs alongside the lip-smacking fruit. Perfectly ripe, dense and wonderfully sappy, this is a real gem."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Upland Estates,18.0,92.0,"Thoroughly delicious. This captures a distinctive side of the grape that blends a sweet grassy herbaceousness with a lively mix of apple, lemongrass, citrus and orange peel, finished with the slightest suggestion of honey."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,18.0,92.0,"Continuing the succession of fine wines from Aveleda's Quinta da Agueira in Bairrada, this is a powerful, firmly tannic but ultimately smooth wine. It has big ripe swathes of dark plums, figs and refreshing sweet acidity."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château Jolys,18.0,92.0,"Great spice, honey and tropical fruits are subtly combined in this delicious, elegant sweet wine. With acidity to add its fresher character, it is balanced, full in the mouth and already a very fine wine. It is better to age it, though, so drink after 2017."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Panther Creek,18.0,92.0,"Lush and creamy, this is loaded with seductive flavors of ripe pear, melon and sweet apple. There's a hint of whipped cream and a dash of vanilla, but not overbearing or in any way artificial. It's simply delicious."
Teroldego,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,92.0,"A remarkable full-bodied wine, this has great concentration and depth of flavor, with a dense but fine-grained texture to go along with it. The color is virtually black, with a dark red rim, and the flavors are deep and delicious, like dark chocolate and blackberry jam. This is fascinating to taste now, but will be best to drink after 2018."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,18.0,92.0,"A delicious wine whose richness is matched by great texture and big, juicy fruits. It has plenty of tannins, but they meld easily into the rich ripe fruits, leaving a wine with a structure that offers considerable potential."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Kevin White,18.0,92.0,"A blend of 44% Syrah, 31% Grenache and 25 Mourvèdre, this wine is aromatically very pure, with plenty of red and blue fruit, speckled with bay leaf, herb and black-pepper accents. It possesses a thrilling plush mouthfeel, with olive and black-fruit flavors, showing a fine sense of purity."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,18.0,92.0,"There's an exotic edge to the nose of this wine, suggesting juicy, ripe mango and passion fruit. The palate is zesty and fresh and still rings with yeasty savor. It's slender yet concentrated and has a lasting flavor that encompasses yeasty richness and citrus tones. Lip-smackingly refreshing."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,18.0,92.0,"A powerful wine, very concentrated, the tannins a part of the richer fruit and dark brooding character of the wine. There is good juiciness as well, black fruits and acidity cutting through the dominant young tannins."
Syrah,US,California,Charles B. Mitchell,18.0,92.0,"This wine brings out the variety's richness and depth of fruit flavors, while keeping the texture smooth and pleasing. It's very firm with tannins and acidity, yet not overly full-bodied. The ripe blackberry and cassis flavors have the intensity to match the structure and make for great balance overall."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,18.0,92.0,"This intense and rich wine has also managed to keep a great sense of balance. The black fruits emerge from the firm tannins, bringing with them juicy acidity and a dusty texture. The wine is still young, but it's developing well to emerge ripe and delicious by 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,18.0,92.0,"Here is another outstanding Sauvignon Blanc from Novelty Hill—ripe and juicy, showing citrus, mango and pear, laced with cinnamon highlights. Winemaker Mike Januik manages to get the most from these young vines, crafting white wines that are both rich and elegant, retain varietal character, and seduce you with hedonistic detail."
Gewürztraminer,Canada,British Columbia,Township 7,18.0,92.0,"Here is a splendid example of this variety, intensely spicy, with the characteristic scents and flavors of rose petals, lychee fruit and baby powder. It shows tremendous depth and precision, and could be cellared through 2020, but why wait?"
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine Maby,18.0,92.0,"This complex rosé effortlessly combines hints of flowers, dried spices, garrigue and red berries. It's full-bodied yet paradoxically weightless, buoyed by a long finish of crushed stone and fresh lime juice. Drink it over the next few years."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Marangona,18.0,92.0,"Aromas of white spring flower, mature orchard fruit and a whiff of graphite float out of the glass. The fresh, concentrated palate doles out ripe white peach, mature Granny Smith and Bosc pear while mineral and almond notes back up the finish."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Michael David,18.0,92.0,"This wine is not at all petite, with its richly layered and concentrated palate. It has an abundance of fine-grained tannins to support its opulent flavors of dark fruits and oaky spices. Full bodied but plush and soothing in texture, it blends in 15% Petit Verdot. Drink through 2022."
Pinot Gris,US,Washington,Tranche,18.0,92.0,"Tranche does an excellent job with this grape; here the palate-filling flavors are round and fleshy, with peach and pear fruit. Short-term neutral-barrel aging has further smoothed out the mouthfeel, and it finishes delightfully with just a hint of butter."
Gewürztraminer,Canada,British Columbia,Quails' Gate,18.0,92.0,"Many Okanagan wineries turn out respectable Gewürz, but this one has more precision, focus and complexity than the rest, with a detailed mix of citrus and apple fruits, immaculately set against bracing acids. There is some sweetness, which serves to pump up the midpalate, but the acids rule."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Iris Vineyards,18.0,92.0,"This variety is a standout at this estate, and the latest vintage is the best yet. Classic pear-fruit flavors carry interesting notes of mint, cinnamon and even a touch of honey. It's rich and incredibly long through the finish."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Michael David,18.0,92.0,"The blend of sweet-seeming oak and bold, ripe fruit flavors is irresistible in this big and satisfying wine. The aromas are like vanilla, chocolate and black pepper, while flavors bring on blackberry jam, espresso and dark chocolate for volume and complexity on the palate."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Marisco Vineyards,18.0,92.0,"A strong effort, this medium-bodied wine combines hints of nettle leaf with bold fruit flavors of nectarine, pineapple and grapefruit. There's creamy texture and ample concentration on the midpalate, followed by a long, silky finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Markus Molitor,18.0,92.0,"Whiffs of saffron and honey lend a sweet, spicy tone to this off-dry Riesling. It's lusciously ripe on the palate, with juicy white peach and honeydew flavors accented by layers of candle wax and crushed slate. Brisk and bright with acidity, it's effortlessly quaffable, but with refinement and depth."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Tenuta Roveglia,18.0,92.0,"Delicately scented, this opens with aromas of white spring flower, orchard fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean herb. On the creamy palate, an energizing mineral vein underscores golden apple, juicy white and peach and nectarine."
Riesling,US,Washington,Nefarious,18.0,92.0,"This is estate grown, from a Lake Chelan winery in an emerging region. Riesling is clearly a strength, as this has a delicate elegance often missing from the fruit bombs that can be grown in warmer sites. Bone dry, dusty and lightly floral in the nose. The balance of blossom, yellow fruits, juicy acidity and wet rock is impeccable; the wine extends itself gracefully into a lingering finish."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Wittmann,18.0,92.0,"The 100 Hills is Wittmann's entry-level bottling, but it offers a deeply layered minerality, pristine citrus flavors and richness of texture often lacking in far more expensive wines. Its opulent, slightly slick mouthfeel is intensely satisfying, yet cut by a spray of zesty acidity that lifts and lengthens the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Monte da Ravasqueira,18.0,92.0,"If you haven't tried Portuguese wines before, this impressively rich wine is a good place to start. Aging for three years, with 12 months in wood, gives it a smooth, ripe black-fruit character. The acidity and the fruit are a seamless part of the texture of the tannins. The wine is ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Esk Valley,18.0,92.0,"This shows just how good Gimblett Gravels reds can be even at such a fair price point. Senior Winemaker Gordon Russell has fashioned a full-bodied, dark and dense wine that shows hints of vanilla and cedar which frame dark plum and cassis fruit, then slowly fade into a long, velvety finish. Drink 2020–2030."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Monteraponi,18.0,92.0,"Here's a classically crafted Chianti Classico that offers a multifaceted boiuquet of wild cherry, spice and leather, with a hint of meat juices and herbs. The palate shows a core of black-cherry layered with white pepper and rosemary. It's still young, briskly tannic and nervous so give this time to fully develop. Drink 2016–2025."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Territorial,18.0,92.0,"Here's another exceptional Oregon Riesling to add to the growing ranks of top producers. Lemon-drop fruit meets peaches and cream in the mouth, as this off-dry (20g/L) wine displays a spot-on balance between acid, sugar, fruit and honey. This is delicious already, and built to age nicely over a decade or longer."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Arbor Brook,18.0,92.0,"Bright and spicy, this is Pinot Gris with a bit of the grassy bite of a Loire Valley Sauvignon Blanc. Racy and loaded with grapefruit and pineapple flavors, this lingers lazily through a refreshing, acid-driven finish that invites further sipping."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Vincens,18.0,92.0,"This is a ripe and opulent wine. It has rich tannins and generous black fruits but it still offers a spicy wood-aging flavor. As it develops, the intense fruits and smoky flavors will come to dominate, while always preserving the structure of the wine. It is a wine to age a bit, so drink from 2017."
Riesling,US,Washington,Convergence Zone,17.0,92.0,"By far the best Dewpoint to date, this tastes bone dry, yet it's succulent, concentrated, and lightly honeyed. The deep flavors of ripe Meyer lemon and citrus just keep on going and going."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Ponzi,17.0,92.0,"Fragrant with floral notes, lemony fruit and hints of apricot, this is a tangy, textural take on Pinot Gris. Fermented in stainless steel and released young, it retains a bright and stylish profile right through a lingering finish, with a touch of sweetness."
Riesling,US,Washington,Elevation Cellars,17.0,92.0,"Big for a Riesling, this has concentrated, sappy, rich tropical-fruit flavors. The grapes used were sourced from the Lawrence Vineyard on the Royal Slope. It has a fair amount of residual sugar, adding extra richness. Succulent peach, apricot and papaya notes sends lip-licking flavors deep into the finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Claude Branger,17.0,92.0,"Les Gras Moutons is regarded as one of the top vineyards of Sèvre et Maine. Here it has produced a richly fragrant, aromatic wine that is structured and tightly textured. It's full of acidity, freshly squeezed lemon and some minerality. Drink from 2016."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,17.0,92.0,"Neither McLaren Vale nor Adelaide Hills are particularly known for their Rieslings, but this is a fine example. Scents of wet stone and flower-shop greens lead into off-dry flavors of lemon zest and green apples. The balance between sugar and acids, lithe body and long finish is finely judged. Drink now–2025."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Belle-Vue,17.0,92.0,"Situated in the southern Médoc village of Macau, on the edge of the deep Margaux gravels, this estate has produced an impressive and structured wine. It is concentrated with its black currants and dark tannins. It is likely to develop slowly over several years. Drink from 2021."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Ponzi,17.0,92.0,"This estate-grown, single-vineyard Pinot Blanc is succulent, tart and tangy, with lightly spicy citrus, kiwi and starfruit flavors. The lingering finish, lightly flecked with dried herbs, shows amazing grip and texture, with a mineral ridge across the mid palate. Great elegance and length."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,17.0,92.0,"Lifted, pear-scented freshness dominates the nose while the palate is soft but has a pleasing and linear citrus focus. This is poised and offers sophisticated refreshment."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,17.0,92.0,"Along with a gorgeous blend of ripe fruits—apple, pear, and a bit of tangy pineapple—this wine carries a streak of wet stone into a full-bodied, lingering finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château la Vivonne,17.0,92.0,"Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness. There is also a more serious mineral texture that comes with tangy acidity. Age this wine for a few more months and drink from the end of 2017."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,17.0,92.0,"Fragrant hints of bergamot and Seville orange play enticingly on the nose of this beguiling wine. The palate amplifies those juicy, tart and lively flavors, sending them dancing into the finish. It's fresh, fruit-driven, dry and utterly moreish."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Les Vignobles Gueissard,17.0,92.0,"This is a superbly rich wine that is packed with generous black fruits and balanced acidity. It has structure and concentrated plum and damson fruits. The wood aging still shows in what is young wine, although this will go. Drink this impressive wine from 2019."
Castelão,Portugal,Palmela,Wines & Winemakers,17.0,92.0,"This is a finely perfumed wine, full of ripe Castelão grapes. It has a smooth, polished feeling from the wood aging, yet still allows plenty of room for a dense black-fruit character. It will need to age and will be best after 2016."
Vermentino,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Vigne Surrau,17.0,92.0,"Aromas of apple, exotic fruit and Mediterranean scrub lead the nose while the fresh, savory palate shows juicy white peach, mint and citrus zest. It has lovely balance, structure and finesse."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Gruber Röschitz,17.0,92.0,"Fresh pear peel, ripe pear fruit and a touch of citrus make for an inviting, appetizing nose. The palate takes all this fruit as a backdrop on which to display both herb and spice: white pepper, chervil, miso and salt. This interplay of spice and fruit is savory, slender and vivid, giving a moreish, totally balanced wine."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Michel Gassier,17.0,92.0,"A super bargain, this is a concentrated, structured glass of gamy Syrah. Black cherry liqueur, black olives, espresso and meaty flavors combine on the full-bodied palate, finishing with a hefty dose of smoky goodness. Drink now–2025."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,17.0,92.0,"Ripe, juicy notes of yellow pear on the nose are shot through with lively, zesty lemon freshness. Smatterings of white pepper play around the sleek edges of this slender but super-juicy wine. This is totally enlivening and sings with fruit and freshness—with all the verve of its vintage."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de Rhodes,17.0,92.0,"Made from organic grapes, this wine blends every variety grown in Gaillac. Everything gels together to give a concentrated wine that is both solid and powerful with a dry core. Rich berry fruits are complemented by a stream of acidity. It's a wine to age; drink from 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Josef Bauer,17.0,92.0,"Ivy leaf and ripe, green pear notes make up this wine's enticing nose. The palate brims with juicy pear and citrus, feeling concentrated, lively and moreish. Dry and streamlined with citrus, it also layers pear and peach fruit before finishing with lip-smacking citrus zest."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Ribatejo,Caves Velhas,17.0,92.0,"Impressive, ripe wine, the acidity and black fruits meld together in a harmonious whole. It has fresh fruit as well as dark tannins, wood aging giving a rounded feel to the texture. Age for two years."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine des Carteresses,17.0,92.0,"This is ripe, round and lush. Cherry-scented goodness leads the way, accented by hints of cracked pepper, cinnamon and allspice that linger elegantly on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,17.0,92.0,"Lots of funky yeast still hovers above the wine, underneath there is grassy, savory freshness, reminiscent of salty soy. Lime zestiness is edged with peppery verve. This is a layered superspicy Grüner that deserves your full attention. The textured palate makes it easy to linger and savor."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Breuil,17.0,92.0,This wine comes from an estate surrounding an impressive castle. The estate itself was created in the 6th century and is under the same ownership as neighboring Château Cissac. The wine is dark colored with intense flavor. It's sourced from old vines and carries Petit Verdot in the blend. It has the weight and the richness to age well. Drink from 2022.
Moscato,Italy,Piedmont,G D Vajra,17.0,92.0,"Fresh and fragrant, this foaming dessert wine opens with aromas of orange blossom, chopped herb and ripe orchard fruit. The bright, generous palate doles out juicy yellow peach, apricot, Bartlett pear and lemon drop alongside fresh acidity and a hint of mineral. A sage note closes the finish."
Weissburgunder,Austria,Wagram,Ecker,17.0,92.0,Rich golden and red apple notes play on the nose of this appetizing wine. The palate echos the aroma with both ripe generosity and crisp freshness.

Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Judean Hills,Jerusalem Wineries,17.0,92.0,"Deep ruby in color, this wine has a nose of black cherry and green bell pepper. The well-balanced flavor profile features notes of cherry, strawberry, smoked meat, Mediterranean herbs and eucalyptus. A network of generous tannins supports a persistent sensation of brightness on the side palate and smoky notes across the center of the tongue."
Pinot Noir,US,California,J. Lohr,17.0,92.0,"Deep, inviting aromas of cherry, strawberry and cranberry mesh with red licorice, violet and nutmeg on this superbly priced wine. It's a fleshy Pinot, named after a falcon that perches in the vineyard's lone pine tree, with pretty, punch-like flavors of violet, rose and more red fruit."
Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Pierre Henri Morel,17.0,92.0,"Full bodied and opulent, yet remarkably refreshing at the same time, wines like this are why the commune of Laudun is so highly regarded as a white-wine terroir within the warm Southern Rhône. Honey, pineapple and stone fruit notes linger through the finish, balanced by hints of crushed stone and citrus. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Upper Galilee,Recanati,17.0,92.0,"Red-violet in the glass, this wine has a nose of black cherry, cocoa and freshly ground coffee. It is soft on entry, but velvety tannins and flavors of blackberry, vanilla, espresso bean and a soft hint of cocoa powder render it a more sophisticated quaff than first sip would suggest."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weixelbaum,17.0,92.0,"Concentrated grapefruit zest and lemon peel with undertones of peppery herbs on a very concentrated, sleek palate. The pepperiness and zest reverberates for an immensely refreshing quaff. There is poise, concentration and a long, clean finish."
Merlot,Israel,Galilee,Recanati,17.0,92.0,"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine offers rich aromas of cherry, black licorice and orange rind and flavors of blackberry, black cherry, cassis, anisette and eucalyptus. Long-lasting tannins coat the mouth but there is always a sense of fresh fruit on the palate and a brightness that lingers right into the satisfying finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,17.0,92.0,"A floral freshness hovers above the lemony notes on the nose. It is those concentrated, clean but ripe and pure lemon notes that totally inform the slender and dry palate. This is light but has real impact. Its fruity core reveals some fresh apple notes on the long, clean and refreshing finish. Drink now through 2025 at least."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio de Tares,17.0,92.0,"Dark, ripe aromas of blackberry and cassis are accented by tree bark, baking spice and licorice notes. This feels ripe, loamy and borderline jammy. Flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, cocoa and loamy earth finish toasty and weighty. Drink through 2017."
Shiraz,Israel,Upper Galilee,Recanati,17.0,92.0,"Aromas of blackberry, aniseed and nutmeg make way for flavors of black cherry, pomegranate, espresso and cocoa powder with a touch of green bell pepper. It is bright and fruity on entry, with tannins that sneak up and then linger into the bright pomegranate-laced finish."
Riesling,US,Washington,Tapteil Vineyard,17.0,92.0,"This bone-dry-tasting wine is made from grapes that were sourced from the Alayt Vineyard. It marries light hints of flowers to notes of citrus, apples and pears, which taste more like the fruits' textural skin than its sweet flesh. The impressive minerality, depth and length elevate this bottling to the A-list of Washington Rieslings."
Moschofilero,Greece,Mantinia,Boutari,17.0,92.0,"Lemon, orange blossom and rose aromas start this exotic and refreshing wine. On the palate, bright flavors of citrus mingle with melon and pepper. Easygoing but distinctive."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Jules Taylor,17.0,92.0,"A ripe, lush style of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, this features ample nectarine and cassis fruit, tinged with just a bit of green leafiness. Ample weight on the mouth gives way to a long, mouthwatering finish. Winemaker Jules Taylor is on a roll."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Blaignan,16.0,92.0,"Aromatic hints of new wood translate onto the smooth palate. It has smoke and black currant flavors, with tannins that are already well integrated. Attractive acidity gives this a final lift. Keep it for 5–6 years."
Moscato,US,California,Uvaggio,16.0,92.0,"This bone-dry and floral wine will taste great with simple appetizers like toasted nuts or fresh cheeses. It is very well concentrated and has medium to full body. An opulent texture helps carry the floral, appley, grapefruity flavors into the finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Les Frères Couillaud,16.0,92.0,"Old vines, up to 60 years old, are the basis of this concentrated, ripe and intense wine. It is impressive and tightly wound, with layers of rich citrus fruit and a chalky texture. This is still a little young, so drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Unger,16.0,92.0,"Soft, delicate pear and gentle citrus coalesce into a more citrus-focused, super-fresh palate with verve and elegance. Light-footed but concentrated, this is graceful, with wonderful minerality."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Provam,16.0,92.0,"The producer is based in the Monção and Melgaço region of northern Vinho Verde. It is crisp—so fresh and cut with apple and citrus acidity. Light and poised, it has just the lightest touch of wood from the short oak aging. Drink now."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,16.0,92.0,"While this needs a little air, the nose is spicy, full of that Zweigelt pepper, with subtle but gorgeously aromatic notes of violets and black cherries. This is understated and seductive. The floral, spiced fruit continues throughout the slender but concentrated palate and makes for a lovely, clean, evocative and lasting finish. It's elegance rather than power that convinces here. Hurray to that."
Touriga Nacional,US,Washington,Thurston Wolfe,16.0,92.0,"Every bit as good as the dazzling 2009, this is 100% Touriga Nacional grapes. Sappy and acidic, it has extraordinarily deep and succulent flavors of raspberries, along with lush, chocolatey tannins. It's startlingly good, and though entirely ageworthy, almost impossible to ignore at the moment."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio de Tares,16.0,92.0,"The 2015 harvest produced a bumper crop of excellent Bierzo wines, Baltos included. Aromas of black fruits and violets are full and floral, with a hint of nicely scented candle. There's balance to the palate along with toasty, blackened flavors of blackberry and spice. Toasty notes persist on a well-balanced finish. Drink this fairly dense and wholly delicious Mencía trough 2020."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Brandborg,16.0,92.0,"Brandborg really knocks it out of the park with this Gewürztraminer, the strongest in a very solid lineup of white wines. It perfectly captures the oily, floral essence of the grape, in a dense, focused wine loaded with citrus oil, Key lime, and tropical fruits. Great length and balance, as with all the Brandborg white wines."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Obrigado,16.0,92.0,"A classic Dão blend, which includes Alfrocheiro and Jaen grapes, this is produced by top winemaker Alvaro Castro. A year in oak has given it richness and a smooth, almost velvety character. Underneath this surface, the tannins are all there, balancing the ripe fruit flavors. It will develop well; drink from 2017."
Riesling,US,Washington,Hogue,16.0,92.0,"Irresistible from the get-go, this fragrant wine offers up inviting aromas of citrus, stone and exotic tropical fruits. Flavors of ripe peaches, brightened with vivid acidity, keep it in perfect balance. The 1.4% residual sugar is barely noticeable; the finish lingers gracefully and refreshes the palate, inviting the next sip."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Bonterra,16.0,92.0,"Beautifully integrated oak and a firm structure combine in this rather tight but superbly balanced wine. It smells like black cherries and tastes like raspberries and blueberries, accented by toasted baguette, cinnamon and fresh cedar notes. The finish is long and lightly spicy. Best after 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta das Marias,16.0,92.0,"Aged for a year in oak, this rich wine is a blend that includes Touriga Nacional and Alfrocheiro. It has a fine structure that brings in dense tannins as well as a darker, firmer character that will allow it to age further. Drink from 2018."
Moscato,US,California,Uvaggio,16.0,92.0,"A stunning and unusual white wine out of Lodi made by Jim Moore, with tremendous aromatics of honeysuckle and melon and a genius balancing between sweetness and acidity. Grapes—technically Moscato Giallo—were harvested from the Bella Vigna Vineyard fully ripe but at low brix, allowing this bottling to maintain a very low 12% alcohol level. An amazing deal for a wine that jumps out of the glass, all bright and starry eyed."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Gruber Röschitz,16.0,92.0,"Yellow grapefruit peel, crushed white peppercorns and fresh chervil paint a picture of a quintessential Grüner here: flavorsome but not heavy, concentrated but slender, easy to enjoy but never facile. More ripe pear fruit lurks temptingly at the core while that grapefruit theme is utterly convincing and captivating."
Port,US,Washington,Thurston Wolfe,16.0,92.0,"Gorgeous and authentic, this full-flavored, Port-style wine renders deep, flavors of black cherry and cassis liqueur. Dark veins of chocolate syrup and coffee liqueur pump through the mix, making it smooth as butter. It's a wine that could age—but why wait?"
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaines Landron,16.0,92.0,"Landron's complex wine comes from organic grapes that add a line of purity to the bright white and citrus fruits. A textured wine, this needs to age for a few months to round out the fragrant fruitiness and open up the structure. Drink from 2016."
Primitivo,US,California,Boeger,16.0,92.0,"This full-bodied but stealthy and deep wine looks very dark in color. It has moderate ripe fruit and spice aromas, but doesn't really show its cards until the flavors almost explode with boysenberry and blackberry jam, and nuances of wood smoke and dark chocolate hit the palate. It has great intensity, layers of flavor and a nice, lingering finish."
Riesling,Canada,Ontario,Cave Spring,16.0,92.0,"Cave Spring rocks Riesling, and this off-dry (16g/L) version is sexy and mineral-drenched. It's a perfect mix of sweet and tangy, the citrus and tree fruits dense with complex phenolic highlights that add to a wine that's textural, full bodied and long."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaji,Royal Tokaji,16.0,92.0,"This wine is straw in color, with delightful notes of lemon curds and apricot blossoms. On the palate, freshly picked apricot and Anjou pear provide the core to a slightly spiced backdrop, finishing crisp and clean. Pair this wine with your favorite spicy Asian dish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Beira Atlantico,Luis Pato,16.0,92.0,"Pato's pair of old vine wines, a red and this white, are beautifully complex. With its rich melon, tropical fruits, spice and light toastiness, this wine is concentrated with still-young acidity and currant fruit flavors. It's a great wine that needs to develop before drinking. Wait until 2016."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Vincens,16.0,92.0,"The blend of Malbec and Merlot allows the wine to develop relatively quickly, broadening out the tannins of the Malbec. This wine is ripe with black and red berry fruits, packed with both acidity and dry tannins. It is developing into a generous and full-bodied wine. Drink from 2017."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château Jolys,16.0,92.0,"Like all Jurançon, this wine brings together great richness and great freshness. The honey and peach fruits are laced with acidity to give the wine poise, while hints of dry botrytis promise aging. This is a ripe, full wine that should be drunk from 2017."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Provam,16.0,92.0,"A selection of the best parcels of Alvarinho, this is a wood fermented wine. It is round and soft with as much spice as fruit. The texture is full, lightly tangy as well as hinting at minerality. The aftertaste, with its rich toast, is generous and suggests the wine is ready to drink."
Moscato,Italy,Piedmont,Saracco,16.0,92.0,"Intensely aromatic, this opens with tantalizing scents of citrus blossom, yellow peach and aromatic herb. The creamy, foaming palate offers apricot, candied tangerine zest, lemon drop and a note of crystallized ginger. Bright acidity and a hint of thyme lift the rich flavors."
Viognier,US,Washington,Watermill,16.0,92.0,"From the beguiling aromatics to the thrilling palate that's saturated with flavors of citrus flesh and rind, tangerine and green apple, this Viognier offers superb focus. The length and detail are noteworthy, but the taste is simply delicious."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Companhia das Quintas,16.0,92.0,"Powerful and complex, this is solid and impressive, made from a selection of wines. It is dark, dense, full of blackberry fruit and dry tannins. The wood aging still shows in the spiciness, while the tight fruit flavors bring out the acidity. Drink this wine from 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Vicente Faria Vinhos,16.0,92.0,"This balanced, rich wine is produced by a family company dating to the 19th century. It has tannins, signs of wood aging and layers of black fruits. Still young, it will develop well into a solid, concentrated wine. Drink from 2020."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine Corne-Loup,16.0,92.0,"Round and harmonious on the palate, this wine is a terrific value. Floral notes mark the nose, backed up by raspberry and strawberry fruit, while an undercurrent of crushed stone provides depth and backbone. The finish is berry-filled, but balanced and savory."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,16.0,92.0,"This is just about perfect Sémillon— the gorgeous fruit has more flesh and breadth with flavors suggesting ripe fig, melon and citrus. The use of oak is judicious and thoughtful; it adds grace notes without dominating. You can't help but wonder why this grape remains such a novelty (except, ironically, at Novelty Hill!). It's seductive, delicious and unique."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Brander,16.0,92.0,"Fred Brander and winemaker Fabian Bravo study Sauvignon Blanc through several bottlings each year, but this Santa Ynez Valley appellation cuvee is an early favorite for 2013. Delicate flinty notes on the nose are bolstered with honey dew and apple. The palate leads with a lot of zing that evolves into flavors of kiwi and pear, with a slightly buttery, almost vanilla finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Türk,16.0,92.0,"The nose is still unwilling to yield much. This is tightly closed, but the palate shows what lies in store: wonderful grapefruit peel and enticing, herbal pepperiness. This is very sleek and zesty, concentrated and utterly refreshing with a delicious lick of lemon on the finish."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Centovigne,16.0,92.0,"A fragrant blend of 80% Nebbiolo and 20% Vespolina and Croatina, this stunning red offers enticing scents of dark-skinned berry, tilled soil, new leather, dark spice and a balsamic note. Elegant, structured and savory, it boasts juicy black-cherry, raspberry, white-pepper, cinnamon and tobacco flavors set against a backbone of firm, refined tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2019–2030."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Château d'Aqueria,16.0,92.0,"Favorable exchange rates have lowered the price of this gem to nearly everyday status, making it a terrific value. Ripe melon and red berry flavors are supported by a firm bed of crushed stone, then garnished by subtle spice notes. Typical of Tavel, it's on the full-bodied side for a rosé, but doesn't seem heavy at all. Drink now–2018."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Deer Creek,16.0,92.0,"Deer Creek is on a roll with their Pinot Gris, and winemaker Herb Quady may have a lot to do with it. This aromatic, distinctive and flat-out delicious bottle is a real treasure. Great mouthfeel comes with a touch of mint, set against notes of cinnamon and brown sugar. It's ripe, rich and loaded with fruit flavors of juicy fruit gum and pears."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,15.0,92.0,"A rich, full-bodied wine from one of the masters of Tannat, Pierre Laplace, this has ripe tannins and layers of toast, black plum and berry, with intense acidity on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Buchegger,15.0,92.0,"Pure notes of ripe but crisp pear on the nose turn into concentrated, herb-spiced pear and citrus notes on the palate: the ripeness of the pear vies with the zesty freshness and makes of a lively, vivid and most enjoyable and refreshing wine. This is crisp, light bodied but balanced and puts a little Austrian spring in your step."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Tilleuls,15.0,92.0,"Because it is crafted from old vines from a single parcel, this wine has been released a year later than usual for Muscadet. The result is a wine that has lost its puppy acidity while gaining ripe fruit and a soft texture. The wine was aged for 18 months on lees, which also contributed to its richness. Drink this delicious wine now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tour Grand Mayne,15.0,92.0,"Richly structured, this wine is dense and solid. It has swathes of ripe fruit, bold tannins and an impressive firm character. Its future is assured with its dense texture, black fruit and acidity all coming into place. Drink from 2021."
Red Blend,Italy,Veneto,Monte del Frà,15.0,92.0,"Aromas of ground black pepper and wild berry lead the way. The juicy delicious palate mirrors the nose, doling out succulent Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry and cinnamon. Easygoing and balanced, it boasts supple tannins and fresh acidity. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de Porrais,15.0,92.0,"The wine has power, structure and density. Hard initial tannins show that it needs to age, but the black fruits come through richly as it opens up. The strong mineral character gives a firm texture to the wine. Drink from 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Ecker,15.0,92.0,"A warm but fresh green and yellow pear peel scent on the nose gains even more currency on the palate of this wine. The midpalate exudes a savory, yeasty, textural element that provides structure and interest, yet the finish is very fresh."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Felten Cellars,15.0,92.0,"Extremely light in color, this dry wine has aromas that show Key lime pie, apple blossom and white rocks. It's tight and interesting on the bone-dry palate, with chipped chalk followed by apple tart, Bosc and Asian pear, lime juice and pith, and a dainty touch of honey on the finish. It's held together by strong but not bracing acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,15.0,92.0,"A powerful and concentrated wine, this shows the region's dark and tannic side. The black plum and juicy black-currant flavors shine, and wood aging has smoothed the palate, which makes it feel dense and fully mature."
Syrah-Grenache,France,Rhône Valley,Mas des Bressades,15.0,92.0,"A terrific value, the 2013 Cuvée Tradition shows the sort of concentration and ripeness you'd only expect to find in much pricier bottlings. Black olive, cassis and cured meat notes deliver ample complexity, and the wine finishes long, with supple tannins."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,15.0,92.0,"The 2009 vintage of this wine was one of the stars from Georges Duboeuf, and this 2010 fits the same pattern. It has great richness, spice, black cherry fruits, the acidity offering the fruity side of the wine. Ready for aging two years."
Riesling,US,Washington,Kiona,15.0,92.0,"As with Kiona's off-dry Washington Riesling, this includes a bit of Gewürztraminer, a clever addition that brings some spiciness into play. Intensely aromatic, the wine is almost Muscat-like, with dense orange peel flavors, along with citrus, tea and madeleine cookie. This is a sensational value from a leading Riesling producer."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Global Wines,15.0,92.0,"A bold wine, this is full of ripe tannins and black-plum fruits. The local Baga grape dominates the blend, giving its special style of firm tannins that are integrated into the rich fruits. The wine will be best from 2018."
Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,France,Loire Valley,Bouvet-Ladubay,15.0,92.0,"This attractive young, fruity wine is crisp, tangy and with delicious freshness. Its floral aroma and ripe pear and melon fruitiness give it a fine rich balance. With a delicious bright aftertaste the wine is ready to drink."
Carignano,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Sella & Mosca,15.0,92.0,"This elegantly structured wine opens with aromas of black plum, mocha, Mediterranean herbs and a hint of scorched earth. The round, enveloping palate doles out ripe black cherry, blackberry, cinnamon and white pepper, while firm, silky tannins provide the framework. A fantastic wine, it's already enjoyable and will offer fine drinking over the next few years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château le Peyrat,15.0,92.0,"This wine is finely balanced—an impressive mix of ripe fruit and rich tannins. A smoky character envelops its rich blackberry and plum flavors, all underlined with tannins. It needs to age and will be best from 2020."
Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Portugal,Tejo,Fiuza,15.0,92.0,"This dry, spicy, solidly tannic wine is still young. Its fruit, still hidden behind the structure, promises ripe plums and berries. For now, it's impressively powerful, with layer upon layer of chocolate and coffee marked with bright acidity on the finish. Drink from 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Branco,15.0,92.0,"The vines of Casal Branco are planted in what was once the falcon hunting grounds of the Portuguese kings—hence the name of this wine. It's a big, bold wine with flavors of mint and black fruit. It shows its wood aging in the smooth texture and touch of spice that give it a harmonious, rich aftertaste."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Ruhlmann,15.0,92.0,"Tangerine and mirabelle plum aromas combine on a very inviting nose. The palate is slender and fresh, framing the ripe mirabelle fruit in zesty refreshing brightness. This is dry and lemony, ripe and whistle clean. The tangy lemon flavors create a long and bracingly clean, utterly refreshing finish."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Markus Altenburger,15.0,92.0,"Lovely cinnamon-tinged blueberry and plum notes rise enticingly from the glass. The palate is firm and fresh, cracking with taut, ripe plum and cherry fruit. This is fresh-faced and honest red with just the right amount of grip and structure. The finish is beautifully clean."
Zinfandel,US,California,Za Zin,15.0,92.0,"One of the “12 Zins of Lodi 2014,” it was chosen in a judging by the Lodi Winegrape Commission to represent the region's finest. The deep red-black color is saturated to the rim. Deep, evocative aromas lead to ripe cherry, boysenberry, chocolate and nutmeg flavors that echo on the finish. The texture is full and smooth."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,15.0,92.0,"An impressive and elegant wine. It has a delicious line of juicy red and black berry fruits, powered with a fine balance of acidity and firm, chunky tannins. With good potential, give the wine 3–4 years."
Riesling,US,Washington,O•S Winery,15.0,92.0,"Consistently one of Washington's most expressive Rieslings, with intensely floral aromatics—notably clover—that is carried into the mouth, along with honey, tea, lime, candied pineapple and cantaloupe. The effect is riveting; the flavors cascade around each other, balancing the 20g/L residual sugar with vivid acidity."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Durigutti,15.0,92.0,"Smoky, inky aromas of ripe black fruits, caramel and pencil eraser set up a creamy, chewy palate with flavors of ripe blackberry, cardamom and toffee. An oaky but smooth finish is elevated and not at all hard or soupy. Everything about this blended red comes across right. Drink through 2017."
Red Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Nastl,15.0,92.0,"Pure and vibrant dark and red cherry notes create an irresistible nose. The palate displays the same, invitingly juicy fruit. This is supple, slender, fresh and plump, with a joyful, balanced ripeness. Its tannins are smooth and ripe, ready to enjoy."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,15.0,92.0,"With the richness of the vintage, the natural tannins of Tannat are tamed by the welter of intense black fruits, sweet berries and Arabica coffee. The structure is exhibited in the dusty tannins under all the fruit."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta Dona Matilde,15.0,92.0,"An old vine field blend from the family-owned estate, this wine is dense with both tannin and ripe black fruit. Plum and blackberry flavors are balanced by acidity and chalky texture. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Garnet,15.0,92.0,"Bacon fat and cream soda meet with a flash of patchouli on the nose of this stunning deal from winemaker/author/blogger Alison Crowe. Cherry cola flavors and luscious red fruits get lifted with smoke and plum-skin bitterness, all set against decent tannins and fresh acidity."
Chardonnay,Austria,Burgenland,Gunter Triebaumer,15.0,92.0,"Stone, earth and pear show on the nose. The palate joins with a bittersweet notion that recalls dried pear skin and dried orange rind. The body remains light, but flavors are anchored deeply and earthily. Made in a very balanced late-harvest style, it has an off-dry finish that will be dreamy with salty cheese."
Riesling,US,Oregon,A to Z,15.0,92.0,"A to Z has almost doubled production of this wine, without a hitch in quality. Floral and citrus components gather strength and roll into ripe tropical flavors: juicy Fruit gum, papaya and melon. It's absolutely yummy and a can't miss value."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Carnuntum,Markowitsch,15.0,92.0,"A touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose. The palate is both firm and fruity. This wine is gorgeously ripe, with aromatic fruit captured at the perfect moment. It has grip and muscle, along with juicy, firm freshness that lets the dark and almost brooding black cherry, blueberry and blackberry fruit speak. On the finish, peppery spice appears amid the berries and bright freshness."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Monteiro,15.0,92.0,"Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon merge seamlessly in this richly structured but fruity wine. It is densely concentrated, with a line of tannins cutting through the blackberry fruit flavors. Firm, textured and likely to age well, this is impressive."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beira Interior,Companhia das Quintas,15.0,92.0,"Cool and tight, this is a firmly tannic wine, showing its mineral, primal rock character. The structure is dry, solid, the fruit a layer of cranberry and black fig among all this firmness. It should age, but is ready now."
Riesling,US,Washington,AntoLin Cellars,14.0,92.0,"This cool-climate Riesling, technically off-dry with 2% residual sugar, has very tart, highly extracted flavors, with flavors including tangy citrus, peach, apricot and papaya. The length, acidity, texture, mouthfeel, depth and surpassing freshness are exceptional."
Syrah,US,Washington,Waterbrook,14.0,92.0,"Blended with 12% Grenache and 8% Roussanne, this direct and appealing wine suggests violets, raspberries and plum, with a vanilla top note (21% new American oak). The coffee and blue fruit flavors are rich and full, with vanilla notes lingering on the finish. It's a complete knockout for this price."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Türk,14.0,92.0,"Everything is still tightly coiled: the intense Conference pear fruit, the zesty lime notes, the deeply herbal savoriness. For now, the refreshing lime peel notes are chief amongst its charms but allow this to relax for just a little and this will be a quintessential summer wine of concentration and utter refreshment."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weixelbaum,14.0,92.0,"Riper aspects of Mirabelle plum join the aromatic spectrum dominated by bracing citrus zest. Grapefruit and lemon echo along the palate and surpass themselves in a tight, bracing and concentrated finish. Slender but ultratoned."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Carnuntum,Markowitsch,14.0,92.0,"Slight pepper spice mingles with subdued, tart berry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate adds supple vanilla and strawberry notes, with fine, smooth tannins and pervasive freshness. For now, the vanilla still dominates, but a little bottle age will help. Drink 2018–2022."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,14.0,92.0,"Dark-hued wine, dominated by acidity as well as firm tannins. It shows solid, chunky structure, ripe fruit and plenty of sweetness. Of course, there is acidity as well, the charm of Gamay coming through in the fresh cherry flavors. Age 2–3 years."
Arinto,Portugal,Bucelas,Companhia das Quintas,14.0,92.0,"Pure Arinto from the Lisbon region, this wood-aged wine is delicious and Chardonnay-like in its richness, with great swathes of apples and cream flavors, layered with toast. This is a great advertisement for a neglected region in Portugal's viticulture."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,14.0,92.0,"From the Quinta da Aguieira, this serious, concentrated wine has the violet perfume typical of Touriga Nacional. It is a rich, dense and tannic wine, full of black fruit, dark chocolate and bright acidity. Drink this wine from late 2018."
Tannat-Cabernet Franc,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,14.0,92.0,"Perfumed wine, from a blend of Tannat and Cabernet Franc. Here is a powerful expression of intense terroir. Very concentrated and dense, with the tannins just beginning to soften, the wine is packed with black ripe fruits, solid and chunky."
Riesling,US,Washington,Whitman Cellars,14.0,92.0,"This is the first Riesling from Whitman, and it's a beauty. Lovely, inviting aromas mix roses and rocks, leading into fresh, layered, complex fruit flavors of pear, apple, white peach and orange. It's got plenty of acid so the residual sugar is almost undetectable, but the alcohol stays at a Germanic 12.5%. This is so good it makes you wish that winemaker Steve Lessard had been doing Riesling all along."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Alente,14.0,92.0,"A beautiful wood-aged wine, its power and concentration feel smooth and stylish, with elegant tannins, and toast and ripe black-currant flavors. It's a wine with the potential to age for 3–4 years."
Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,14.0,92.0,"The partner to Aveleda's pure Touriga Nacional Follies, this is a finer wine, with its complexity of flavors coming from the blend. It has red berry and black plum fruit flavors, sweetened by dried prunes and held together by rich, dry tannins."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Clos LaChance,29.0,91.5,"Blueberry pie, black plum, licorice and a touch of tobacco show on the inviting nose of this solid bottling from the Morgan Hill producer. The palate is very well integrated and delicious, with blackberry jam, vanilla cookies and strong espresso flavors, framed by sticky, prominent tannins. Quite inky in the glass, this bottling shows black currant, black cherry and hearty violets on the nose. The palate is quite dark with a strong core flavor of black coffee, enhanced by loamy soils, crushed lava rocks and a touch of tarragon. A thick palate is sliced by bright acidity."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Roederer Estate,29.0,91.5,"A complex and complete wine with everything in place, this tastes delicious from the first whiff to the lingering finish. It has fresh-baked bread and light peach aromas and white-cherry flavors. Well balanced, it's layered on a subtle level and harmonious. This is a mouthfilling, plush-textured, copper colored bubbly with hints of cherry and raspberry in the ripe flavors, firm acidity to balance them and tiny bubbles to keep it all lively. Made with 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, it finishes with a slightly sweet sensation."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Weinrieder,27.5,91.5,"The concentration here is enormous, from low-yielding old vines. The wine has the characteristic pepper edge, but the creamy character, the ripe lychees and green plums, are all more dominant. At the end, a distinct spiciness shows through. Age ideally for 3–4 years. A gorgeous wine, its richness fuelled by the concentration that comes from old vines. The wine rolls opulently around the mouth, showing apricot flavors over almonds and spice. A final burst of freshness gives it a delicious lift."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Nino Franco,26.5,91.5,"Crisp and refreshing, this lovely sparkler offers sensations of white wild flowers, green apple, citrus and Bartlett pear. Vibrant acidity balances the creamy, elegantly foaming palate and gives it a dry, invigorating finish. Heady aromas of white spring flower and mature apple carry through to the creamy palate along with ripe pear and citrus notes. It's balanced, with vibrant acidity and an elegant perlage that lead into the dry, refreshing finish."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Mumm Napa,23.0,91.5,"The winery's signature sparkler, this blend of equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with touches of Pinot Gris and Pinot Meunier, dazzles in rounded oak and a soft texture marked by grapefruit zest and fresh nectarine. Crisp and vibrant, it becomes richer on the finish, showing a spark of honey-baked brioche. Floral in lemon blossom, this tastes of lemon peel, grapefruit and spicy gingerbread, its acidity persistent and uplifting. A bite of texture gives it heft without too much ripeness, finishing lean and crisp."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Hidalgo,15.0,91.5,"Licorice city on the nose, so much so that it smells like the real thing. In the mouth, it is thick as they come. Flavors of maple, white raisins and milk chocolate are in your face and delicious. Expect a syrupy wine that requires a knife to cut through. Still, it's a wonderful reflection of this generous, sweet-leaning grape. Ultraconcentrated and almost heavy on the nose, but not fully syrupy or leaden. Has a heavy disposition in the mouth, with brown sugar, caramel and other usual suspects making up the flavor profile. Creamy and chunky on the finish. Excellent dessert wine for the price."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,Delheim,30.0,91.0,"A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure. Flavors of cassis underly this, while the wood spices contribute their ribbon of flavor. This is an impressive wine, the flagship red from this estate founded by Spatz Sperling over 30 years ago."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade Grande,30.0,91.0,"This bottling shows a rich, wood-aged wine, full of ripe yellow and tropical fruits as well as rich toasty flavors. The wine is warm, rounded, spicy and with its impressive structure still developing, it has the potential to age well. The wine is named to celebrate the second Lança generation in charge at the estate. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,30.0,91.0,"Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking."
Scheurebe,Germany,Rheinhessen,Wittmann,30.0,91.0,"A surprising whiff of black currant on the nose of this elegant white points to Scheurebe—one of Germany's lesser-known grapes. Wittmann's version is particularly poised, offering loads of peach and grapefruit flavors, sharply contrasted by zesty lime and mineral tones. The finish is long and sleek, touched by a hint of bee pollen."
Bonarda,Argentina,Mendoza Province,El Enemigo,30.0,91.0,"Intriguing aromas of lavender, hoja santa and green tobacco blend nicely with blackberry and blueberry scents. This top-flight Bonarda feels lush and only moderately tannic. Blackberry, leather and mild briny flavors finish minty and lightly herbal. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Central Otago,Carrick,30.0,91.0,"Even Carrick's entry-level wine has turned out well in 2013, offering a sturdy, robust mouthful of dark fruit. Plum, espresso and dark chocolate mingle on the nose and palate, while the finish is long, faintly dusty and mouthwatering. Drink 2017–2025."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Purple Hands,30.0,91.0,"One of the best Stoller Vineyard designates from anywhere, this bright and spicy effort is bursting with flavors of red currants, accented with smoky chocolate. Tannins are fine tuned and the wine has excellent balance throughout."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette,30.0,91.0,"This wine from Château Lagrézette is powerful and dense in its own right. It has black, juicy, tar-like flavors with tannins concentrated into a dry, dark core. Blended with a small proportion of Merlot, there is just a touch of softness which will allow the wine to mature in the next 2–3 years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Miro,30.0,91.0,"This thick, concentrated wine offers complex notions of sandalwood and soapstone, savory in pleasant ways. Clove accents the warmth of strawberry compote laced in rhubarb."
Red Blend,US,California,Murrieta's Well,30.0,91.0,"An attractive, oaky perfume and melt-in-the-mouth fruit and dark-chocolate flavors make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. It has a luscious, mouth-coating texture, beautifully ripe blackberries and cherries, and a lingering finish."
Lambrusco di Sorbara,Italy,Central Italy,Paltrinieri,30.0,91.0,"Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, red berry and baking spice lift out of the glass. The bright savory palate offers strawberry, raspberry, wild cherry, and tangerine alongside zesty acidity and a firm, continuous perlage."
Chardonnay,Austria,Niederösterreich,Gruber Röschitz,30.0,91.0,"The nose is uncertain and hovers between musky botrytis and lactic tartness. The palate removes all doubt and shines with luscious, concentrated sweetness, referencing the pleasant bitterness of honeycomb and the spice of maple syrup. Pure lemon freshness illuminates everything. Drink now through 2025."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Vallana,30.0,91.0,"This fragrant blend of 70% Nebbiolo and 30% Vespolina opens with enticing scents of violet, rose, truffle and baking spice.

Glera,Italy,Veneto,Ca' dei Zago,30.0,91.0,"Made from 80-year-old Glera vines that have never been doused with herbicides or pesticides, this boasts an enticing floral fragrance of jasmine and honeysuckle. The elegant, reserved palate has a pristine quality, delivering green apple, lemon zest, nectarine, pastry cream, herb and mineral alongside a fine perlage. It finishes crisp and clean."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,El Enemigo,30.0,91.0,"Rubbery, foxy aromas of blueberry, blackberry, cured meats and spice are packed into an ideal whole. This Cab Franc is rich and flush in feel, with good acidity and balance. An herbal, saucy element accents core berry fruit, while the finish is full of coffee, chocolate, grilled meat and jammy berry flavors. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Gordon Brothers,30.0,91.0,"Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive."
Chardonnay,US,California,Cambria,30.0,91.0,"Part of a series that raises money for women working for justice in the world, this bottling that honors Dr. Victoria Kisyombe of Tanzania shows delicate lemon, lime zest, light marcona almond, popcorn and sandalwood nose on the complex nose. It is fresh and tightly wound on the palate, where citrus, chilled nectarine and a touch of salt cruise across strong acidity and a pithy texture."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,San Pedro,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of Italian herbs like basil and oregano blend with eucalyptus and black-fruit scents.

A well-balanced wine, with flavors that are equal parts fruity and savory, the finish boasts lingering tannins and bright acidity. Fine Terroir Selections, Misa Imports."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin,30.0,91.0,"From vines with an average age of 25 years, this concentrated wine is fruity and stylishly textured. With lively acidity balanced by tense minerality, it shows intense citrus and concentration. It will benefit from some aging, so drink from 2018."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Querciabella,30.0,91.0,"Alluring aromas of ripe plum, fragrant violet, menthol and baking spice emerge on this savory, enjoyable red. The juicy, easy-drinking palate combines an enticing weightless quality with succulent fruit including fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and chopped herb alongside round, polished tannins."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Tegernseerhof,30.0,91.0,"Aloe vera, green pear peel and ripe Mirabelle plums charm nose and palate on the soft and ripe palate. Despite the ripeness nothing is overdone and reaches a center of gravity."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,30.0,91.0,Tender notes of lemon on the nose segue into riper citrus notes on the palate.

Champagne Blend,France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre,30.0,91.0,"The minerality is a reminder that the grapes come from an area near Chablis. It has a tangy, zingy character, with a nervy edge that promises aging, but it also provides fruity, apple-driven pleasure now."
Monastrell,Spain,Levante,Nacido del Quórum,30.0,91.0,"Concentrated aromas of blackberry marmalade, wood grain, pepper and turned earth are rich and smooth. This is a dense, chewy, maximum-ripeness Monastrell, with flavors of baked blackberry, baking spices and chocolate. Toast and additional chocolate flavors drive the finish. Drink through 2019."
Riesling,US,New York,Anthony Road,30.0,91.0,"Penetrating notes of melon, stone fruit and white florals set apart this lavish Riesling from Anthony Road. Semisweet in style with honeyed fruit flavors, it's balanced by bracing lime acidity and crushed-stone minerality that extends the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Bouscaut,30.0,91.0,"A very structured, firm wine with excellent acidity and dark, dry tannins. The alcohol does show through, but the wine is firm and very dense, a big success from this Lurton family owned property."
Zinfandel,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,30.0,91.0,"Zesty in black pepper and luscious in blackberry, blueberry and raspberry, the grapes are from 90-plus-year-old hillside vines.

Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Thanisch,30.0,91.0,"While the nose is decidedly savory, wafting of herbs and bramble, the palate of this delicately lacy auslese bursts with juicy, peach and apricot nectar. Wax, honey and spice notes meld into a long finish, lifted by a streak of tangerine acidity."
Zweigelt,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Hans und Christine,30.0,91.0,"Wood aging has rounded out this wine's tannins and integrated its fruity character into something complex. It's big, rich and smooth, and with its tannins it will age several years."

A beautiful rancio characteristic leads, with aromas of walnut shell, orange oil and earthy spice fill the bouquet. Skin-driven fruit flavors of cherry and plum dominate the gripping palate, while the complex finish reveals accents of black tea, licorice root and baking spice."
Aglianico,US,California,West of Temperance,30.0,91.0,"Baked mulberry, light clove spice, cola and gingerbread show on the intriguingly distinctive and delicious nose of this bottling from a boutique producer. Spicy red cherries meet with cinnamon, tangy plum skins and an encompassing tannic grip on this expression of a rarely planted grape."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de la Concordia,30.0,91.0,"Floral aromas suggest rose hips, while lemony oak scents provide framing for earthy berry and cherry notes. This is reaching maturity; it's fresh and plush on the palate. Flavors of cherry, blackberry and coffee finish smooth and quick, with a touch of residual juicy acidity. Drink through 2020."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Minuty,30.0,91.0,"The palest pink-grey in color, this wine is light and based completely around crisp fruitiness. A buoyant, lively character gains some depth from lemon zest and spice. The aftertaste of this refreshing wine is tight and perfumed."
Malbec,US,Washington,Seven Hills,30.0,91.0,"Casey McClellan blended 15% Merlot into this vintage—the most ever—and has crafted a bright, sappy wine with vivid flavors of spiced apples and raspberries. There's a distinct scent of cinnamon, perhaps from the use of Hungarian oak barrels, (30% new.) Thoroughly delicious and surprisingly deep in this lighter vintage."
Grenache,US,Oregon,Jaxon,30.0,91.0,"The best vintage to date for this wine, delivering sharp well-defined varietal character. It's tight, tart and focused, mixing lemon, orange and cherry fruit with a well-built finish. No new oak, just half neutral and half twice-used barrels, but the highlights of toast and mocha latte add a nice touch to the tannins."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Little Giant,30.0,91.0,"Stony perfume welcomes one into this full, fleshy white adorned with peach and green apple fruit. Succulent on the midpalate, it delivers flavor and body with balance, finishing on a tart, lingering spark of key lime."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette,30.0,91.0,"Coming from high terraces above the River Lot, this wood-aged wine is cool, collected and stylish. It has ripe blackberry and currant fruits along with just the right amount of firm tannins. Acidity keeps everything fresh and fruity while guarding the structure. Drink from 2017."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Taron,30.0,91.0,"Foresty blackberry aromas come with a cola note and a dash of char. This feels full and rich, with wall-to-wall tannins. A mix of baked berry fruits and soy sauce flavors finishes with mild leather and lasting savory notes. Drink through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Leconfield,30.0,91.0,"This mature, ready-to-drink example of Coonawarra Cab offers complex aromas and flavors of leather, cedar and black cherry, plus hints of mint and roasted beef. The tannins are smooth, the mouthfeel moderately rich and the finish long and mouthwatering. Drink now-2015."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Chasselay,30.0,91.0,"Organically grown grapes have yielded a firm, dense wine that brings out the power of Morgon. It has dark plum skins and cherry fruit, layered with firmly structured tannins. It's an impressive wine for aging 2–3 years."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Mersiol,30.0,91.0,A lovely notion of ripe mirabelle and clean citrus makes for an appealing nose. The palate highlights the mirabelle with a honeyed rich sweetness that is juicy and appetizing. A touch of spice seems reminiscent of dark fir honey. The lemon brightens and invigorates this full-fruited richness. The finish is long and medium-sweet.
Riesling,US,Oregon,Argyle,30.0,91.0,"Round rather than racy, this fruity effort rings out with peach, melon and papaya flavors. It's finished dry with just 4g/L residual sugar, and the delicious finish has a honeysuckle note."
Gewürztraminer,US,New York,Keuka Spring,30.0,91.0,"Slicks of butter, cream and spice in this unusual barrel-fermented Gewürztraminer may evoke divisive love-it-or-hate-it reactions, but the intensity and quality of this deeply concentrated wine is hard to deny. It's gorgeously fruity and floral, bursting of honeysuckle, rose petals and melons, yet elegantly balanced in acidity and alcohol. It's deeply penetrating, with reverberating waves of bright citrus notes and a lingering tea-toned astringency. Drinks well now, but should be an interesting wine to mature over the next decade."
Primitivo,US,California,Philo Ridge,30.0,91.0,"Beautifully balanced and quietly powerful, this full-bodied wine poises plenty of berry and dark plum flavors on a smooth, sophisticated texture that carries all that fruit through the finish. It's dry, and that's a plus for pairing with most food."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Chauvin,30.0,91.0,"The second label of classed growth Château Chauvin, this wine is structured yet bears all the fruit that is characteristic of the vintage. Finely balanced, its acidity and black fruit flavors work together to create a wine that needs to age further. Best from 2020."
Red Blend,Chile,Maipo Valley,Santa Alicia,30.0,91.0,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is the best wine from Santa Alicia I've come across. The nose is spicy, dry and delivers earthy cherry and plum aromas. It feels right and tastes of spicy raspberry and plum, with a fruity, complex finish. A good wine for food with nice acidity; drink now–2015."
Chardonnay,US,California,Joullian,30.0,91.0,"There's a strong nose on this single-vineyard from a reliable appellation in the middle of Monterey County, with white floral, crispy apple and light honey aromas. It's zesty with tongue-singeing acidity, showing flavors of dried apples, lime juice and honeydew melon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,New York,McGregor,30.0,91.0,"Complexity abounds on this spicy cedar-toned Cabernet Sauvignon. Ripe red-plum and cherry flavors are juicy and plush yet balanced briskly by sharp edges of acidity and graphite. It's intensely earthy, studded with notes of bramble and autumn leaf. Fine feathery tannins lead a long lingering finish."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Zorzal,30.0,91.0,"Dry, earthy plum, cherry, tomato and leather aromas are fresh but also a touch hard and harsh. This cement-egg-fermented Cab Franc features a medium body and cutting acidity. Raw red-plum and red-berry flavors finish tight, crisp and short. Drink this juicy, monoline red through 2020."
Barbera,US,California,Miraflores,30.0,91.0,"This especially ripe and deep style of Barbera grown at the Miraflores property looks quite dark, smells like dried fruit and tastes rich and full-bodied. It has admirable concentration, a smooth and layered texture and good length on the finish."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Terre Rouge,30.0,91.0,"Well-polished and well-structured, this deep-colored, full-bodied wine blends ripe blackberry and black cherry notes with sophisticated oak nuances reminiscent of cardamom, cinnamon and wood smoke. The texture is firmly tannic and nicely supports the unusually generous fruit flavors."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tulpen,30.0,91.0,"Deep and refined, this beautifully integrated Syrah opens with scents of briar, berry, and cherry. Details of light pepper, iron and earth are buoyed by vivid acids. Complex, aromatic and graceful."
Loin de l'Oeil,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,30.0,91.0,"Classic botrytis sweet and dry flavors bring out the rich honey and lemon juice. The wine also has freshness, a tight edge of orange and sweet chutney spice. A great example of sweet Gaillac."
Syrah,US,Washington,Walter Dacon,30.0,91.0,"Rich and toasty, this is a swirl of mocha and raspberry doing a lovely pas de deux. It's sharp and focused, a little high-toned, and thoroughly delicious."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,30.0,91.0,"Made from grapes sourced from the Gebling Vineyard, this has broad, ripe yellow fruit and a touch of spice. With its rich mouthfeel, it is a serious wine, both complex and intense. Age for at least a year. Screwcap."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Gassier,30.0,91.0,"This is complex, ripe and full of sweet raspberry fruit. Impressive and dense, it's balanced with acidity and a tense tannic structure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Langmeil,30.0,91.0,"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a terrific value in Barossa Cabernet. And it's no simple fruity concoction, either. Instead, it delivers complex notes of grilled meat, coffee and black olive layered easily over a base of dark plums. Finishes long, velvety and mouthwatering; drink now–2020."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,30.0,91.0,"Beckoningly ripe, yellow pear with overtones of yellow plum unite in a very juicy, refreshing and lively white which slowly reveals layers of savory, peppery spice. The streamlined body remains toned despite its undoubted concentration. Ready now but will definitely keep."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Nervi,30.0,91.0,"Intense aromas suggest violet, rose, perfumed berry, leather and spice, with balsamic notes. The focused palate delivers sour cherry, crushed raspberry, leather, mineral and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's balanced with nice depth. Drink 2016–2028."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,30.0,91.0,"A rich wine that shows ripe intensity as well as forward fruitiness. It has a ripe, creamy texture, and hints of spice and vanilla along with a steely acidity. Full in the mouth, it's packed with pepper as well as fruit. This is a dense wine that could age another year. Screwcap."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,30.0,91.0,"A clever play on words, this powerful wine is rich, complex, and a shade off dry from its ripe fruit profile. It has intense juiciness with loads of apple and pear flavor and just a touch of pepper. Full-bodied and worth aging for 2–4 years. Screwcap."
Viognier,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,30.0,91.0,"The aromas of peach, flowers, lemon, lees and barrel spices are alluring and nuanced. The medium-weight flavors are tart and spritely, with a citrus and lees streak running throughout."
Zinfandel,US,California,Saucelito Canyon,30.0,91.0,"Plump blueberry, baked black plum, cracked-rock earthiness and bloody meats show in a reserved way on the nose of this bottling from one of California's oldest vineyards. The sip begins with dark strawberry and ripe red-cherry notes but is quickly consumed by chalky tannins and lively acidity that unleash a wave of white pepper and cola into the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Yealands,30.0,91.0,"Dense and rich on the palate, this shows the concentration achieved in this coastal location. Snap pea, pineapple and nectarine elements combine for a harmonious whole that lingers on the finish, picking up more austere hints of wet stone. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Diora,30.0,91.0,"This is a powerful Pinot Noir that jumps toward the nose with black raspberry and other dark fruits as well as strong cedar and caramel aromas. Thick raspberry and rounded cherry flavors show on the sip, which enjoys strong and compelling spice notes of clove, star anise and even some licorice. Pair with steak."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Central Otago,Rockburn,30.0,91.0,"A solid value in the world of Pinot Noir, this is pleasantly complex on the nose, offering up hints of cola, root beer and green herbs layered over dark fruit aromas. On the palate, it's reasonably full bodied and supple, delivering savory, earthy notes without being inaccessible. Mocha and silk soften the finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Matthews,30.0,91.0,"Because he blends shortly after fermentation, Matt Loso's wines attain a seamless complexity early on; it's a hallmark of the winery. This beautifully crafted Claret has no rough edges; in fact, no edges at all. It is a supple, elegant wine, loaded with fruit flavors that run from berry to cherry to plum, while the oak gently adds spice and toast."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Cederberg,Cederberg,30.0,91.0,"A delicate, floral white, this offers immediate aromas of orange blossom and honeysuckle that accent the white melon and apple fruit tones. The linear palate is well cut with laser-like precision through the green plum and apple flavors, followed by a kiss of toast on finish."
Syrah,Spain,Northern Spain,Pagos del Moncayo,30.0,91.0,"This Syrah is big, rubbery and heavily charred on the nose, with iodine and minerally notes kicking in. The palate is deep but not too heavy, with juicy acidity. Flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and spice finish toasty, with licorice and espresso notes. Drink now through 2018."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,El Enemigo,30.0,91.0,"Ripe berry, cassis and grilled meat aromas presage a fresh, zesty palate with free-flowing acidity that pumps up cherry, red plum, cassis and loamy earth flavors. It stays fruity, stout and smooth on the finish. The wine is ripe and fully representative of Mendoza and winemaker Alejandro's Vigil's style."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Western Cape,Jean Daneel,30.0,91.0,"Toasty peach and guava notes unfold on the bouquet, followed by secondary hints of orange essence, woody spice, peach pit and honeycomb. Round and smooth, this shows a certain decadence on the palate. Lush tropical and melon notes are spiced by touches of vanilla and sweet spice but finish clean and mouthwatering. Drink now–2016."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Pamplin,30.0,91.0,"Thoughtfully made and sourced from two excellent vineyards—Walla Walla's Seven Hills and Canoe Ridge in the Horse Heaven Hills American Viticultural Area—this is 75% Merlot, with smaller portions of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Black cherry, black olive, clean earth and fine tannins mark its passage across the palate. This has excellent balance and medium-term ageability."
Riesling,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,30.0,91.0,"This delicious wine smells very fresh, like putting your nose into a fruit salad. It tastes more dry, like lemons and crisp apples. Medium bodied, it offers good acidity and appetizing balance."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Château d'Azur,30.0,91.0,"As is right for a Bandol, Mourvèdre is the dominant grape in this rich wine. It is spicy from the same wood aging that also gives a mint-chocolate flavor to the powerful red-plum and berry fruits. The wine is still young, still firm. Drink from 2019."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Launa,30.0,91.0,"Blackberry, black cherry, earth and rubbery scents create a blunt, dense bouquet. This is round and full in body, with solid tannins balanced by fleshy, fruity depth. Dark plum, cassis and raspberry flavors linger on an earthy finish with toast and cola notes. Best enjoyed 2017–2022"
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine les Pins,30.0,91.0,"A structured wine with tannins from wood aging, as well as rich blackberry fruit. The wine has fruit and structural intensity, layering spice and juiciness atop a dry core. Keep for 3–5 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Parducci,30.0,91.0,"With excellent concentration and a firm, dry texture, this is a serious wine that's tempting to drink now but will be better after 2018. It smells slightly cedary and black-cherry-like, and tastes deep and ripe but not at all sweet. It will be waiting in the cellar for a good occasion with a choice cut of meat."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Château Vitallis,30.0,91.0,"From vines aged between 40 and 80 years, this is a lightly wood-aged wine, with yellow fruits that go with the spicy toast. Full, ripe, and nicely cut with acidity, it has a creamy, smooth texture. Drink now."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Christophe Cordier,30.0,91.0,"There is a fine touch of spice in this wine. Bright and tangy, it is also full with white fruits, ripe acidity and a warm while zesty character. Still young and zesty, the wine will soften over the next few months into something more rounded. Drink from 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Four Sisters Ranch,30.0,91.0,"A rich and inviting nose of berry-laced pastries, dried strawberries, stewed cherries and sagebrush kick off this layered bottling. The palate shows savory cracked black pepper along with strawberry, plum and black-raspberry fruit. A dry sagebrush quality gives complexity to the whole sip."
Syrah,US,California,Morse,30.0,91.0,"This rich and full-bodied wine is a great candidate for aging. Stash it away in a cool place until at least 2018 when its slightly rough and drying tannins should begin to mellow and let all the ripe fruit and complex spice flavors come out. It's blended with a touch of Mourvèdre for a spicy, earthy accent."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Row Eleven,30.0,91.0,"This likable wine has juicy and bright core, a mix of spicy cola-cherry and forest floor nested in firm, integrated tannins that works seamlessly on the palate. A full-bodied wine, it has power and grace."
Pinot Noir,Australia,Tasmania,Maison L'Envoyé,30.0,91.0,"For a cool-climate Pinot Noir, this is ripe, rich and round. Its ample weight delivers broad, complex flavors of clove, cinnamon, black cherry, plum and cola, but its oaky overcoat may dissuade purists. Although the fruit comes from Tasmania, the wine was made on the mainland at Giant Steps in the Yarra Valley. Drink now–2023."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Chateau La Tour Carnet,30.0,91.0,"The ancient vineyard of Tour Carnet, first planted in the 15th century, is into a renaissance. This wine, which showed too many tannins when in barrel, is now coming to life. The balance, the acidity and the seductive perfumes promise plenty. So does the structure, just hinting at bitterness, a function of its youthfulness. Keep for 5–8 years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Jäger,30.0,91.0,"The archetypal pear flavors of Grüner Veltliner come to the fore: fresh, flavorsome and crunchy green Conference pear in this case, with zesty acidity in a linear, refreshing and zesty frame. This is concentrated and totally refreshing."
Red Blend,Chile,San Antonio,Matetic,30.0,91.0,"Meaty, smoky aromas include whiffs of black coffee, tire rubber and blackberry. A tight, rubbery palate shows full but elastic tannins along with blackberry and oaky flavors of vanilla and wood resin. Ripe and muscular, the blend shows strong barrel influences. Drink through 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Concha y Toro,30.0,91.0,"Minerally citrus aromas are the greeting on this high-end, pure SB. Stony minerality and citric acidity make for a fresh, polished mouthfeel, while flavors of lime, passion fruit and grapefruit are focused and smooth, and not at all soft. When people talk about fine cool-climate Chilean SB, this is what they should be referencing."
Veltliner,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,30.0,91.0,"Full-bodied and elegant, it discloses aromas of white spring flowers, aromatic herbs and stone fruit. The juicy palate offers tart green apple, yellow peach, ripe cantaloupe, white pepper and mint alongside crisp acidity. The lingering finish closes on an energizing mineral note."
Chardonnay,US,California,Center of Effort,30.0,91.0,"This wine hails from an estate that dates back to 1978, but was more recently purchased by San Luis Obispo developer Rob Rossi and Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson. They assembled a “dream team” of grower Kevin Wilkinson (of Talley Vineyards and Coastal Vineyard Services) and winemakers Mike Sinor and Nathan Carlson. The wine boasts a lifting nose of cream, hazelnut and baked apples, then dances across the palate with lemon-zest and flint flavors."
Spätburgunder,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,30.0,91.0,"This wine shows the riper, spicier side to German Pinot Noir. Lush black cherry and plum flavors are fleshy and dense on the palate, tinged with notes of cassis and bramble. Crisp acidity adds elegance and structure, along with a penetrating layer of finely textured tannins. Drink now for its bold, decadent style."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Bègue-Mathiot,30.0,91.0,"Fermented and aged in tank, the wine is nothing but simply attractive pure ripe fruit. It has density and concentration that come from the generous apple and yellow-fruit flavors. At the same time, the wine is cut by delicious acidity and minerality. Drink this wine from 2018."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Tablas Creek,30.0,91.0,"This blend of 26% Viognier, 25% Grenache Blanc, 25% Marsanne and 24% Roussanne manages to be both lush and light, showing candied melon, clover honey, pretty green pear and lime-butter on the nose. The palate offers Gala apples and fresh lemon zest, yet retains and intriguingly savory quality throughout the sip."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sarah's Vineyard,30.0,91.0,"A rich nose of vanilla-bean ice cream, Marcona almond, buttered cornbread and pan-seared pear makes for a very inviting entry to this bottling. The vanilla and caramel flavors extend to the palate, but in a judiciously light way, with candied pecans, baked fruit and honeysuckle flavors, altogether quite delicious."
Merlot,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of spice, red fruit and milk chocolate are followed by an opulent palate of fruit and barrel flavors. It appeals on every level."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Fielding Hills,30.0,91.0,"A signature wine for this winery, it's elegant in style with notes of cocoa, cherry, herbs and nut oil. The palate is light, soft and silky in feel with tart acids bringing the fruit flavors into vivid focus."
Zinfandel,US,California,Terra d'Oro,30.0,91.0,"This wine is polished in texture, sophisticated in flavor and a pleasure to sip. It exudes plum and blackberry aromas, adds rich plummy flavors and almost coats the mouth with richness. While full bodied, it has enough complexity and finesse for special occasions."
Red Blend,US,California,Tres Sabores,30.0,91.0,"Chocolaty, this fun blend of 56% Zinfandel, 31% Petite Sirah, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Petit Verdot hails from estate, dry-farmed vineyards. Big, mountainous tannins soften in the glass to reveal juicy notes of dark and red cherry."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Matthews,30.0,91.0,"This vineyard-designated Sauv Blanc is half fermented in stainless steel, 40% in concrete eggs and the rest in French oak. It is completely different from the winery's Columbia Valley bottling, with much riper and rounder fruit flavors showing off stone fruits, such as peaches and apricots, along with tropical hints of papaya. There's plenty of stuffing and spice, and a perfect mix of the grape's innate herbaceous and grassy qualities, ramped up with riper, sweeter fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Matthews Estate,30.0,91.0,"The Claret is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling in the other half, and is quite firm, sappy and muscular. It is tightly structured with cassis, black cherry and plenty of dark, tarry undertones. The herbal aspects show in some black olive and black tea flavors; the tannins are strong and supple, and the wine has a sinuous finish suggesting both strength and length. An exceptional value, this wine should age very nicely."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,L'Oliveto,30.0,91.0,"From high-elevation vineyards in both Knights Valley and Sonoma Mountain, this is a well-crafted, integrated and deal of a wine, the grapes grown in volcanic, rocky soils. Crisp red currant confronts a tension of firm tannin and medium-body, remaining bright and seamless on the palate. Stock up for regular consumption."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Órale,30.0,91.0,"A small project by Carr Winery cellarmaster Chris Wright, this 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah is vivacious on the nose with bright pomegranate, nearly effervescent black cherry, iced coffee and inviting fruit punch aromas. There's a sliver of tar to the sip, but mostly suave black and red plum fruit, exotic bergamot tang and Chinese five spice complexity."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Clos Pons,30.0,91.0,"This blend of Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo opens with leathery, earthy aromas that suggest coffee grinds, black olive and stalky berry fruits. In the mouth, it comes through with a dense, layered feel and spicy flavors of baked berry fruits and black cherry. Overall this is a ripe, chewy, spicy wine with some rusticity. Drink through 2022."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Soos Creek,30.0,91.0,"Hailing from Slide Mountain and Dineen vineyards, this wine charms with aromas of flowers, toast, clove, cardamom and anise. The pillowy-feeling flavors show richness, depth and detail."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Sineann,30.0,91.0,"Smooth and chocolaty, this blend of grapes from Columbia Valley vineyards is drinking at its peak. The mix of black fruits, coffee grounds, toast and chocolate is balanced, with no sharp edges. The barrel flavors are delicious, though ultimately they may overwhelm the fruit. Seductive and delicious."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Gerd Anselmann,30.0,91.0,"Saffron and orange rind lend spicy zest to honey and floral tones on this gorgeously rich auslese. It's luscious, with sweet yellow peach and caramel flavors, but struck with a clean line of tangerine acidity. Bold and powerful in concentration, it finishes with just a hint of tea-leaf astringency."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Vistalba,30.0,91.0,"This starts out tarry, but airing reveals aromas of tobacco, asphalt and oaky berry fruits. The mouthfeel is flush and extracted, but not overly heavy. Flavors of black fruits are more generic than specific, while the finish is tannic, with lively acidity. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda."
Syrah,US,Oregon,Watermill,30.0,91.0,"The instantly recognizable label, sporting a bright green praying mantis on a plain brown background, is a quirky choice for a fine, estate-grown reserve. The fruit reaches blackberry concentration, with stiff, ripe tannins swathed in dark chocolate. Hints of earth and stem fade out through a lingering finish. It's already drinking well but could be cellared until 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,30.0,91.0,"Minerally, earthy aromas of plum and blackberry are oaky and attractive. This is round and well balanced, with cassis, blackberry, spice and herbal flavors settling on a spicy finish led by cardamom and clove notes as well as a smooth feel. Drink through 2017."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Jean Sipp,30.0,91.0,"The promise of aromatic, ripe stone fruit is immediately evident: vine-ripened peach and baked apple are lush and perfumed. The palate is equally fruitful, but tempered by dryness and a stony, taut and structured background. This is clean and poised and is ready now but will develop beautifully until 2020."
Zinfandel,US,California,Fields Family,30.0,91.0,"The color is light, which is natural for the variety, while aromas are lightly fruity, earthy and tobacco-like. Bright raspberry and cranberry flavors come with cedar and dried-herb accents that add complexity. It's medium bodied, well balanced and light in tannins, with a very appetizing texture."
Chardonnay,US,California,Groth,30.0,91.0,"From a relatively cool hillside site within the Oak Knoll District, this wine dances in lemon and green apple, completely crisp atop a fuller-bodied style embraced in oak. Luxurious on the palate, it finishes with a bite of salty brine."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Gump Markus Prackwieser,30.0,91.0,"Enticing aromas of Alpine wildflower, rennet apple and a whiff of aromatic herb unfold on this sleek, radiant white. The vibrant, elegant palate offers creamy Anjou pear, white peach and lemon-lime energized by a mineral vein and firm acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Rust en Vrede,30.0,91.0,"Attractive fragrances of mulled berries, cassis and black cherry lead the fruity bouquet of this wine, with added interest from supporting notes of sweet smoke, pepper and licorice root. The mouthfeel is creamy and full, but with ample tannin and acidity to provide structure and lend a gripping texture. Ripe flavors of plum, fig, cassis, black tea and leather flood the palate and linger long on the finish. Drink now–2018."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,30.0,91.0,"This is a 100% varietal selection, with most of the fruit coming from Weinbau Vineyard. It brings an assortment of barrel notes—including mocha, cedar and char from 20% new French oak—and varietal flavors of cherry, flowers and herbs. It starts out lighter in style, fleshing out over time with tart acidity providing a lift."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,Andrea Felici,30.0,91.0,"This opens with a heady floral fragrance of hawthorne and Spanish broom, with a whiff of stone fruit. It has delicious flavors of creamy peach, lemon and mineral alongside Verdicchio's unique salinity. Peter/Warren Selections, Augustan Wine Imports."
Zinfandel,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,30.0,91.0,"Perfumed and lovely, this hearty full-bodied wine evokes berry pie, so rich and brambly is its depth of concentrated flavor. Rapturous, it finds its savory side with an intensity of cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper."
Zinfandel,US,California,MacLeod,30.0,91.0,"Sanguine, with a voluptuous mouthfeel, this wine is soft and integrated in chewy sticky tannins that resolve in the glass, and dusty in dried herb. Blackberry bramble adds a fruity edge that finds companionship in the boldly etched fruit."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Ribeirinha,30.0,91.0,"This perfumed and solid wine offers some fine tannins. The black fruits and rich structure give a juicy concentration. Named after the wolves who traditionally lived in the valley where the quinta is situated, this wine is ripe and ready to drink."
Touriga Nacional Blend,Portugal,Duriense,Quinta da Romaneira,30.0,91.0,"When two naturally perfumed grapes get together they make an intense wine that has big aromas as well as a series of firm tannins and ripe fruit. Blackberry and spice are shot through with acidity to give a solid wine, firmly structured and fruity at the end."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tiefenbrunner,30.0,91.0,"This opens with aromas of chamomile flower, crushed tomato vine and cut grass. The vibrant elegant palate delivers white peach, grapefruit, chopped herb and lemon zest alongside racy acidity."
Syrah,US,California,Firestone,30.0,91.0,"This study of a low-yielding clone produced a compelling range of aromas and flavors. The nose leads with iodine, seaweed and coffee scents against a backdrop of tangy black fruit. The palate shows more nori, lavender, black pepper, asphalt and dried blackberry flavor, finishing on a lingering oaky note."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Ironstone,30.0,91.0,"Big, bold and tannic, this layered and nicely ripe wine is an iron fist in a velvet glove. It smells like espresso and dark chocolate, tastes equally roasted and rich, but backs its darker flavors with blueberry and blackberry notes, finishing smooth. Best after 2019."
Red Blend,Israel,Judean Hills,Shiloh Winery,30.0,91.0,"Deep garnet in the glass, this wine delivers aromas of black cherry and chocolate. There is a good mix of fruit and savory flavors in a bed of chewy tannins, featuring blackberry, plum, white chocolate, tobacco and anise. Bright fruit and light spice carry into the lingering finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Brian Carter Cellars,30.0,91.0,"Compact and chewy, with clearly delineated Bordeaux style and character. Cassis and black cherry fruit; stiff, earthy tannins, good length and fine aging potential. The acids and tannins are in good proportion, and the fruit is not overtaken with new oak, but there is enough (40%) to frame it with some sweet spices."
Petit Verdot,Portugal,Alentejano,Azamor,30.0,91.0,"It's very rare to find a 100% Petit Verdot, the Bordeaux variety that adds a percentage or two of spice to wines in the Médoc. The color is dark, almost black, while the wine's tannins are sweet, chocolaty and flavored with toasty spice. With its big blackberry jam texture, this is dense and solid, a powerful, ripe wine."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre,30.0,91.0,"On the steely, taut side of Chablis, this is a wine for aging. It has fine complexity, lemon and green plum flavors vying with a buttery edge. Keep for 3–4 years."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Minho,Aveleda,30.0,91.0,"Almost tropical in flavor, this is a rich style of Alvarinho. It comes from the vineyards around the house of Quinta da Aveleda. Some wood aging has given the wine extra weight and richness as well as allowing it to age. At the end, the acidity and toast combine beautifully. Drink from 2016."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,CVNE,30.0,91.0,"Lightly charred and oaky on first take, this traditional Rioja features vanilla scents on top of red plum and raspberry aromas. A juicy, fresh, tight palate tastes of old-school American oak blended with plum, raspberry and woodspice. A dry, juicy, peppery finish is fitting for this wine. Drink through 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Smith Haut Lafitte,30.0,91.0,"This is a ripe soft wine full of warm fruits and gentle tannins. The second wine of the always-impressive Château Smith Haut Lafitte, it is a rich wine its own right. With black currant and dark plum flavors, it has some solid tannins from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,US,Washington,Efeste,30.0,91.0,"The aromas bring a big whack of pungent blue and purple fruit, along with notes of herb and cherry. The flavors are full and palate coating, bringing a real sense of texture and hedonism but still with great freshness."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Te Mata,30.0,91.0,"A classic expression of Hawke's Bay Sauvignon Blanc, this is a ripe, open-knit wine tinged with barrel influence. Vanilla and tangerine mingle with hints of smoke, lingering elegantly on the long finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Luigi Bosca,30.0,91.0,"Initial charred aromas yield to aggressive cherry and maple scents. This is a wide, fully tannic load of a Malbec with toasty flavors of burnt wheat bread and maple to go with blackberry and cassis. Toast remains on the finish, which also tastes of licorice. Drink through 2023."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Ronco del Gelso,30.0,91.0,"Elderflower, hay, exotic fruit and tomato vine aromas leap out of the glass. The bright delicious palate shows honeydew melon, creamy white peach and grapefruit. Fresh acidity lifts the rich juicy flavors."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Steininger,30.0,91.0,"A touch of citrus and herb on the nose points to the varietal character of Grüner Veltliner. The palate confirms this with a yeasty, savory tinge so typical for this variety. Frothing bubbles heighten these sensations on a light, dry and full-flavored body. This wine belongs on the table with food, thanks to its long aftertaste and strong presence."
Merlot,US,Washington,Goose Ridge,30.0,91.0,This excellent estate-grown Merlot is a standout in the current Goose Ridge lineup. A scent of violet introduces a dark and potent wine. Plum and black cherry are enhanced by streaks of rock and tar. The tannins are supple and substantial.
Syrah,US,California,Bernat,30.0,91.0,"Beef teriyaki, lavender, lilacs, black pepper, smoked meat and blueberry jam combine for a dynamic nose. The palate is also very much the full Syrah package: black pepper dust, blackberry fruit, soy, charcoal, teriyaki-plum sauce, contained by both strong tannic structure and zesty acidity."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Bridge Press,30.0,91.0,"This wine hails from a new vineyard region high above famed Seven Hills. Baking spice, cocoa and herb aromas are followed by focused black-fruit flavors, with espresso and vanilla notes that linger. It captures the attention."
Chardonnay,US,California,Falcone,30.0,91.0,"Warm touches of lemon-laced chamomile tea, soft butter and a dollop of orange sherbert show on the nose of this intriguing and unique wine from the Sierra Madre Vineyard. There's a strong sense of baking soda-like alkalinity to the palate, laced through juicy lemon and tangerine flavors, pithy grip, slate minerality and a mouth-watering combo of acidity and salt."
Chardonnay,US,California,Freemark Abbey,30.0,91.0,"Aged in stainless steel and small barrels of French oak, this wine remains smooth and silky with interweaved acidity, a classic, fresh expression of the variety with very subtle oak. Vanilla and pear find their way onto the finish, providing additional layers of flavor and finesse."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Jackson Estate,30.0,91.0,"Supple and full-bodied, this wine offers ample aromas and flavors of ripe cherries, supported by hints of cedar and vanilla. It's not super complex, but is a bold, flavorful wine with a softly dusty, lingering finish."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Eisold-Smith,30.0,91.0,"Some wines fall outside the tasting box, and this is one of those. Intense, rich and distinctive—it's not your father's Chardonnay. Spontaneous fermentation (through native yeast) contributes to the texture and density. Concentrated fruit suggests nectarines, Meyer lemon and candied oranges just on the edge of being overripe. Drink now through 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Lancaster,30.0,91.0,"This white is barrel fermented and then aged further sur lie in a mix of French oak, stainless steel and concrete egg, with the goal of additional texture and complexity coming into play. It does, the wine intoxicating in floral apple blossom and honeysuckle, with a taste of crisp, refreshing lemon and grapefruit. Light bodied, it doesn't hold back on mouthfeel, offering richness without overripeness."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Panther Creek,30.0,91.0,"Here is a powerful mix of tart berry and pungent herb, that punches through with authority. It picks up fresh blackberry fruit and a lick of licorice as it powers through to a polished and persistent finish."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Loimer,30.0,91.0,"A lovely rich apple scent of Golden Pearmain pervades nose and palate of this fresh sparkler. The palate is fresh and light-bodied, yet characterized by an almost honeyed richness of apple notes and freshly baked apple crumble. The finish is wonderfully dry, full-fruited, fresh and long."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Castra Rubra,30.0,91.0,"This Bulgarian red blend is produced under the supervision of flying winemaker Michele Rolland. It consists of 60% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc. It has aromas of black raspberry, black plum and a touch of graphite. In the mouth, there are flavors of dark cherry, blackberry and pomegranate with chewy tannins and a pleasantly tart finish."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Le Macchiole,30.0,91.0,"Made from Merlot, Cabernet and Syrah, it has a soft but elegant palate. Fleshy black cherry, blackberry and spicy blueberry are accented with notes of white pepper and clove alongside smooth, silky tannins. Enjoy this soon."
Muscat Canelli,US,California,La Sirena,30.0,91.0,"Almost clear in color, this wine has pungently floral aromas of honeysuckle that pave the way for sizzling acidity and fresh layers of peach and lime zest to complement one another on the palate. Refreshing, light bodied and dry, this is a wonderful additional to any arsenal of aromatic wines for summertime enjoyment."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Weingut Hans Bausch,30.0,91.0,"While demure on the nose, the palate of this off-dry Riesling explodes with mouthwatering flavors of tangerine, grapefruit and peach. Kisses of honey and caramel on the midpalate are calibrated neatly by strikes of lemon-lime acidity and a clean, mineral finish. Drink now through 2025 for it's youthful vitality."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Tranche,30.0,91.0,"This blend of Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier displays aromas of almond, corn husk and apricot. There's a pleasing, nuanced feel to the sweet, full-bodied fruit flavors along with a finish that won't quit."
Zinfandel,US,California,Klinker Brick,30.0,91.0,"There's no denying the concentration of this full-bodied, lavishly textured wine. It pulses with ripe blackberry and boysenberry from the aroma through the flavors and into the lingering finish. Delicious new American oak flavors lend complexity without overwhelming the taste of the grapes."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,30.0,91.0,"A lovely fresh blast of citrus foliage rises from the glass. The palate carries the same fragrant freshness but holds warmth and strength at its core, despite the dry taut body. This is the sunshine and the richness of 2015 captured with a light touch. The finish is dry and refreshing."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Poças,30.0,91.0,"This is a ripe complex wine made from a blend of Douro grapes. With French and American wood aging, there is a smooth texture that is lifted by spice. The acidity, the black-currant fruits and rich feel of the wine all promise some good aging. Drink from late 2018."
Marsanne,US,California,Langtry,30.0,91.0,"Not many varietal Marsannes are made in California, and this one is impressive. Savory, earthy nuances—rather than fruity ones—dominate, giving it a distinctive flavor profile. It starts with dried herb and mineral aromas, brings in fennel bulb and white pepper flavors and wraps it all with a luscious texture that powers a long, lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,30.0,91.0,"A 100% varietal wine coming from Block 14 of this up-and-coming vineyard, it has a lot of appeal with notes of dark-brewed coffee, chocolate, cherries and black raspberries. Aged 18 months in half new French oak, it's silky, soft, and supple, showing a lot of polish and restraint."
Aglianico,US,California,Prima Materia,30.0,91.0,"This wine has a big personality. It's dark in color and oozing with ripe black-cherry flavors that intermingle with a high level of tannin for that lip-smacking tooth-staining effect. So approach with caution, and then enjoy for all its boisterous impact."
Monastrell,Spain,Levante,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega,30.0,91.0,"Composed and not the least bit pushy or punishing on the bouquet, this has gorgeous berry and spice aromas. It feels a bit racy and high in acidity, but that will only serve the wine well in the long run. Plum and boysenberry flavors lead to a racy, high-acid finish. Drink now–2020."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Norton,30.0,91.0,"Spunky right off the bat, this has floral and fresh fruit aromas that fall squarely into the wild berry category. It feels lively on the palate, with spiked acidity but enough weight and depth to absorb it. This tastes like a mix of plum, blackberry and chocolate, and the finish darkens up with notes of pepper and spice. Drink now–2017."
Cabernet Blend,Chile,Rapel Valley,Altaïr,30.0,91.0,"All this Cab blend needs is time in the glass and it'll show floral, alluring aromas and then big raspberry and plum flavors. It starts quietly and then pounds through with saturated fruit, chocolate and firm tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,30.0,91.0,"Parts of Clare Valley are ideal for Cabernet Sauvignon, illustrated by this reasonably priced bottling. Mint and cassis show remarkable purity on the nose, while the palate is properly restrained without being hard or austere. That said, there are some dusty tannins on the finish, so drink 2020–2030."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Lenné Estate,30.0,91.0,"This fruit-forward, entry level release is nonetheless all estate grown and spent just under a year in French oak. It's a supple flavorful mix of plum and cherry fruit, accented with iron filings, lead pencil and dark chocolate."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Willamette Valley Vineyards,30.0,91.0,"This lush, toasty, vividly fruity wine can't miss with a wide variety of seafood, pasta and poultry dishes. There's plenty of acid under full-bodied apple and melon and peach fruit. The acids carry a nice touch of citrus and that clean fresh fruit continues on through a medium-long finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,:Nota Bene,30.0,91.0,"For the first time these excellent grapes are being shown in a single-vineyard cuvée. It's a big, tannic, high-octane wine, with smooth, ripe and generous purple fruits. There is plenty of supporting acid, along with rather astringent tannins that carry a leafy note through the finish. Drink now–2019."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Five Star Cellars,30.0,91.0,"Brooding aromas of pomegranate, strawberry and spice lead to tart cranberry and raspberry flavors that display exceptional balance, detail and length, with high-wire acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Pamplin,30.0,91.0,"Cabernet Sauvignon (71%) makes up the majority of this blend, which also includes Merlot (25%) and pinches of Malbec and Petit Verdot. Complex aromas of potting soil, green pepper, graphite, herbs, blackberry, licorice and barrel spices are followed by focused black-fruit flavors with light coffee accents."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Syncline,30.0,91.0,"The fruit for this wine comes nearly equally from Red Mountain and Horse Heaven Hills (Alder Ridge, Force Majeure and Heart of the Hill vineyards). Jammy raspberry and plum aromas lead to rich, full flavors. It brings plenty of fruit-filled appeal, though the variety's wild side seems tamed."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,30.0,91.0,"Soft and finely perfumed, this is full-bodied Riesling, adding just a touch of sweetness to the pear and white currant fruit flavors. This is a great vintage of this wine, probably the best since 2002."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta di Ceppaiano,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of blue flowers, black-skinned berries, baking spice and Mediterranean herb take shape in the glass. A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, the approachable palate doles out black cherry, crushed plum, cinnamon and clove while dried mint provides backup. Silky tannins and fresh acidity balance the juicy flavors. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Campo di Sasso,30.0,91.0,"Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot go into this quintessential bottling from the Tuscan coast. It opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, baking spice, aromatic herb, violets and a whiff of wet soil. The delicious palate doles out crunchy red cherries, crushed raspberries, mint, anise and minerality alongside fresh acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Qaramy,30.0,91.0,"Calm, foresty, complex and inviting on the bouquet, with catchy berry and spice aromas. It's round, balanced and healthy in the mouth, with cola, dried herb, cassis and blackberry flavors. Chocolaty and oaky on the finish, but dry and proper. Almost identical to Qaramy's basic blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah. Drink now."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Numanthia,30.0,91.0,"An excellent wine for an off vintage, with licorice, balsam, black fruit galore and coconut aromas. The feel is plush, layered and smooth for Toro, with blackberry, mocha, lemon peel and coconutty flavors. Toasty on the finish, with a final wave of vanilla and chocolate. Drink now through 2014."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Gump Markus Prackwieser,30.0,91.0,"Showing finesse as well as surprising structure for such a wet, rainy vintage, this opens with heady aromas of tomato vine, hay, a note of bell pepper and a whiff of kiwi. The savory, linear palate delivers grapefruit, honeydew melon, a lightly toasted note and minerals brightened by firm acidity."
Ribolla Gialla,Italy,Northeastern Italy,La Tunella,30.0,91.0,"Enticing aromas recall white flower and a hint of stone fruit. The focused palate offers Bartlett pear, yellow apple and tangerine alongside subtle notes of dried aromatic herbs and crisp acidity. Fermentation in large casks lends this structure and complexity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Clément-Pichon,30.0,91.0,"Under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Emilion, this estate continues to make impressive wine. With its subtle tannins and ripe berry fruits, it is structured while never letting the tannins overwhelm the fruit. It is an impressive wine to age, so drink from 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion,30.0,91.0,"This is the second wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. It is rich with tannins and juicy with black-currant acidity. As befits a second wine, it is developing well and easily. Drink from 2021. While it shares the same name as Château Haut-Brion, there is no ownership or location connection between the two properties."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Dei,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of blue flower, plum, scorched earth and allspice come together in the glass. The soft, rich palate offers layers of black cherry, white pepper and savory herb alongside round tannins. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,US,California,Buck Shack,30.0,91.0,"This bold, densely flavored and impressively tannic wine is dry, very well structured and will be interesting to age until 2018–2019. It smells darkly fruity, smoky and spicy, and tastes like cranberry and black cherry, finishing with a firm tang of tannin. It will be best after 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Rendarrio Vineyards,30.0,91.0,"Light but juicy aromas of white grapes, sandalwood and cinnamon show on the nose of this bottling by Irvine-raised, Cal Poly-educated, Paso Robles-residing Ryan Render. There is a flinty touch to the palate, with rounded green pear, baked apple and nectarine fruit, though the savory sea-salt touch is what makes this wine shine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,High Valley Vineyard,30.0,91.0,"Touches of cedar and fresh-cut oak in the aroma join ripe but dry fruit flavors and firm tannins on the palate. Well structured for mid-term aging, this wine will be best after 2019."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,30.0,91.0,"This 100% varietal wine offers fairly locked up aromas of dried herb, red and black fruit, and barrel spice. The flavors are ripe and dark fruited, with a lovely sense of texture and presence that carries through the finish."
Grenache-Carignan,US,Washington,Syncline,30.0,91.0,"This wine—the only of its kind in the state—is a blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Grenache. It brings appealing, quite pure aromas of herbs, bramble and red fruit. The flavors also bring a compelling sense of purity, with no new oak influence anywhere in sight. Put it on the dinner table to see it shine."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley,30.0,91.0,"The toast character lends a firm structure to this solid, rich wine. A spice note pairs well with the white plum and apricot fruit, and there is a sense that this needs to age for several years in order to bring out its richness and full potential."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Gorman,30.0,91.0,"It's labeled simply Columbia Valley but in fact it's made from all Red Mountain fruit. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, with a splash of Petit Verdot, this is quite ripe and sweetly juicy—like a big bowl of blackberries. Aged in once-used French oak, it has picked up some char and graphite notes."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Tempus Cellars,30.0,91.0,"The blend includes old vine (1972 planting) Cabernet from Sagemoor, along with some Klipsun fruit and Seven Hills Merlot. This shows solid winemaking, excellent varietal character, and the structure to age gracefully. The tight cassis fruit is delineated with details of tarragon, rosemary and thyme."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Tercero,30.0,91.0,"This blend of 64% Roussanne, 24% Viognier and 12% Grenache Blanc from White Hawk, Camp 4 and Zaca Mesa vineyards begins with an oily nose of dried apricots, dried apples, smoke and intriguing pecan and macadamia nuttiness. The palate is crisp and more restrained, offering honey, pears, dried mango and a woody, white mushroom-like earthiness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Magnol,30.0,91.0,"This richly structured wine exudes the ripeness of the vintage. It has full tannins, dense black currant and berry flavors and a refreshing line of acidity. The tannins are still firm, needing some time to unwind. Drink from 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Nefarious,30.0,91.0,"Wonderful purity is on display in this mineral-driven, tart, racy and expressive Syrah from the estate vineyard. The bright and tangy berry flavors may strike some palates as a bit on the sour side, but there is more than enough ripeness here for most. This is succulent and classy."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Nefarious,30.0,91.0,"Made from three-quarters Merlot and one-eighth each Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre, this new version of The Spinner seems to be surfing a wave of spicy berry that's about to smash into a wall of chocolate. But it never crashes, instead it just sails on through a gorgeous midpalate into a lingering finish that features caramel and mocha highlights."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,30.0,91.0,"The Riesling perfumes shine, and its light, almost dancing character is blended with a more complex set of yellow fruits and mineral texture. The result is a serious wine that demands to be aged for at least four years. Screwcap."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Dutschke,30.0,91.0,"Hews closely to the Dutschke style: Full and soft, with slightly jammy dark cherry-berry notes accented by cedar and Mexican chocolate. This is a velvety, immediately accessible Shiraz for relatively early drinking, delivered at a remarkably fair price."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Tulpen,30.0,91.0,"This is 70% Cabernet, 20% Merlot. Dark, tight and loaded with fruits, this balanced, juicy wine has it all—elegance, length, finesse and mouth appeal. Blackberry and black cherry fruits dominate, with light suggestions of pretty leaf, tobacco, earth and some iron."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine l'Ancienne Cure,30.0,91.0,"This is the lighter of two sweet wines from Ancienne Cure, but this is still pretty intense. It has great sweet marmalade and orange zest flavors, as much sweet as botrytized. Soft, round and opulent."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tertulia,30.0,91.0,"A real success, this intensely spicy Syrah loads in mouth-softening flavors of buttermilk, cocoa and cinnamon. Lots of toast and coffee, with a creamy, textural mouthfeel. The rich, ripe, almost sweet cherry fruit is like a mouthful of fresh pie."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château du Cèdre,30.0,91.0,"With a little extra bottle age, this wine shows great charm and style. The dense fruits are finely restrained, but have all the solidity of a juicy Malbec, spiced with the driest tannin and a core of powerful minerality. For further aging, 3–4 years."
Pinot Noir,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Kingston Family,30.0,91.0,"Kingston's top-level Pinot Noir has been a consistent scorer for the past three vintages. The 2008 starts with pure raspberry and cherry aromas as well as tea accents, while the textbook palate has a proper feel and tasty raspberry and cherry flavors. Spice notes and integrated oak help it achieve its status as one of Chile's truest, most recognizable Pinot Noirs. Drink now through 2011; 300 cases made."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Carabella,30.0,91.0,"Careful winemaking balances the fruit and oak perfectly in this lovely, medium-weight wine. It's polished and steely, with just-ripe apple and pear fruit, braced with racy, lemony acidity and a streak of minerality. It was fermented in 100% French oak, one sixth new."
Zinfandel,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,30.0,91.0,"Zinfandel from old vines is rarely this light and refreshing, yet still exuberant in fruit. A mix of tart cherry and just-ripe blackberry comes with a lingering edge of citrus around the cinnamon and black pepper spice. Funky earth ripples through the middle, before a subtle take on leather finishes things out."
Chardonnay,US,California,Jordan,30.0,91.0,"Tightly structured and quiet in oak, this wine instead exudes bright notes of lemon peel and orange blossom, offering plenty of well-traced minerality on the palate. It finishes lean and crisp, refreshing enough to enjoy all night long."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Hahn,30.0,91.0,"This widely available and well-priced appellation blend shows dark aromas of black raspberry, elderberry, wet slate and crushed gravel on the nose. The wine makes a soft entry on the palate, where mulberry meets with Earl Grey tea and a pinch of anise."
Zinfandel,US,California,Saldo,30.0,91.0,"Saldo comes from the folks who brought you The Prisoner. Admirable ripeness and lushness carry this full-bodied, dark-colored and densely fruity wine from a smoky aroma through jammy dark-fruit flavors to a lingering finish that has a drop of baking-spice sweetness."
Malbec,US,Oregon,Abacela,30.0,91.0,"Impenetrably dark in color, this potent wine marries black fruit to ample barrel accents of smoke and char. Though aged in just 5% new French oak, those dark scents and flavors permeate the wine. It's a style with broad appeal."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Blakeslee,30.0,91.0,"One of the top Pinot rosés of the vintage, this is beautiful to look at, to sniff and to sip. The color of pale pink cherry blossoms, it matches rather delicate complexity to surprising concentration, pushing ripe cherry fruit front and center. It's finished dry, and should not be over-chilled, or you'll miss the lovely aromatics."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quanta Terra,30.0,91.0,"This is a seriously wood-aged wine, sumptuous in its smooth and creamy texture. It has citrus, lime and really fresh acidity to balance the toast and rich fruitiness. Elegant and worth aging further. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Plaisance Ranch,30.0,91.0,"Bold and smoky, this offers tart, tight cherry and brambly berry fruit. The juicy acidity is counterpointed with a certain chalkiness. A whiff of truffle further complements the fruit. It's a sleek wine with surprising power."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Artadi,30.0,91.0,"Tight and edgy but ultimately oaky and generous on the nose, with earth, vanilla, dried cheese and blackberry notes. Feels cushioned and complete, with depth of feel and flavor; tastes of deep berry, mild herbs and finally a toasty wave of coffee and chocolate takes over. Impressive for a 2008; drink now through 2014."
Chardonnay,US,California,Jordan,30.0,91.0,"The winery is making new strides by finding the best sites for its wines rather than trying to grow everything on its estate. This Chardonnay is a case in point. High in acidity and low in oak influence, it offers restrained layers of tropical mango, lemon and ginger snap."
Braucol,France,Southwest France,Domaine du Moulin,30.0,91.0,"Braucol, hardly found outside Gaillac, produces a deep, dark-colored wine. This powerful wine is rich, smooth and still very young. It is packed to the limits with dark tannins and flavors of its wood aging. Drink from 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Forgeron,30.0,91.0,"Beautifully aromatic, this weaves exotic scents of coffee, smoke, black cherry, cassis, moist earth, lead pencil, and toffee into a lush tapestry. Smooth, fruity, flavorful, soft and balanced, it finishes with lightly grainy tannins that are as supple as leather."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Branas Grand Poujeaux,30.0,91.0,"The wine has weight, tannins and a firm structure. At the same time, its ripe black fruits are developing to fill out the structure and give an impressive wine. Hints of dark chocolate go with the juicy acidity to leave a wine that has several years to develop. Drink from 2021."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,30.0,91.0,"Not many Douro whites get the heavy bottle treatment like this fine wood-aged wine. It is a half-and-half blend of Gouveio and Viosinho, ripe and with layers of toast and intense yellow fruits as well as citrus acidity. It is just ready to drink although it will be better from 2017."
Malbec,Argentina,Other,Colomé,30.0,91.0,"This starts out massive and grapy, but with each passing minute it becomes more Salta, and hence more complex. Feral, leathery, roasted-berry aromas require patience. In the mouth, this is tannic and muscular, with herbal, spicy, dry flavors of blackberry and stewed plum. Raging acidity and firm tannins suggest that this needs at least until 2016 to settle."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Gorman,30.0,91.0,"Always a fine value in the Gorman lineup, this new Zachary's Ladder is the best yet. It's half Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah, and 10% Petit Verdot, yielding a plush, mouthfilling wine that remains light on its feet. Credit the lively acidity that elevates mixed red berry fruits and finishes with a kiss of milk chocolate."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Tranche,30.0,91.0,"Impressive in its size and weight, this wine has tart fruit flavors of pomegranate and blueberry, with a dusting of coffee grounds. Tannins are ripe, firm and sleek, and the structure impactful. This needs even more bottle age or some hours of aeration."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Michel Redde et Fils,30.0,91.0,"Full-bodied, with a rich character that adds to the fruitiness, this still needs to mature. Bright apples and citrus are caught up in a strongly mineral texture that gives a steely character. Wait until 2015."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Laurenz V.,30.0,91.0,"Full and rich wine, its acidity brightening peach, melon and spice flavors. It is an expressive wine characterized by its ripe fruits, intense pepper and ginger. Screwcap."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Chiarito,30.0,91.0,"Juicy as a dark plum with a raspberry chaser, this 80-case Petite Sirah gets better and better as it opens, revealing itself to be mellow and rustic, yet big and broad-shouldered. It would make the perfect pairing with a plate of cheesy pasta, meat sauce and crusty garlic bread, or anything with pancetta."
Syrah,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Rudi Schultz,30.0,91.0,"Soft foliage notes lead on the nose of this wine, with supporting aromas of strawberry, raspberry and stewed rhubarb. The medium-weight mouth offers moderate tannins and a good streak of lifting acidity, resulting in a texture like crushed satin. Fruit-skin flavors linger on the medium-length close alongside accents of pepper and sweet spice."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Fontodi,30.0,91.0,"Made from organic grapes, this succulent wine delivers balsamic aromas and juicy black cherry flavors layered with cinnamon and white pepper. It's radiant and structured, with big round tannins and edgy acidity. Drink 2015–2025."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,D'Angelo,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of mature plum, French oak and tilled earth mingle with vanilla and an earthy whiff of game. The scents carry over to the chewy palate along with ripe black cherry, prune, new leather and black pepper. Assertive fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity show the wine's Aglianico pedigree. Drink 2019–2025."
Syrah,US,California,Bernat,30.0,91.0,"From a small vineyard in Los Olivos, this wine offers boysenberry, lavender, rosemary and a touch of oak on the nose. Intriguing pine tar, bay leaf and eucalyptus resin show on the palate, which gives depth to the deep black fruit."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Fonterutoli,30.0,91.0,"Underbrush, grilled herb, roasted coffee bean and dark-skinned berry aromas unfold in the glass. The elegantly structured palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, sage, anise and clove framed in bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade dos Grous,30.0,91.0,"Very rich, ripe wine, full and round in character. It has spice from wood aging as well as almost-sweet yellow fruits. Pineapple acidity does give some balance to this powerful white wine."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,30.0,91.0,"This wine is atypically fine and chiseled for this estate, combining bright, sweet fruity notes of lime and green apples with crushed stone and spring flowers. It's light in body, but impeccably balanced."
Merlot,US,Washington,Goose Ridge,30.0,91.0,"This estate-grown Merlot is a standout among the Goose Ridge reds produced in 2010. A firm and substantial mix of red and black fruits comes on a bed of juicy acidity. Medium-bodied, it extends gracefully through the finish with hints of chocolate-covered raisins."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Numanthia,30.0,91.0,"Dark and opaque, with compact aromas of rubbery blackberry and controlled oak. Feels flush and grabby, with staunch tannins and creamy, toasty flavors accenting core blackberry and cassis. This seems more barrel-influenced the longer it airs out. A generous wine to drink now through 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Maryhill,30.0,91.0,"The reserve takes the tight focus and black fruit flavors of the regular Cab and ramps them up a notch or two. Deeper, denser and darker, with flavors of cassis and licorice wrapped into the tannic, earthy depths of the finish. This has great power."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Ramón Bilbao,30.0,91.0,"Hickory is the lead aroma, followed by notes of leather, earthy berry and spice. It feels juicy, lively and traditional, with a fine body-to-acid ratio. This offers classic Rioja flavors of red fruit, tomato, tobacco, dill and vanilla, with a long, consistent finish. It's healthy and drinkable now through 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Wente,30.0,91.0,"This bold and full-bodied wine has vivid smoke and spice aromas, with rich blackberry and espresso flavors. A healthy wrapping of tannins add an appetizing bite and a lingering, lightly spicy finish. Overall, the tasty oak nuances are well blended with the ripe fruit."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Breathless,30.0,91.0,"This spicy and well-balanced wine has a light salmon color, subtle aromas like cinnamon and cherries, and flavor accents resembling cranberries, paprika and ginger. It's light to medium bodied, has very fine bubbles and a lingering finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,Saviah,30.0,91.0,"Once again, the amazing Stillwater Creek vineyard comes through with a highly expressive, pure and intense Syrah that captures the heart and soul of a Washington State take on the grape. The sharp flavors of berries and spice mingle proportionately; the tannins are chiseled and the acids just right."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Dopff Au Moulin,30.0,91.0,"A touch of vanilla can be discerned in the sweet peachy juiciness of this wine which is already apparent on the nose. The palate is fluid, almost plump and rich with these flavors, especially peach and rose, come to the fore. A pleasantly bitter phenolic edge saves this from becoming too rich. Alcoholic warmth is apparent on the rich sweet finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Terre Rouge,30.0,91.0,"A slightly tawny color and extra spicy, meaty aromas make this appetizing blend of 75% Grenache, 17% Mourvèdre and 8% Syrah interesting to taste. It's medium-bodied, peppery and savory and is backed by moderate berry flavors."
Red Blend,South Africa,Coastal Region,Bellingham,30.0,91.0,"This blend of 64% Malbec, 21% Merlot and 15% Mourvèdre is forward in ripe red cherry and plum as well as strawberry-rhubarb pie. Notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla bean weave throughout the nose and palate, spicing up the fruity core and lingering on the close. It's smooth and plush, with a crushed-satin texture and excellent overall balance and harmony."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,30.0,91.0,"This 100% varietal from one of the state's oldest vineyards brims with aromas of dark roasted coffee, char, bittersweet chocolate and black cherry. Flavors show plenty of concentration and depth with a lingering, cocoa and vanilla-filled finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Vieux Cardinal Lafaurie,30.0,91.0,"This is a full-bodied wine, perfumed by its 25% Cabernet Franc and given a juicy fruitcake character by the smooth Merlot. It does still retain a crisper juicy acidity that will develop well as it ages over the next few months. Drink from late 2017."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Maquis,30.0,91.0,"Black-plum and apple-skin aromas are fruity and a bit raw. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Carmenère and Petit Verdot is full, properly tannic and loamy in feel. Dark-leaning flavors of licorice, peppery spice, chocolate and herbs finish with classic Chilean notes of black olive and tobacco. Drink through 2019."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,Paternoster,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of espresso, spiced plum and whiffs of oak-driven spice take center stage on this structured red. The firm elegant palate doles out black cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon and licorice set against assertive fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018–2028."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Two Vintners,30.0,91.0,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (83%), with the balance smidgens of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The aromas bring notes of barrel spice, vanilla, herb, cherry and red and black fruit. The flavors are full and bold, with burly but not unyielding tannins giving support. Put it up against a juicy steak or give it some time in the cellar."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Paro,30.0,91.0,"Dense in packed earth and forest floor, this well-integrated and silky wine bursts in black cherry, blueberry pie and cardamom. With a beautiful flower on the label, it conjures floral orange blossom from the bottle, speaking elegance to power."
Merlot,US,New York,Shaw,30.0,91.0,"Four years of aging on the lees gives this particularly late-release Merlot a delightfully tactile mouthfeel. It's silky to the touch, yet voluminous on the palate, filling the mouth with flavors of ripe red cherry and cranberry accented by bramble, earth and potpourri. Sprightly in acidity yet rich in body, it lingers with intensity and persistence."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine de Valdition,30.0,91.0,"From organic grapes in a blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is rich and ripe. Generous red fruits are cut with light acidity and broadened by the smooth, creamy texture. The fruit lasts right through to the end."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,OS Winery,30.0,91.0,"This excellent red is 75% Cabernet Franc, blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. O•S generally produces one of the best Francs in Washington, lifted and intense, occasionally a bit high-toned, but always packed with juicy red fruits and barrel highlights of coffee and tobacco."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Laporte,30.0,91.0,"Still in its first flush of youth, it shows great minerality as well as intense citrus and apple fruit flavors. A light touch of ripeness brings out a more yellow fruit character. Drink now, but better to keep until 2015."
Malbec,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,30.0,91.0,"This 100% varietal wine brings brooding aromas of black licorice, anise, dark plum and herb followed by rich, focused black plum flavors. It delivers a lot of charm and hedonistic appeal."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Collin-Bourisset,30.0,91.0,"With its crisp texture, this wine is bright and fruity, with good acidity and a complex background of spice, vanilla and yellow fruits. The wine is deliciously balanced and ready to drink."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,30.0,91.0,"A rounded earthiness reminiscent of Bosc pear envelops this fluid, balanced and fruit-driven wine. It conveys effortless harmony with a creamy touch that's clear and beautiful. The light approach is admirable, the clean, apple-scented finish very satisfying."
Chardonnay,US,California,Joullian,30.0,91.0,"The aromas from this Dijon clone-planted vineyard start with sweet ripe peach until a touch of flint and sage emerge. The plush, creamy palate leans toward tropicality, also with peach and lime, plus a slight mustard bitterness."
Red Blend,US,California,Brave & Maiden,30.0,91.0,"Quite deep and brooding on the nose, this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Merlot shows mocha, blood, blueberry, smoke, loam and gingerbread on the nose. The showy, ripe purple fruit is restrained by a lava-rock minerality, oregano herbals and cedar tannins that give a grippy texture."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Ramos-Pinto,30.0,91.0,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2015, this brand was the among the first Douro still wines. This Reserva, with its wood-aged flavors, is rich and full of ripe white fruits while not losing sight of the mineral texture of white wines from the region. While it is drinkable now, it will be much better from 2018."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,El Enemigo,30.0,91.0,"Stout bold berry aromas come with a hint of bacon. This feels condensed, with rubbery, pinchy tannins. Flavors of plum and wild berry are tightly wound, while this is long and loud on the finish, with a recurrence of abrasive tannins. Drink through 2020."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Two Vintners,30.0,91.0,"This is Zinfandel at its unabashed best, bringing aromas of vanilla, spice, raspberry and cranberry. The palate holds nothing back—full bodied and rich. It's a heavy hitter but keeps its balance remarkably well."
Grüner Veltliner,US,Oregon,Minimus,30.0,91.0,"The deep, almost tawny gold color, coupled with a slight pétillance, signals that this is no ordinary GV. It went through four days of whole cluster maceration before being fermented with wild yeasts in new 500-liter Austrian oak puncheons. It's rich, toasty and lively in the mouth, yet smoothed out with the oxidative impact of the time in wood. A generous and flavorful wine, it shows toast and nuts and caramelized highlights along with light apple-butter fruit."
Petit Verdot,US,California,Santa Barbara Winery,30.0,91.0,"Bruce McGuire makes a strong case for the potential of Petit Verdot—a variety not often bottled on its own—in the Santa Ynez Valley. Baked blackberry, licorice and cocoa scents show on the playful nose, while black cherry, cocoa dust, cardamom and anise flavors light up the palate."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,30.0,91.0,"Saint Clair's Pioneer Block wines are always worth trying for their expressions of Marlborough's subregional characters. This one, from deep clay soils at the foot of the Dry Hills, features a bold cherry aroma and flavor, backed by ample vanilla and baking spice notes. It's big and slightly chunky in style, but it seems likely to smooth out over the next 12 months as the dusty tannins subside."
Malbec,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,30.0,91.0,"This wine boasts a riot of tart huckleberry, marionberry and purple fruit flavors that taste as if they have been lightly soaked in Bourbon. The dusty tannins set up a long ride onto the palate-pleasing finish."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,30.0,91.0,"One of the top offerings from Saint Clair is invariably its Omaka Reserve. The 2010 features blackberry and cola notes that are accented by a hickory smoke tone, a harmonious and supple texture and a moderately long finish. Ready to drink now, the wine should easily last another few years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Seven Hills,30.0,91.0,"The aromas of cedar, fresh dark berries, thyme, garden herbs and flowers provide instant appeal, with woodsy accents following. Lively plum and raspberry flavors back them up, with fine-grained tannins and barrel accents speckled throughout."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,30.0,91.0,"Beautifully ripe and aromatic notions of juicy pear and red apples play on the nose. The palate is more advanced and full of lanolin and chalk notes with a rich texture but absolutely dry. This has a rich but taut, almost balm-like body with concentration. The backbone of lemony freshness pull a tight focus. Ready now, but will develop and drink well until 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Alder Ridge,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of dried herb, cherry cola and barrel spice are out in front on this 100% varietal wine. The cherry and blackberry flavors are sweet and plump, showing concentration and depth along with dry, grippy tannins."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Waipara,Pegasus Bay,30.0,91.0,"Full of butter notes, along with toasted oatmeal and Brazil nuts, this rich, oily Chard is all about New World power, yet allied to an Old World sense of balance. Honey and tropical-fruit flavors play out on the palate; toast and tangerines extend through the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,La Crema,30.0,91.0,"This lush offering opens with appealing aromas of rose petals and fresh strawberries, then glides into a smooth-as-silk midpalate. The berry/cherry fruit is nicely adorned with toasty barrel flavors, and it's as satiny as new sheets. You'll find it hard to keep from gulping this by the glassful."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sineann,30.0,91.0,"Wonderfully aromatic and packed with flavor, this outstanding value opens lightly spicy with zingy raspberry fruit. It's like a tart jam, with citrus-peel highlights peeking through in the sappy finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Baston-Brillette,30.0,91.0,"With its firmly tannic core, this is a rich and structured wine. It has a dense, fruit-driven texture, full of very fresh black plum and berry flavors. The tannins provide a dry counterpoint. It's a wine that will age; drink from 2018."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Stevens,30.0,91.0,"The fruit is half Sheridan and half Dineen vineyard. Although stylistically a brother to the Stevens Merlot, this has the varietal earmarks of Cabernet Franc – some green, leafy streaks, more spice and sharpness to the tannins, and a definite herbal component. The fruit is an equal but not dominant partner – blackberry, cassis, and black olive, finished with a whiff of very dark chocolate."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château des Jacques,30.0,91.0,"Light in color, but rich in fruit, this wine has structure, spice and ripe red cherry fruits that are kept from total exuberance by the layer of young tannin. The wine should age; drink from 2016."
Trebbiano,Italy,Veneto,Suavia,30.0,91.0,"Made entirely with Trebbiano di Soave, this vibrant white offers enticing aromas of white flower and citrus blossom. The linear palate delivers juicy yellow peach, pear, kiwi and mineral alongside firm acidity."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,Suavia,30.0,91.0,"Delicate aromas suggest stone fruit, flint and Mediterranean herb. The luminous palate delivers white peach, Bartlett pear, crisp apple, almond and an energizing mineral vein."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Panzanello,30.0,91.0,"Firm and fragrant, this opens with scents of violet, iris, ripe plum and sweet baking spice. The chewy palate delivers dried plum, ripe black cherry, white pepper, anise and clove while fine-grained, polished tannins provide support."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Adamant Cellars,30.0,91.0,Lovely concentration and texture make this a standout and the best wine yet from newcomer Adamant Cellars. Berries and cassis fruit flavors are crisply defined and annotated with smoke and earth; the wine has grip and length.
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Hall,30.0,91.0,"With a handful of Viognier blended in, and nine months spent in new French oak, this wine offers deep layers of melon and peach surrounded by a wall of floral aromatics. Delicious and ripe, the wine holds enough structure to hold well for another couple of years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Cantenac Brown,30.0,91.0,"A hugely concentrated wine showing chewy, but ripe tannins. Smooth, polished fruit combines with well-balanced wood and suppressed power. This is certainly a wine that will develop well, making it drinkable in five years and mature in 10-15 years."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Viñamada,30.0,91.0,"More traditional than modern in style, this has aromas of citrus, herb, dry oak and medium-weight fruit. It feels crisp and tightly focused, with a complex palate that offers notes of berries, chocolate and herbs. It finishes long, with a leathery, meaty element that lends gravitas to the wine. Drink now–2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Bunchgrass,30.0,91.0,"A blend of Cabernet Franc (60%) and Merlot, this wine offers high-toned aromas of dried herbs, milk chocolate and cherry, along with an undertone of green pepper. The chocolate and cherry flavors are silky and linger long after the last sip."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Bunchgrass,30.0,91.0,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Cabernet Franc (30%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of coffee, dried herbs, green pepper and smoke are followed by creamy-feeling cherry and café au lait flavors. It brings a whole lot of appeal."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Bel-Air Ortet,30.0,91.0,"Still firm with tannins, this is also a rich, generous wine. It has mint aromas that follow through on to the palate with wood-aging flavors. Bold blackberry fruit and juicy acidity balance the structure and give the wine a ripe character. The wine will be ready to drink from 2018."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Capafons-Ossó,30.0,91.0,"Reedy, attractive, classy aromas of red fruits, tobacco and fine herbs are like a red carpet entering the gala. The mouth is structured and tannic but not hard or biting; flavors of red berry, plum and cherry lean towards sweet, while the finish is long, medicinal and on the money. Drink now through 2014."
Port,Portugal,Port,Sandeman,30.0,91.0,"The wine is firm and dry, with concentrated tannins that are still masking the fruit. There is considerable structure here, along with acidity and a fresh layer of black currant. This is a wine that needs aging, drink from 2019."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,30.0,91.0,"Hailing from the oldest vines on the Castello Nipozzano estate, this offers enticing aromas of fragrant violet, iris, perfumed berry, aromatic herb and baking spice. Made with Sangiovese and small percentages of Malvasia Nera, Colorino and Canaiolo, the silky, linear palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and a hint of licorice framed in smooth tannins and fresh acidity."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejo,Cartuxa,30.0,91.0,This is a rich wine that feels full-bodied and with concentration. It has ripe pineapple and tropical fruit flavors as well as fresher citrus acidity. It has also a fine texture that gives the wine great depth and ripeness. Drink from late 2016.
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alta Vista,30.0,91.0,"Ripe grapy aromas are more chunky than mammoth. Saturated and muscular on the palate, this tastes of roasted salty blackberry, while the finish is full and meaty in both flavor and texture. Drink this stout full-bodied Malbec through 2022."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Companhia das Quintas,30.0,91.0,"Densely tannic, this is also full of sweet berry fruits. Powerful and superripe, its fruit is beginning to integrate into the big, smoky, chocolaty structure. The finish shows both toast and juicy fruit notes. Keep for 3–4 years."
Barbera,US,California,Borjón,30.0,91.0,"This smooth blockbuster is powered by saturated ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, with a rich, opulent body. The layered fruit, cinnamon and nutmeg notes are fascinating, and the texture is lush and inviting."
Syrah,US,Oregon,Abacela,30.0,91.0,"This blend of Umpqua and Applegate Valley fruit, cofermented with 2% Viognier, is crisp and varietal, with mixed berries, peppercorns and cured meats all vying for your attention. Seamless and balanced, it keeps the alcohol down around 14.3%, which keeps the integrated structure intact. Silky tannins carry a whiff of roasted coffee through the finish."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann,30.0,91.0,"A notion of apple peel clings to the aromas of peach and mirabelle that swirl on nose and palate. The medium-sweet body has a lightness and ease about it, but also a very earthy grounding edge. The richness is countered by some lemon freshness and a phenolic element. The finish is warm and intense."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Lusco,30.0,91.0,"Light, airy and leesy on the nose, this is more complex than most everyday Albariños. Additional aromas of vanilla wafer, acacia, honeydew and minerals lead to a clean-flowing palate. Minerally peach and nectarine flavors show a touch of almond-skin bitterness on the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Kitá,30.0,91.0,"Chumash tribe descendent and Fresno State-trained winemaker Tara Gomez uses her extensive experience to make a solid lineup of wines. This one holds dense aromas of boysenberry extract, Dr Pepper, toast, condensed cedar and beef char. Elderberry is the dominant fruit flavor, showing both woodiness and dark purple fruit."
Pinot Blanc,US,California,Ron Rubin,30.0,91.0,"The first vintage of this variety for this producer, this lovely white comes from a rare and renowned site in Green Valley. An austere nose of lemony green apple and honey follows through on the crisp, light-bodied palate. Floral in apple blossom, it reveals a touch of wet stone on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Sonoma-Cutrer,30.0,91.0,"A bright, lovely layering of cherry and strawberry strikes first, before a jolt of rose perfume finds its complement in an earthy lilt of salt and forest. Sandalwood enhances the intrigue and complexity of this medium-bodied wine."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Clif Family,30.0,91.0,"This extroverted dry wine has big rose-petal and honeysuckle aromas. Powerful floral and grapefruit flavors flood the palate and linger long on the finish. It's full bodied and very concentrated, with a mouthfilling viscosity that leaves a lasting impression."

Zinfandel,US,California,Terra d'Oro,30.0,91.0,"Very soothing to sip, this is nevertheless a full-bodied wine with generous cherry, raspberry and almost-meaty flavors that flood the palate and spread to the edges of the mouth. The texture is broad and expansive, with only mild tannins."
Chardonnay,US,California,Parducci,30.0,91.0,Enticing aromas like baking spices and a vivid mix of fruit and spice flavors are carried along beautifully by lively acidity matched with luxurious body. This tastes subtly and attractively oaky and has considerable complexity and length.
Petit Verdot,US,Washington,Thurston Wolfe,30.0,91.0,"Nano-produced, this wine offers aromas of herbs, crushed violets and coffee. Cherry flavors coat the palate with a full feel while displaying expertly integrated tannins. The finish lingers."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Kudos,30.0,91.0,"Yummy, with ripe, plush berries running rampant across the tongue. The juicy acids and underlying minerality add lift and life, but the fruit, rolling from cranberry to boysenberry to blackberry, just won't let go. The structure suggests ageability for another decade of more."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,:Nota Bene,30.0,91.0,"Aged for 22 months in French oak—one third new—this is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot. Nota Bene's wines are not shy about high alcohol, but here the fruit stands up well to the oak treatment and shows no sign of over-ripeness. A good spine supports a rich wine with black fruits, balanced acids, and a big streak of espresso."
Pinot Nero,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Cesarini Sforza,30.0,91.0,"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this opens with delicate aromas of woodland berry, apple, Alpine herb and a whiff of bread crust. The creamy palate offers cherry, strawberry, candied nectarine zest and a note of baking spice alongside a soft, persistent perlage."

It's a wine still in development, bursting with young black-currant and black-plum fruits as well as acidity. The wood is a strong background presence and will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Aiguilhe,30.0,91.0,"Stephan von Neipperg of Château Canon la Gaffelière was an early proponent of Castillon vineyard potential and chose this property which is on the same ridge as Saint-Emilion. Fruity and ripe, this is a generous wine. Finely structured tannins back up the black-currant fruits and give the wine a texture that bodes well for the future. Drink from 2019."
Red Blend,US,California,Trinitas,30.0,91.0,"Sunny berry aromas give way to focused black cherry and dark-chocolate flavors that ride a richly tannic texture in this full-bodied wine. Made from a blend based on Zinfandel and Carignane grapes, it delivers ample complexity and depth."

Greco,Italy,Southern Italy,Villa Raiano,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and crushed stone slowly take shape on this elegant white. On the vibrant, linear palate, a mineral vein and a smoky note add depth to crisp green apple, peach and tangerine. Racy acidity leads to a crisp, clean finish. Hold a few years to let this fully develop. Drink 2028–2024."
Romorantin,France,Loire Valley,Benoît Daridan,30.0,91.0,"The Romorantin is a local grape found mainly in the Cheverny area of the central Loire.

Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Hogue,30.0,91.0,"If a whiff of volatility doesn't turn you off, this tightly layered reserve from Hogue has a lot going for it. Gobs of cherry and cassis fruit, dense and deep, roll into veins of earth, olive and graphite. A big wine with plenty of life ahead."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Fess Parker,30.0,91.0,"There's a wild array of aromas to this appellation blend, including wild mint and huckleberries.

Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Mayor,30.0,91.0,"Meaty, rubbery aromas of berry fruits come with hints of minty green and lemony oak. This feels wide and tannic on the palate, with ripe, oaky flavors of berry, cassis, vanilla and licorice. A creamy palate is healthy and completes the wine in fine fashion; drink through 2020."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Mayor,30.0,91.0,"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are pure and lusty. In the mouth, it shows chewy tannins, a stout structure and generous flavors of blackberry, chocolate, pepper and a spot of salty brine. A toasty, dark, heady finish confirms the overall quality. Drink through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Seven Hills,30.0,91.0,"The Cabernet is stiffened up with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Cab Franc and Malbec, resulting in a firm, herbal, but very well-balanced Bordeaux-style blend. There's compact cassis fruit, streaked with light stem, earth and herb. This is a wine that should improve with bottle age through 2019."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Caliterra,30.0,91.0,"Concentrated berry and cassis aromas are lush yet spicy, and come with notes of olive and tobacco. The palate on this blend of Carmenère and Malbec is a touch narrow in feel, but it's not at all thin. Flavors of ripe cherry and cassis reflect a hot vintage, while a mellow finish of medicinal berry flavors confirms the wine's ripe character. Drink through 2018."
Arneis,Italy,Piedmont,Negro Angelo e Figli,30.0,91.0,"This fragrant, elegant white opens with scents of orange blossom and white wild flower. The savory palate has a lovely depth of flavors, including yellow peach, Bosc pear, juicy lime and mineral alongside fresh acidity. A hazelnut note backs up the finish. It's an outstanding effort, especially given the difficult vintage."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,La Monacesca,30.0,91.0,"With a little time in the glass, this eventually reveals subtle aromas of toasted almond, pressed yellow flower, beeswax and a whiff of honey. The honeyed note follows over to the enveloping palate, along with candied citrus peel, marzipan and mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors and provides balance. It's already enjoyable but hold for more complexity. Drink through 2023."
Chardonnay,US,California,Truchard,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of tropical pineapple, guava and mango as well as caramelized banana begin what seems will become a decadent journey on the palate, but no. The flavors and textures are measured and nicely balanced, with lilts of minerality rising on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Steele,30.0,91.0,"From a great vineyard site, this wine does justice to its mountain fruit and coastal acidity, capturing both with ease. Juicy pear, apple, pineapple and a gritty minerality surround big shoulders of body and weight, as aromas of flowers puncture the fruit."
Chenin Blanc,New Zealand,Gisborne,Millton,30.0,91.0,"This biodynamic wine is a study in contrasts. Non-fruit aromas of wax, paraffin and lanolin are offset by bright pineapple flavors, while a long, zesty finish balances the wine's ample weight and slightly creamy texture. Delicious now, it should drink well through at least 2022."
Malbec-Petit Verdot,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Famiglia Meschini,30.0,91.0,"Raisiny berry, spice cake and molasses aromas are rich and heady. This nonvintage blend of Malbec and Petit Verdot is a bit thick and oaky on the palate. Flavors of blackberry and creamy oak finish ripe and rooty, with a reprise of raisin."
Tannat,US,Oregon,Abacela,30.0,91.0,"This deep, grippy wine has the bones of a mastodon. Its thick blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit carries even darker streaks of chocolate and espresso. Though still rare, Tannat is making a home for itself in Southern Oregon. It's a meaty, steak-friendly alternative to pricier Cabernets."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Ysios,30.0,91.0,"Arguably the best Ysios reserva to date; it shows a full, lightly baked bouquet with berry aromas, spice, barrel char and herbs. Feels fresh and lush, with balance and tasty flavors of black fruit, fig, tobacco and chocolaty oak. It's a touch oaky and warm on the finish, but elegant and very well made. Drink now through 2015."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Chasselay,30.0,91.0,"A splendidly rich wine, with mint from new wood adding an extra dimension to the ripe cherry fruit and sweet tannins. It's a wine that shows the full assets of the fine 2009 vintage, spice and ripeness."
Baga,Portugal,Bairrada,Messias,30.0,91.0,"With a few years of age and three years in wood, this wine has become rich, full of concentration and delicious. It has weight and opulent black fruits to go with its fresh acidity. It's an elegant, smoothly textured wine, finishing with some dry tannins. Drink now."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,TintoNegro,30.0,91.0,"El Limo (silt) is solid on the nose, with blackberry, licorice and vanilla aromas. This is fresh on the surface but more layered below deck, with a crisp, healthy mouthfeel backed by berry, plum, raspberry and peppery chocolate flavors. On the finish, this is oaky and round, with some heat and burn at the tail end. Drink through 2021."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Jean-Paul Paquet,30.0,91.0,"Caramel aromas lead to a wine that is rich and full bodied. It has weight and concentration, along with fresh acidity that cuts through at the end. A good sense of minerality gives this wine extra texture. Drink from 2017."
Bovale,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Pala,30.0,91.0,"Made with old vines, this soulful red opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, game, baked earth, wild herb and a smoky note. The ripe, round palate doles out ripe black plum, black cherry, grilled rosemary and wild fennel alongside solid, velvety tannins. Concentrated and accessible, it will offer several more years of sheer drinking pleasure. Drink through 2021."
Chardonnay,US,California,Alma Rosa,30.0,91.0,"Restrained on the nose, this bottling by Richard Sanford and Nick de Luca shows light aromas of Marcona almond, lemon zest, Asian pear and Gravenstein apple. The sip is delicate in texture yet grippy with tannic structure, revealing pear flesh and squeezed lime flavors."
Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Spain,Northern Spain,Balbas,30.0,91.0,"This black-colored crianza delivers big, toasty aromas of charred oak, setting the stage for a massive palate, the equivalent of an 18-wheeler. Blackened flavors of burnt wood, coffee and berry fruit lead to a smacking tannic finish. Drink 2020–2025."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Tranche,30.0,91.0,"This is tight when first opened, with a hard-edged herbal character. Beneath that shell are richer, tropical fruit flavors of ripe banana, yellow apple and a hint of papaya; and with plenty of breathing time the wine softens and opens out. Roughly two thirds of the barrels were new French oak; and that is still being resolved into the fruit. This wine has a good 6–8 years of life ahead of it, but if you are drinking it now, decant it."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,Paul Anheuser,30.0,91.0,"Dusty mineral and saffron notes persist throughout this complex auslese. Preserved peach, lemon and dried apple tones are richly concentrated on the palate, but there's an unusually dark, steely elegance that persists through the finish."
Pinot Nero,Italy,Italy Other,Falesco,30.0,91.0,"Made with Pinot Noir, this elegant sparkler starts with a delicate fragrance of rose petal and red berry. The vibrant palate delivers creamy wild cherry, crunchy strawberry, spice and a note of freshly baked vanilla cookies backed up by crisp, refreshing acidity. The soft mousse carries through to the almond finish."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Citari,30.0,91.0,"Creamy and fresh, this sparkling Lugana shows real class, starting with its floral aromas of lemon blossom and stone fruit. The crisp palate delivers green apple, peach and yeasty bread crust alongside a refined perlage and bright acidity."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sineann,30.0,91.0,"Forward and already packed with subtle details, this bursts forth with red plum and cherry fruit, backed with juicy acidity. The acids carry a bit of orange flavor into a balanced, extended finish with a lick of milk chocolate. Delicious now and crafted for enjoyment through 2020 or more."
Chardonnay,Australia,Australia Other,Littore,30.0,91.0,"From 40-year-old vines in the Geelong GI, this is a huge step up in quality from the winery's Jindalee label. Nutty aromas of toasted cereal grain and grilled peaches set the table for this full-bodied, lushly textured Chardonnay. It's rich and ripe, yet reasonably balanced by acid, finishing long and ever so slightly warm. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Au Contraire,30.0,91.0,"Light and spicy, this hails from cool-climate sites. It is exhilarating in cinnamon and clove, with a structured core of wild strawberry and a finish of fennel. The aromas of violet that waft forward on the nose are incredibly inviting, as is the wine's silky texture."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Dr. F. Weins-Prüm,30.0,91.0,"This is rather sweet—loaded with honeyed peaches and tropical fruit—but all of those ripe, rich flavors are brought into focus by the citrus- and mineral-edged finish. It's luscious now, but in 5–10 years it should be a complex, filigreed table wine."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Robert Oatley,30.0,91.0,"This is plump, custardy, leesy wine, with ample texture to support the flavors of toasted marshmallow, melon and citrus. It's plush and round on the lingering finish. Drink now–2018."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sineann,30.0,91.0,"This dark, full-bodied and well-balanced effort is jam-packed with flavor. A big burst of blackberry, blue plum and black cherry holds down the center palate. It's focused, fresh, ripe and lingers broadly. It's a wine to buy by the case and drink over the next decade."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lafon-Rochet,30.0,91.0,"Lafon-Rochet is an estate that is producing some very fine wines. This second wine is a good reflection of the quality. With its powerful tannins and dark concentration, it is a still young. Blackberry fruits are paired with the dry core of tannin to give a wine for aging. Drink from 2019."
Tinta Francisca,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,30.0,91.0,"Tinta Francisca is one of the older varieties of the Douro, generally passed over in new vineyards. Perfumed, ripe and with an almost intense acidity, there is a dry core of tannins that are balanced by ripe red berry fruits, showing concentration from old vines. The wine is still young, finishing with considerable acidity. Drink from 2017."
White Blend,South Africa,Swartland,Sequillo,30.0,91.0,"Fresh meets floral in this elegant blend. On the nose, there's perky citrus and delicate flowers. The flavors are an excellent balance of minerality and fruit, with a rich, round but delicate overall character that's intriguing and unfolds on the tongue. The finish is clean and cool. A versatile, sophisticated white."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Brian Carter Cellars,30.0,91.0,"This Bordeaux blend is a powerful, dark, earthy wine, scented with Bordeaux-like forest floor, herb and fungus. It's the sort of Cabernet that is not afraid of the grape's true varietal character, and promises to age beautifully. Right now it would need some considerable airing to show its best, but the compact and intriguing finish, with its panorama of earth, green and black tea, spice and cassis, is well worth the wait."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Laetitia,30.0,91.0,"A laser-focused nose of lime zest, limestone and a hint of orange blossom characterize this very refreshing sparkler. The bubbles dance across the tongue with lean, not lush flavors of orange peel and squeezed citrus."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Flichman,30.0,91.0,"This blend of 70% Malbec with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Syrah is woody and smoky up front, with aromas of raw oak, char, shoe polish, blackberry and cassis. The longer it breathes, the better it gets, with black-fruit, baking spice and licorice flavors leading the way to a rich but short finish. Drink through 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Galerie,30.0,91.0,"Subtle in honey and grapefruit, this is a playful wine, vibrant in acidity and swirls of lemon zest that make it simultaneously refreshing and intriguing. Oysters are the obvious call."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,30.0,91.0,"This smooth, wood-aged wine is impressively ripe and stylish. Yellow fruit and pear flavors are spiced with nutmeg and toast from the wood, giving richness and a ripe character that are balanced by acidity. Drink this wine now."
Malbec,US,Washington,Seven Hills,30.0,91.0,"This is an aromatic wine, with generous notes of potpourri, clove, dried herb and purple fruit. The palate is lush and fruit forward, supported by tart, vibrant acidity. It's lovely on its own but should really sing at the dinner table."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,TintoNegro,30.0,91.0,"La Arena (sand) is one of four soil-based 2012 Altamira Malbecs made by TintoNegro, and the similarities among the wines far outweigh the differences. This is ripe and oaky on the nose, but clean and approachable. The palate is medium-to-full in feel, while flavors of black cherry, cassis and vanilla end with mild heat and baking spice notes. Drink through 2020."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,TintoNegro,30.0,91.0,"La Grava (gravel) shows only modest differences from the silt, stone and sand wines in TintoNegro's soil-based series of 2012 Malbecs. Black-fruit aromas, herbal notes and solidity define the nose, while the palate is tight, juicy and racy, with red-fruit acidity. Nervy plum and raspberry flavors come with chocolaty oak and an agile, spicy finish. Drink through 2021."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,TintoNegro,30.0,91.0,"La Piedra (stone) opens with the same ripe berry, plum, licorice and oaky aromas as La Arena, La Grava and El Limo (the other wines in this series). The palate is bright and fairly juicy, with black cherry, dark plum, baking spice and peppery flavors. A firm, lightly toasted, racy finish seems right for this wine. Drink through 2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Ulises Valdez,30.0,91.0,"A voluptuous white wine with a bite of acidity to keep it buoyant and vibrant on the palate, this sings in lemon zest, orange blossom and ripe yellow apple. Lushly layered, it threads a needle of stony, salty complexity, finishing with full-flavored flair."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Gaudin,30.0,91.0,"Produced on a small family-run estate that is surrounded by Bordeaux first growths, this wine is structured and firm. It has dark tannins and black currant fruit, together giving a ripe, smoky wine. The 40-year-old vines add to the concentration of this wine. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,30.0,91.0,"Lemon butter, apple pie crust and hazelnut are first to the aroma party on this carefully crafted Jackson family offering from a vineyard about 400 feet up in limestone-dotted soils. On the palate, strong but integrated acidity carries the myriad citrus, apple and spice flavors to completion."
Boğazkere,Turkey,Ankara,Vinkara,30.0,91.0,"Inky garnet to the eye, this wine offers aromas of cherry, black currant and orange peel. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, white chocolate, bell pepper and violet come alive on the palate amid mouth-coating tannins and nice savory notes. The finish is characterized by a lingering touch of orange zest."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,Prinz Salm,30.0,91.0,"Smoke and dusty mineral notes juxtapose ripe, sweet peach and apricot flavors in this fruity but complex wine. It's as savory as it is sweet, accented by spicy notes of saffron and bee pollen. The finish is long, pristine and refreshing."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Burnt Bridge,30.0,91.0,"This is 58% Grenache, 39% Syrah, and 3% Tempranillo. It's a real fruit salad of a wine—fresh and loaded with strawberries, cherry candy, cola and cream. Forward and fruit-driven, it's enormously appealing and ready to drink right now."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Baigorri,30.0,91.0,"Despite showing rusticity and leather on the bouquet, this smells encouraging and improves with airing as spice and subtle berry aromas take over. A creamy, layered palate is home to cinnamon, dry spice, earth and leathery flavors in addition to tobacco and dried cherry. Residual oak and spice are driving the finish on this mature wine. Drink now through 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Selve,30.0,91.0,"Big, dusty tannins dominate this rich and opulent wine. With black plum and juicy red berries, it is well balanced, the acidity cutting through to point up the richness. Very ready to drink, but it will age. Drink now and until 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Guardian,30.0,91.0,"All of the fruit for this wine comes from Stonetree Vineyard. Bright flower, fresh raspberry, huckleberry and potpourri aromas are followed by full-bodied, layered fruit flavors. Floral notes persist on the finish."
Pinot Nero,Italy,Piedmont,Colombo,30.0,91.0,"This 100% Pinot Nero offers aromas of wild red berry, bread crust and a whiff of light spice. The crisp, linear palate doles out crunchy cherry, strawberry, vanilla, tangerine zest and a hint of hazelnut. An elegant perlage lends finesse."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Cedarville,30.0,91.0,"This engaging, full-bodied and densely textured wine has a great bouquet and structured yet fine-grained tannins. It exudes an engaging mix of spices, smoke and cedar in the aroma, and serves equally layered and complex fruit and spice flavors. Best after 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Stoller,30.0,91.0,"Here's reserve-level quality in a widely available, moderately priced bottle. It's entirely estate grown, ripe with bright cherry fruit, and a finish that resonates with granite and earth."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Abadia Retuerta,30.0,91.0,"Earthy black-fruit aromas are a bit tough and gritty. This feels rugged, full in body and tannic. Ripe, earthy blackberry and cassis flavors are spicy, with a strong back note of espresso. A full, toasty finish tastes mostly of straight black coffee. Drink through 2021."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Amalie Robert,30.0,91.0,"There's never more than a barrel of this outstanding wine to go around, but it's well worth hunting down. Powerful and lush, it's got a silky, voluptuously fruity mouthfeel. Candied citrus and apple pie come to mind, as the flavors continue rushing through, finishing with a spicy lift and a whiff of menthol."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Argyle,30.0,91.0,"This is fruit-powered Riesling, finished dry but with a touch of residual sugar to soften the acids. Apple and Meyer lemon fruit flavors intermingle, sporting abundant, juicy natural acidity."
Riesling,US,Idaho,Koenig Vineyards,30.0,91.0,"Coming in at 159g/L residual sugar, this wine is über-aromatic, with notes of dried apricot, pineapple, flowers, and honey, showing layer of complexity. Given the richness of the aromas, the palate is surprisingly deft and light on its feet, displaying a lot of grace and detail to the sugary-sweet flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Obelisco Estate,30.0,91.0,"This is the most available of all the new releases from this important new winery and vineyard on Red Mountain. It sets up with black cherry, plum and blackberry fruits, annotated with clove and coffee. Perfectly balanced and kept at a moderate 13.7% alcohol, this Cabernet-dominated Bordeaux blend is graceful and refined, built for food and cellarworthy for up to a decade."
Rosé,US,California,Murrieta's Well,30.0,91.0,"Seriously refreshing, this pink and copper-colored medium-bodied wine has dazzling citrus aromas, pink grapefruit and raspberry flavors and great acidity that wakes up the taste buds. Made from Grenache and Counoise grapes, it's just the thing for an alfresco lunch or to pour with appetizers before dinner."
Albariño,US,California,Brecon Estate,30.0,91.0,"Clean lines of grapefruit, lime and lemongrass make for a fresh, somewhat angular nose on this zesty tongue-tingling bottling. The palate begins with a round orange-candy flavor and then dives into the sharpness of lime skins and grapefruit peels, with a sizzle of acidity that goes long and deep."
Alicante Bouschet,US,California,Villa San Juliette,30.0,91.0,"Rich caramel and fudge tones mix with inviting crushed purple flowers, baked blackberries and vanilla on the nose of this bottling that features a red-fleshed grape rarely used alone. The palate is sharper than the lavish nose suggests, with fresh crushed elderberries and dried fennel spice."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Klipfel,30.0,91.0,"Certainly sweet, this is a rich wine that is maturing well. It has weight and spice and a soft, opulent texture. It's sourced from grapes grown on the steep slopes above the city of Barr. Drink now and until 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sanford,30.0,91.0,"Sweet lemon blossoms and fresh-pressed tangerines provide the juicy core to the nose on this appellation blend, which gains aromatic complexity from the sharper orange rind and slate minerality. Sea salt and Meyer-lemon flavors meet with white peach on the palate, which is framed by a chalky grip and is very mouth-watering."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Campo di Sasso,30.0,91.0,"This delicious blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, berries, tilled soil, blue flower and spice. The concentrated palate delivers fleshy black cherry, red currants, black pepper and graphite alongside smooth tannins. The long finish closes on a licorice note."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Dubost,30.0,91.0,"Beeswax, light yellow melon, yellow peach and a touch of peach custard show on the nose of this blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Picpoul Blanc and Viognier. Lime zest and yellow pear dominate the palate, which is light, fresh, intriguingly textured and full of acidic sizzle."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,30.0,91.0,"This wine is an equal split between Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Heady black cherry and dark-fruit aromas lead to pitch-black-fruit flavors, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen."
Tempranillo,US,California,Spann Vineyards,30.0,91.0,"This well-balanced wine tames the tannins and brings to the table a relaxed texture plus layers of fruit, spice and oak flavors. Still it has great underpinnings of ripe cherry and raspberry, plus a sense of completeness and reserve."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey,30.0,91.0,"Fragrant notes of both green zingy fresh apples and more mellow baked apple fill the nose. The palate follows this with yeasty autolysis reminiscent of sourdough bread, dark honey and more refreshing green apple. The palate is lithe, dry and elegant with fine mousse and makes for a mouth-watering finish and a classy apéritif."
Red Blend,France,France Other,Domaine d'Alzipratu,30.0,91.0,"This wood-aged wine is ripe with black fruits and dense with dark tannins. It has a warm feel to its structure, developing into a concentrated, black-plum-flavored wine backed by toast and firm tannins. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Buxy,30.0,91.0,"This is bright and fruity wine that has a smoky character as well as brilliant black fruits and acidity. Aromatic and concentrated, the wine is still developing, still with considerable acidity. That will broaden out as the wine matures to give a rich, always lively wine. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,30.0,91.0,"A signature wine for this winery, this directly appealing offering carries notes of herbs, flowers, cherry and chocolate. It's chock-full of elegantly styled cherry flavors, with chocolate that lingers on the finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Wirra Wirra,30.0,91.0,"Like so many of the 2010 Shirazes from South Australia, this is a terrific wine. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without going over the top, and the bold, oak-derived aromas of toast and vanilla ably frame flavors of black olive and plum. Already very drinkable, it should still be going strong in 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Trust,30.0,91.0,"Aromatically alluring, this features notes of raspberries, Red Vines and cherry candy. It brings a full-bore, plush, richly flavored feel with abundant raspberry flavors that linger on the finish—an unapologetically lush example of 2012 vintage fruit."
Syrah,US,California,Martin Lane Winery,30.0,91.0,"This late-release wine has distinctive, enticing aromas like cedar, mushrooms and cigar box. Along with mellow fruity, savory flavors, these contribute to a beautifully mature character. It is medium to full in body, very smooth in texture due to softened tannins, and lasting on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Fouassier,30.0,91.0,"Grown on southwest-facing slopes, this is a ripe, full wine with a natural warmth as well as a mineral texture. It is still tight and needs to age with its gooseberry and herbal edge as well as more flinty, smoky background. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,South Africa,Coastal Region,De Toren,30.0,91.0,"Plum and rose on the nose introduces this beautiful blend from De Toren, and on the palate, it shows ample structure and firm tannins with a shock of acidity that brings freshness to the overall flavor profile. Subtle, reserved strains of spice and soft fruit flavors end up with a clean and fresh twist. A unique and attractive wine at a good price."
Syrah,US,Oregon,Jaxon,30.0,91.0,"This interesting, complex wine moves from tangy candied citrus to baking spices and long concentrated flavors of dried plum, apricot and more. Think Christmas fruitcake with a touch of leather and you're there."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Matsu,30.0,91.0,"This firm, tannic wine's plum and black cherry aromas are matched by oaky maple and spice scents. Toasty, spicy black fruit and mocha flavors finish with a wave of toast, chocolate and spice. This is more bullish than elegant; drink through 2021."
Malbec,US,California,Miraflores,30.0,91.0,"Bold, but complete and well-balanced, this full-bodied wine from a Sierra Foothills stalwart is packed with opulent black plum and cassis flavors and a firmly tannic texture. It starts with lightly smoky, peppery aromas and finishes with lingering fruit, spice and mocha notes. Best after 2020."
Syrah,South Africa,Western Cape,Bizoe,30.0,91.0,"Only 30 cases of this gorgeous wine are imported, so snag what you can when you find it. It's a deep and complex Syrah, exuding attractive aromas and flavors of juicy red cherry and fresh raspberry spiced up with accents of vanilla crème, sweet wood, soft Earl Gray tea and whole baking spice on the close. Creamy and lush with a silky texture; drink now–2014."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sarah's Vineyard,30.0,91.0,"A brawny, hearty and inviting nose of macerated bramble and lush cherry are enhanced by sarsaparilla, leather and turned loam on this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1922. Nutmeg and kola-nut spice enliven the brightly acidic cherry, plum and strawberry fruit. Lilacs and gravel minerality ensue as well, and it all finishes tartly on plum skins."
Syrah,US,Washington,Syncline,30.0,91.0,"Coming from 12-year-old plantings that are just starting to hit their stride, this wine shows brooding notes of blueberry, rhubarb, herbs and espresso. The flavors show intensity and restraint with slightly gritty tannins."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Céline et Frédéric Gueguen,30.0,91.0,"On the right bank of the Serein river, Vaucoupin gives rich wines, showing its sunny exposition. This bottling is ripe, full in the mouth and intense with fragrant white fruits, vanilla and youthful acidity. With freshness still to the fore, it will age and will be better from 2017."
Merlot,US,Washington,Gamache,30.0,91.0,"Consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes has imprinted his benchmark style on Gamache fruit. This is a big, ripe, blocky but powerful wine—all Merlot as only Washington State can grow it. The ripe cassis fruit is enveloped in a mix of French and American oak, half new, yielding strong flavors of smoke, tobacco and mocha. A blockbuster style, ready to drink right now."
Tinta Fina,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Mayor,30.0,91.0,"Raspberry and plum aromas are clean and welcoming. This is a firm, well-built wine, with crisp acidity and solid but not grating tannins. Flavors of toast, chocolate, blackberry and plum precede a chocolaty, warm, cushioned finish. Drink through 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,30.0,91.0,"Delicious fruit aromas and abundant spices waft up from the glass. The flavors follow suit, with ripe plum, strawberry and cinnamon all well supported by firm acidity and a medium-to-full body. This is a well-rounded wine that's easy to enjoy."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Lemos & Van Zeller,30.0,91.0,"This is a firmly structured wine that's powerful and rich. A dark, brooding quality powers the complex balance between fruit and tannins. It has the potential to be a beautiful, ripe, impressive wine with a strong sense of minerality. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Franc-Merlot,US,Washington,14 Hands,30.0,91.0,"Cabernet Franc makes up almost two-thirds of this wine, with the rest Merlot. Aromas of vanilla, cocoa, baking spice, flowers and cherry are followed by plentiful dark-fruit flavors and a tart finish, with the tannins providing a squeeze."
Petit Verdot,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,30.0,91.0,"Potting soil, pencil lead, vanilla, flower and cherry aromas lead to dense, pitch-black-fruit flavors. There's a lot of tannic heft but it's well integrated."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Cristom,30.0,91.0,"Pretty is the word that comes to mind upon sniffing and sipping this wine, with its beguiling strawberry and cherry fruit. It gathers strength in its core, while maintaining an elegant, well-structured acid/tannin frame. It's an outstanding value in Oregon Pinot from a top producer."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Max Ferd. Richter,30.0,91.0,"Wide streaks of saffron, caramel and honey along with a deep mineral core hint to the maturity of this complex sparkling Riesling. Rich yellow cherry and peach flavors persist on the palate, buoyed by soft, delicate mousse and striking lemonade acidity."
Pinot Noir,France,Loire Valley,Daniel Chotard,30.0,91.0,"Wood aged and ripe, this is a structured wine that is full of fruit and still young. It has bright cherry flavors that have been softened and smoothed out by the wood aging. There is also a mineral edge to the fruitiness. It will be a rich wine but it needs more time. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Gainey,30.0,91.0,"A solid Pinot Noir for its price, this offers all the expected flavors and strikes a balance between richness and freshness. Wild cherry, anise, sagebrush and slate aromas lead into a palate that packs ripe red fruit upfront, followed by tangy elderberry, plum skin, hibiscus and rose. A touch of elderflower adds depth."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Casal da Coelheira,30.0,91.0,"With a significant proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a solid, tannic wine. It is also rich, complex and fruity. Fermentation in open lagares gives extra fruitiness, soft extract and great acidity. Drink from 2017."
Viognier,France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette,30.0,91.0,"Made from Viognier grown in the Gaillac region, this is a rich wine with tropical and yellow fruit flavors. The wood aging shows gently through the fresh fruit and attractive acidity. The wine is ready to drink, but will improve until 2018."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Bird,30.0,91.0,"Sourced from the Omaka Valley, this Pinot Noir is fermented and aged in 1000-liter casks, hence the Big Barrel moniker. It's medium bodied and silky in texture, with only minimal oak-derived flavor. Instead it offers crisp red fruits like cherries and pomegranates, plus subtle hints of tomato leaf and smoked meat. Drink now–2021."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carlisle,30.0,91.0,"The great majority of this wine is made from old-vine grapes, planted pre-Prohibition. The age tells tales of soft leathery chewiness on the palate as swathes of cherry-syrup flavor make for a hearty velvety explosion that's lengthy and rich. Black licorice plays a part."
Port,Portugal,Port,Duorum,30.0,91.0,"Made from a field blend, this Port is rich and packed with fruit. The tannins and juicy black plums are balanced by prune, spice and a hint of wood aging. Drink this wine from now and until 2022."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Dauvergne & Ranvier,30.0,91.0,"This selection shows pure black-cherry fruit on the nose, then it folds in hints of flowers, spices, chocolate and coffee on the palate. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without being heavy, then finishes long. Ready to drink, but should easily hold another 5–6 years."
Red Blend,Spain,Central Spain,Finca Constancia,30.0,91.0,"Floral-based aromas of violet and blueberry announce this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot that also smells of hickory and campfire. A choppy, drawn-in palate is herbal and savory, with blatant oak accenting earthy berry flavors. A roasted finish with hard tannins calls for more aging or decanting. Drink through 2023."
Merlot,US,Washington,Forgeron,30.0,91.0,"This combines Merlot from Minnick Hills and Birch Creek vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley and Candy Mountain in the larger Columbia Valley with smaller amounts of Malbec from StoneTree and Petit Verdot from Dionysus. It's generous in aroma, with with plentiful coffee, raspberry, bittersweet chocolate, flower and graphite notes. The palate displays a lot of elegance, with tart acidity providing support. It's a very pretty expression of the variety that should show especially well at the dinner table."
Grenache Blanc,US,Washington,Syncline,30.0,91.0,"Grenache Blanc is an up-and-coming variety in the state. This standout example brings talc, flower, pear and citrus aromas. The medium-bodied palate is tart and lively, piquing interest."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Yves Giroux,30.0,91.0,"This balanced wine, full of ripe fruits, also has good acidity and a crisp citrus edge. It conveys a warm character, the apricot freshened by lemon flavors and given a tangy aftertaste. Drink now."
Chardonnay,Austria,Burgenland,Kollwentz,30.0,91.0,"Rich and creamy, yellow fruit ripeness over lime zest acidity. This is powerful wine, although not heavy, its acidity bursting out through the complex flavors."
Syrah,US,California,South Coast,30.0,91.0,"This wine shows bacon fat, boysenberry and tarragon on the nose. It's full and ripe on the palate, bringing similar flavors, also showing blackberry, roasted pork and black pepper. It proves quite delicious and just what one expects from a warmer-climate Syrah."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut-Macô,30.0,91.0,"This huge, rich wine has weight and density. What make it still recognizably Bordeaux are the black currant fruits, acidity and the stylish tannins. Everything else is larger than life, with power and concentration. Drink from 2018. Owners Mallet Frères use parcel selection for this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine du Colombier,30.0,91.0,"This may not be as potent or complex as Colombier's Cuvée Gaby, but it comes close, which makes it an excellent value. Meaty, savory notes are ideally suited for accompanying autumn game or winter stews, yet the tannins are supple, making it approachable already."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Fielding Hills,30.0,91.0,"Appealing aromas of coffee, cherry, vanilla, woodspice, mesquite and herbs lead to concentrated, rich cherry and chocolate flavors that linger. It's drinking well now but also should have a long life ahead of it in the cellar."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,30.0,91.0,"Mandarin zest and the tenderest suspicion of rose petals hold lots of promise. This satisfying aroma continues on the medium-sweet palate where sweet citrus flesh meets spicy, aromatic orange peel. Lightness of touch marks this as a paradigm of subtlety, and its purity lingers."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Château Vitallis,30.0,91.0,"This impressive wood-aged wine shows both the rich side of Pouilly Fuissé and its taut, minerally character. It is full and rich, yet always expressing a nervy, zingy edge. Age for at least three years."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin,30.0,91.0,"This has a warm, rounded character, with pressing minerality. Notes of apple, pear and a touch of vanilla all add richness and an open character. It has warm, rich fruit on the finish."
Red Blend,Israel,Judean Hills,Flam,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of blackberry and cured meat give way to flavors of black cherry, dark plums, fennel bulb, lavender, thyme and a hint of smoke. This wine is surprisingly bright considering the depth of flavor and strength of its chewy tannins, with acidity that holds its own right into the orange-zest finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Solitude,30.0,91.0,"With a rich nose of toasted oak and caramel, this wine, sourced from the Sangiacomo Vineyard, takes on more brightness on the palate—a medium-bodied celebration of green apple flavor with squeezes of tangerine and lime."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,McGregor,30.0,91.0,"Moss and wood notes mingle with violet and lavender perfume on this elegant, subtly nuanced Pinot Noir. Ripe, rich black-cherry and berry flavors are offset by a brisk acidity and a penetrating mineral backbone. It's lovely now, but structured enough, and still boldly tannic, to merit further cellar aging. Drink from 2020–2025."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Patient Cottat,30.0,91.0,"This full, ripe wine offers rich apple and pear flavors as well as considerable acidity. The wine is concentrated in citrus and green fruits which complement each other and add to the rich character. Drink from the end of 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,J. Wilkes,30.0,91.0,"This is a solid Pinot Noir for just $30, with clove- and vanilla-laced cherry pie notes on the nose, evoking warm pastry crust. Deep pomegranate and blackberry flavors show on the palate, as does more baking spice, crushed slate and wet clay minerality."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Berne,30.0,91.0,"As with so many Provence rosés, this wine is dominated by Grenache. That gives the wine a full and fruity character without any hint of heaviness. Ripe red fruits are contrasted with a zingy texture that leaves the wine so fresh in the mouth."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Glatzer,30.0,91.0,"This hard-edged wine has bitter chocolate as well as black-currant flavors. Quite young at this stage, this is a dark, powerful, concentrated wine that has both great fruit and a dense structure. Give it four years to mature."
Roussanne-Viognier,US,California,Refugio Ranch,30.0,91.0,"This blend of 70% Roussanne and 30% Viognier makes a great option for those seeking an strong white wine alternative to rich Chardonnay. The nose is touched by honey, honeysuckle, crème fraîche and ripe cherimoya fruit. The palate is very creamy and full bodied, with flavors of sea salt, lemon and dried apricot."
Red Blend,US,California,Tooth and Nail,30.0,91.0,"Fat aromas of black cherry, cassis, caramel, oak and vanilla quickly pull the nose into this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 7% Petite Sirah. The exuberance is dialed back on the sip, where tart black-plum skin, roast beef and pepper spice flavors abound."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Carlos Serres,30.0,91.0,"Mellow on the nose, with red fruit aromas, freshness, hints of tobacco and marzipan. Feels flush in the mouth and lifted by fine acids, while it tastes of dried berry and plum, with dark spice accents. Shows a touch of espresso bitterness on a long finish. A keeper to drink now through 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Ziata,30.0,91.0,"Nutty and slightly reduced on the nose, this wine shines in tart acidity and fleshy texture. Lemon peel, pineapple and mango notes give it a wealth of fresh fruit flavor, a lilt of lemongrass providing a touch of spice."
Rhône-style Red Blend,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,30.0,91.0,"A classic northern Rhône valley blend of Syrah with a touch of Viognier, this massive wine is made from grapes grown on granite soil, which leaves its mark in dense minerality and great power. It is a wine for lovers of the big stuff, concentrated and needing to age. Drink from 2018."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Matias Riccitelli,30.0,91.0,"Concentrated, ripe blackberry and cassis aromas come with peppery spice and cedary oak notes. This is big and generous on the palate, with roasted, well-oaked blackberry flavors. A touch of heat lends sizzle to the finish. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,Chile,Maipo Valley,Santa Alicia,30.0,91.0,"A harmonious mix of dry spice, herbal berry and rubbery aromas sets up a full-bodied palate that's brimming with ample oak and firm tannins. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is rugged but generous, with loads of raspberry, plum and herbal flavors resting before an earthy finish of acidic vitality, tomato notes and herbal impressions. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,30.0,91.0,"Merlot (43%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) take the lead on this supremely appealing blend that hails from a who's who selection of vineyards. Notes of black raspberries, currant and milk chocolate come with sweet, luscious fruit flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Vignobles Berthier,30.0,91.0,"This is part of the range of three wines from different soils. Marne, or clay and chalk soil, is relatively heavy and produces a rich style of Sauvignon Blanc. This brings out the more tropical fruits and ripe pineapple that dominate the youthful acidity that cuts through the texture. Drink from 2016."
Syrah,US,California,Miraflores,30.0,91.0,"Bold but also harmonious, this full-bodied, dry wine blends dark fruit flavors with mild spice and chocolate notes for a mouth-filling, palate-pleasing and attractively complex personality. Extra bottle age helps it bring together several flavor threads that are fun to pick out."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,14 Hands,30.0,91.0,"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Malbec, 18% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc, brings barrel aromas of cocoa and chocolate that complement the cherry and plum notes. The flavors are soft and supple with some firmness to the tannins that still need some time to soften."
Riesling,Italy,Piedmont,Germano Ettore,30.0,91.0,"Fragrant and crisp, this has delicate aromas of yellow stone fruit, grapefruit, crushed stone and a whiff of aromatic herb. The vibrant palate doles out yellow peach, Meyer lemon, mineral and a hint of sage alongside racy acidity."
Malbec,US,Washington,Kiona,30.0,91.0,"A wine club selection, this pure Malbec is fragrant and streaked with well-defined layers of blackberry, dark chocolate and earth. There's a pleasing whiff of sandalwood and baking spice that carries through to the finish."
Riesling,Canada,Ontario,Cave Spring,30.0,91.0,"A vibrantly aromatic wine, with notes of petrol, marmalade, citrus and flowers. It's rich and honeyed, with a lightly smoky, lingering finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Minuty,30.0,91.0,"This vigorous blend of Grenache (60%), Cinsault (20%, Tibouren (10%) and Syrah (10%) has a good balance between rich fruits and the freshest acidity. While there is a crisp, tangy background, the foreground is ripe with strawberries and apricots. The whole thing is finished with a lively, bright aftertaste."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Jules Taylor,30.0,91.0,"Purists might be inclined to say this wine is too oaky, but this reviewer believes there's ample substance to support the flash. Cedar and vanilla are apparent, but the dominating characteristics of this wine are its ripe fruit and plush texture. Drink now–2020."
Riesling,US,California,Dutton-Goldfield,30.0,91.0,"This bone-dry, steely-textured wine is crisp and bracing due to firm acidity, fruity-but-not-sweet flavors and maybe a touch of tannin that adds to the firm mouthfeel. Like a squeeze of lemon on the pan-roasted fish, it will make a great counterpoint to lots of things on the menu."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,30.0,91.0,"A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, this is supple and substantial, and it breathes lush notes of plum, cassis, black olive, raw wood and mineral, plus a dash of caramel."
Tokaji,Hungary,Tokaj,Királyudvar,30.0,91.0,"Hints of sweet pastry and rising bread entice on this refreshing, dry, yet honeyed sparkling wine made from Tokaj grape varieties. It's brisk on the palate, with a clean cut, but it has all of the waxy, floral qualities of a sweet Tokaj wine. Fantastic now, but it could be even more glorious with five more years in the cellar."
Nero d'Avola,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,COS,30.0,91.0,"Aromas of sunbaked soil, truffle, game, Mediterranean scrub and mature black-skinned fruit lead the nose on this earthy red. Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, the round, delicious palate tastes of ripe black cherry, blackberry, orange zest, spice and chopped herb. Velvety tannins and bright acidity support the juicy flavors. Drink through 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Deaver,30.0,91.0,"Intensity and subtle power are the hallmarks of this full-bodied, very ripe and fruit-saturated wine. While waves of blackberry jam and sweet black cherry coat the tongue, a sense of sweetness and viscosity clings to the sides of the mouth."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lapa,30.0,91.0,"The quinta that produced this wine already has one of Saint Teresa d'Avila's poems etched above its doorway and now it's honoring the 500th anniversary of her birth with this release. This is a solid blend of rich dark fruits that offers earthly comfort. It is spicy, dark and densely structured. Fine acidity keeps the wine fresh at the end. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Hahn,30.0,91.0,"This is a lot of heady wine for a relatively affordable price. Aromas of black-cherry syrup, baked black plum, nutmeg, clove and gingerbread make for an attention-grabbing nose. The hearty palate shows similar elements, along with black peppercorn, Christmas spice, dense blackberry paste, chaparral scrub and pine-forest notes."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,30.0,91.0,"An off-dry character sets the scene for this concentrated, already balanced wine. The Hatschbourg vineyard in the southern Alsace village of Voegtlinshoffen is composed of clay and chalk soil on a southeast-facing slope. It gives exceptional ripeness, as here, a warm and full-bodied wine with great swathes of fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Muxagat,30.0,91.0,"This wine tastes of the hard landscape from which it comes. It is firmly tannic, tough in its youth and packing a structured punch. Impressive, it hints at the black berry fruits that are underneath. Give this wine several years and drink from 2018."
Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Brotte,30.0,91.0,"A tinge of copper to this white's hue suggests a bit of skin contact, and there's a decided textural element and tannic grip on the palate as well. Pear and melon flavors finish refreshing and mouthwatering in spite of the wine's richness. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,South Africa,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,Rustenberg,30.0,91.0,"Rustenberg's Bordeaux-style blend, made with 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot, 2% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc, is a complex and layered wine, with waves of black fruit and earthy spice that dance endlessly on the nose and mouth. Heady notes of blackberry, boysenberry, cassis and fig are spiced by accents of cocoa, tobacco and sweet, charred wood. It's balanced and well structured, with a velvety texture and a peppery finish. Drink now–2020."
Petit Verdot,US,Washington,Seven Hills,30.0,91.0,"The grape's floral component plays against its dense and inky tannins, making this a complete and relatively soft version of pure Petit Verdot. It fills in the usual midpalate hole with juicy fruit and softened tannins. It glides—not a word usually found with this as a varietal—into a silky, fruity, sweetly floral finish."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Januik,30.0,91.0,"This focused effort features fresh-cut apple and pear flavors that are spicy and tightly wrapped with a Bourbon-barrel-like accent. Delicious now, but it can be cellared for a decade at least."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Terra d'Alter,30.0,91.0,"A red-fruited wine, this is fragrant of wood and strawberries. The palate has a smoky, wood-laden character, a ripe plum flavor and a fine line of acidity. A fresh red-currant note marks the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Puccioni,30.0,91.0,"From the 1904 planting at Puccioni Ranch, this impressive wine packs tons of flavor in a soft, peppery, integrated package of red fruit and baking spice. Though weighty and robust, it has an underlying acidity to lend freshness and vibrancy."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Ramos-Pinto,30.0,91.0,"This fine wood-aged wine is rich with ripe yellow fruit and a subtle toasty character. It's smoothly textured, brimming with fruit and spice, finishing on vibrant acidity. Impressive in its youth, it will be better from 2018."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Treana,30.0,91.0,"Lavish yet not overdone aromas of vanilla, plumeria, dried banana and yellow peach arise from the glass in this blend of 45% Viognier, 45% Marsanne and 10% Roussanne. There is a honeyed character to the palate, along with banana, mango and buttered guava bread, proving quite tropical yet very welcoming."
Sangiovese,US,California,Acorn,30.0,91.0,"This lovely wine is balanced in tannin and acidity. Nutty, it has a touch of leather underlying the savory's fruit's baked quality, a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg and warmth. Aged in Hungarian, French and American oak, little of it new, the fruit is allowed to speak and effortlessly charm."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Obidos,Sanguinhal,30.0,91.0,"This is a finely structured wine, rich with a blend that includes Touriga Nacional and Aragonez. Layers of tannins sustain the ripe black fruits and generous texture. The aftertaste shows the wine's fine acidity as well as its touches of wood aging. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lamothe de Haux,30.0,91.0,"This is a fine wine, with wood and fruit both rich and concentrated. It has spice, juicy black fruits and ripe tannins. It is developing slowly and surely and will be ready to drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Januik,30.0,91.0,"More new oak shows here; it's packed with butterscotch and toasted, caramel-coated, apple-flavored fruit. It's tighter, spicier and oakier than the Elerding Vineyard Chardonnay from Januik, though at the moment it seems less complex in the finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,Januik,30.0,91.0,"This has the sharp, spicy excellence of the best Washington Syrahs; it's got precision, depth and texture. The fruit flavors are compact, buttressed with earthy flavors that include iron and mineral and herb. There is a leafy edge to the tannins suggestive of tobacco. It's a complex and fascinating wine that should age well."
Vermentino,France,Provence,Château Sainte-Marguerite,30.0,91.0,"Packed in an elegant bottle, this is a 100% Vermentino (aka Rolle) wine. The wine has a naturally rich character that is generous while also having plenty of acidity. Lemon and ripe apricots combine easily and giving a smooth, creamy aftertaste."
Red Blend,South Africa,Western Cape,Ataraxia,30.0,91.0,"A gorgeous and elegant compositionally undisclosed red blend from winemaker Kevin Grant, this has all the finesse and complexity of a great wine. Bright and inviting with juicy red plum, blueberry, and wild raspberry aromas and flavors laced with hints of smoky, woody spice and minerality. Silky in the mouth with fine tannins and a long, nuanced finish. Drink now."
Red Blend,US,California,Head High,30.0,91.0,"Beautifully concentrated and rich, this wine is so dense with black fruit and dark-chocolate flavors that it's almost chewy. Blended from nine grape varieties, it has a wealth of fine-grained tannins and feels velvety in texture, while the powerful, layered flavors linger on the finish."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Kim Crawford,30.0,91.0,"Full-bodied, plush and ripe, this is a bit of a throwback style of Chardonnay, marrying peach, vanilla and mango notes into a delectable whole. Toasted oak gives a bit of structure without straitjacketing the luscious fruit. Drink now–2018."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Trouillet,30.0,91.0,"This is a ripe impressive style of Pouilly. It has all the right minerality along with a rich texture plus melon and yellow fruits. With concentration and acidity in equal measure, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Martin Ray,30.0,91.0,"Structured despite its impermeable presence of power and alcohol, this wine also sings in crisp red fruit, some of it jammy, but self-possessed. An accompaniment of anise and baked bread play on the sturdy palate."
Chardonnay,US,California,The Calling,30.0,91.0,"Exuberantly fruit-forward and richly layered, this medium- to full-bodied white is tangy with rocky minerality and bursts of citrus in between ginger and nutmeg spice over apple crisp. It lingers luxuriously on the palate."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Château de Campuget,30.0,91.0,"Despite being six years old, this remains an intensely concentrated, dense Syrah. It's full bodied and richly textured on the palate, easily carrying the dark flavors of mocha, licorice and Italian plum to a long, velvety close. Drink now–2020."
Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Other,San Pedro de Yacochuya,30.0,91.0,"This heavy, baked Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend carries all the fingerprints of winemaker Michel Rolland, a partner from the start in this high-end Salta project. Aromas of raisin and leather are rustic and rich. Flavors of mocha, molasses, cassis and chocolate finish with a syrupy feel. Drink sooner rather than later."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lumen,30.0,91.0,"Vanilla cream, marzipan and apple custard hit the nose on this creamy, dairy-inflected bottling, but a fine line of Key-lime rind balances things. Pan-seared apples in lemon juice mesh well with saffron and dandelion as well as buttered toast with lime marmalade on the dynamic palate."
Grenache,US,California,Epiphany,30.0,91.0,"Iron and rose petals mix with hot gravel and olallieberry on the nose of this concentrated bottling by the Fess Parker family's Rhône-variety-focused brand. Dried black cherries and heady anise power the palate, with violet in the background."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,Salomon-Undhof,30.0,91.0,"The brazing lemon freshness of this non-dosed pink sparkler almost sweeps across all the delicious strawberry fruit contained within. The refreshment factor is supreme but if you care to look, there are subtle shades of tart berries: redcurrant and wild strawberry. The slender palate is streamlined, a fact made even more compelling by the very fine, persistent but unobtrusive mousse. This is a sophisticated, sparkling rosé, with a spring in its step and a glint in its eye."
Chardonnay,US,California,Martin Ray,30.0,91.0,"A blend of vineyards including the winery's Mill Station site, this white shines in steely acidity and layers of lemon, lime and grapefruit flavor. Tart and tangy with a light-handed approach to ripeness, it doesn't hold back on complexity, offering subtle vanilla tones on the finish."
White Blend,US,California,Paraduxx,30.0,91.0,"Aged entirely in stainless steel, this combines 67% Viognier, 22% Chardonnay, 6% Roussanne and 5% Marsanne. The sum of the parts is great, opening with a steely bouquet of honeysuckle, followed by a full and lush palate of pineapple and papaya, anchored by gravelly texture."
Cerceal,Portugal,Beira Atlantico,Quinta de Foz de Arouce,30.0,91.0,"Wood fermentation and aging have given this fine wine a strong, toasty character, complementing its natural perfume. It's rich, with layers of acidity, needing time to develop. Drink from 2019."
Red Blend,Chile,Aconcagua Valley,Conde de Velázquez,29.0,91.0,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Amavi,29.0,91.0,"Half was whole-cluster fermented, yielding dense scents and flavors with black olive, herb and a touch of mocha. Cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are smooth and detailed, and the tannins firm and polished."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Roquebrune,29.0,91.0,"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017."
Merlot,US,Washington,Market Vineyards,29.0,91.0,"This is done in an open, palate-friendly style, with rich, generous black fruits accented with cocoa, coffee and caramel. There's a streak of vanilla custard also, and the fruit has enough depth and mass to hold up through a satisfying finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Joh. Jos. Prüm,29.0,91.0,"While subdued and closed off at initial tasting, time and aeration seem to bring out this wine's vibrant tangerine and apricot perfume. The spry palate is delicately sweet, juxtaposing fresh, primary stone fruit and lime flavors against a backdrop of savory earth and nut. It's a quiet wine that should gain power and depth with maturity. Hold until 2020."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Nino Franco,29.0,91.0,"One of the denomination's benchmark bottlings, this fresh yet creamy off-dry sparkler opens with alluring scents of apple, exotic fruit and white peach that carry over to the silky palate along with candied citrus zest. Crisp acidity brightens the rich flavors and creates a refreshing finish."
Cinsault,US,California,Onesta,29.0,91.0,"Jammy aromas and concentrated grape and blackberry flavors pack a lot of fruitiness into this full-bodied and velvet-textured wine. The ripe and almost sweet berry and plum notes gush forth with gusto while the firm, grippy texture keeps the mouthfeel nicely dry and helps clear the palate for the next bite or sip."
Merlot,US,Washington,Barrister,29.0,91.0,"Dwelley Vineyard provides most of the fruit for this Merlot. Toasty barrel aromas are at the fore followed by exotic spices, milk chocolate and cherry. The flavors are plush and jammy, lingering on the finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Dunham,29.0,91.0,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot. Intricate aromas of vanilla, cedar, powdered chocolate, pipe tobacco and black cherry lead to focused, layered fruit and barrel flavors that show persistence."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Sonsierra,29.0,91.0,"Earthy aromas of olive, tobacco, prune and oak set up a palate with drawing tannins. This tastes of coffee, mocha and earthy mixed berries. The finish is meaty in texture, with compatible oak spice and berry-fruit notes."
Grenache,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,29.0,91.0,"The d'Arenberg style favors structure over plushness, even in Grenache. This is crisp and firm, its cranberryish fruit tinged with hints of raspberry, orange zest, cinnamon and clove. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020–2030."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kessler-Haak,29.0,91.0,"This Chardonnay from Dan Kessler and Ellen Haak-Kessler is a blend of of clones 95 and 76, featuring tangerine, pear, and chamomile on the nose.

Sparkling Blend,Italy,Lombardy,Il Mosnel,29.0,91.0,"Here's a lovely sparkling wine that offers a floral fragrance of white flowers and tropical fruit. The palate delivers apple, white peach and a hint of almond. It has a creamy texture and a clean, crisp finish. A classic Franciacorta."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Loring Wine Company,29.0,91.0,"A juicy nose of red cherries and sweet-leaning cranberries is leveled by a strong sagebrush element. More chaparral scrub shows on the palate, along with black pepper and other dark spices, laid across ripe raspberry and dried cherry fruits."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Overberg,Bouchard Finlayson,29.0,91.0,"Wood-grilled peach aromas mingle with notes of orange blossom and almond skins on the nose. Juicy and well balanced, the rich toasty red apple and orange creamsicle flavors lead into the long wood-spiced close. Drink now."
Red Blend,US,California,Joseph Filippi,29.0,91.0,"Strong cola, fresh pomegranate, pressed strawberry and dried spearmint notes show on the nose of this blend of 40% Tempranillo, 32% Petite Sirah, 18% Zinfandel and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from east of Los Angeles. Very intriguing, extremely minty flavors pop on the palate, spicing up the baked blueberry and meaty beef elements."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château d'Ollières,29.0,91.0,"Named after the chalky land where the grapes for this wine are grown, this is a ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine, It also has a tight, mineral texture that comes from the terrain, a crisp edge and packed acidity. Winemaker Charles Rouy has made what is almost a rosé to age and will certainly be better from the end of 2016."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Sainte Marguerite,29.0,91.0,"This is a soft, pepper and red-fruit-flavored wine. Crisp acidity is well integrated into the tangy, mineral texture. The wine has a rich, concentrated feel, perhaps from the low-yield organically farmed vines. It offers a floral, aromatic aftertaste."
Syrah,US,California,Longboard,29.0,91.0,"The winemaker has said he makes Russian River Valley Pinot Noir to support his Syrah habit. Here he offers a compelling case in point, making a velvety, substantial 100% Syrah that's more elegant than overpowering. Mocha-kissed tannins play nicely with black and red berry fruit, providing a structure built to age, through 2021."
Syrah-Petite Sirah,US,Washington,Corvus,29.0,91.0,"A blend of 60% Syrah from Ambassador Vineyard and 40% estate-grown Petite Sirah, this brightly aromatic wine conveys raspberries, dark cherries and vanilla. It's fruit forward, richly flavored with red fruit that leads to a cranberry-filled finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Ousterhout,29.0,91.0,"Seductively tart in lemon pith, cranberry and pomegranate, this refreshing, light-bodied quaff is infinitely enjoyable, both on its own or at the table. It continues to expand on the palate into an increasing array of fresh flavors, finishing in cherry and orange."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,29.0,91.0,"Aromatic stone fruit swings in those lively citrus notes. There is a creamy apple flavor in the background, softening the bold lemon notes. This is pure and lifted, graceful and slender."
Rosé,France,Provence,Bernard Magrez,29.0,91.0,"With a high proportion of the local Rolle grape in the blend, this is a lightly perfumed wine with a strong herbal element. It is a ripe finely structured wine, with great acidity and orange flavors. A style of wine that will be better for a few more months, it should be drunk from late 2017."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Flying Trout,29.0,91.0,"Two-thirds of this wine is Malbec and one-third is Merlot. Aromas of asphalt, plum and orange rind lead to a palate that possesses a lovely sense of balance and length."
Spätburgunder,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,29.0,91.0,"Zestier and more herbaceous than Thörle's other Spätburgunder bottlings, this bristling red offers loads of cool, crisp black cherry and cranberry flavors. Hints of smoked nut and mint lend depth to the mid palate, augmented by fine-grained, persistent tannins. It's a penetrating wine that still needs time but should improve through 2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Ribatejo,Quinta do Cavalinho,29.0,91.0,"Named as commemoration of the Knights Templar whose Portuguese headquarters were in nearby Tomar, this is a seriously rich, opulent wine, full of red berry fruits and dark spices. Flavors of damson, strawberry jelly as well fine acidity all come through. Age for 3–4 years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Navarro,29.0,91.0,"Not a big wine, but a well-balanced, well-behaved one that's sophisticated enough for any setting. It feels smooth and gentle in texture, tastes quietly assertive in flavor and has a refined personality overall—a classic Anderson Valley Pinot."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Aberrant Cellars,29.0,91.0,"Consistent with the 2014 Confero, this blends multiple clones from five different vineyards. Its details are sharp, framing taut red fruit with a vein of licorice before resolving into dusty tannins. It delivers excellent length, muscle and definition."
Rosé,US,New York,Wölffer,29.0,91.0,"Wölffer's dusty pink Grandioso has a saline minerality on the nose, accenting whiffs of raspberry and peach. As with the producer's standard-bottle rosé, the palate is crisp with acidity, but more intensely concentrated with juicy white peach and yellow cherry flavors. The elegant finish carries a touch of cherry blossom perfume."
Grillo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Alessandro di Camporeale,29.0,91.0,"Made with organically farmed fruit, this wine opens with an enticing fragrance of white flower and stone fruit. The savory palate delivers juicy white peach, saline and mineral sensations alongside bright acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Oak Farm,29.0,91.0,"This deftly made wine from a newly built winery in California's San Joaquin Valley balances pure fruit flavors, mildly spicy oak nuances, firm acidity and fine tannins. It has tasty black cherry and raspberrry flavors backed by good acidity and a mouthfeel that's velvety, and should make a great pairing with a variety of proteins."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Nigl,29.0,91.0,An almost apple-like and appetizing contrast between crunchy acidity and ripe fruitfulness makes this a compelling propostion. Primary fruit shines here and is very pure. This is like a crisp crunchy apple bathed in citrus. Pure refreshment with a superclean finish and taut structure.
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Goodfellow,29.0,91.0,"This rich, mouth-coating effort marries Meyer lemon, pink grapefruit and white peach to sappy acidity. It persistently pushes through the palate into a lingering finish, with a lip-licking snap that invites the next sip."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Llopart,29.0,91.0,"This long-aged (42 months) vintage Cava opens with a whiff of exotic bath soap along with more familiar apple and pear scents. There's yeasty, creamy weight to the palate and flavors of fresh-baked bread, spent yeast and papaya. Mild lees and cream notes grace the finish."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Plantagenet,29.0,91.0,"Darker, sterner and less accessible than Plantagenet's Omrah bottling, the winery's flagship Shiraz offers substantial dark fruit flavors reminiscent of espresso, plum and cracked pepper. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 2–3 years of cellaring. (The 2007 is drinking well now.)"
Rosé,France,Provence,Bernard Magrez,29.0,91.0,"This wine is ripe and balanced, with a tension between the fresh acidity and mineral texture. The red fruits, stylish and attractively bright, bring out the warmth of the south-facing vineyard. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lestage Simon,29.0,91.0,"Dark colored wine, revealing wood aging both aromatically and to taste. That said, it also has great weight, a powerful and complex wine with its coffee, dried fruit and black plum flavors. It's an impressive, solid wine that deserves at least seven years' aging."
Port,Portugal,Port,Wiese & Krohn,29.0,91.0,"This dry, well-aged tawny definitely tastes more than its 10 years indication. It has strong wood and toast characters and a smoky flavor cut with old-gold acidity. It's complex, dried fruits and nuts coming through at the end."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Agassac,29.0,91.0,"The medieval moated castle of Agassac is a fairytale place. The wine, after serious investments, is now showing well. This 2012 is smooth and rich, with black plum fruits and currants giving a ripe feel. The wood aging is already well integrated in this solid, generous wine. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,29.0,91.0,"Primarily Cabernet Sauvignon (the balance is Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc), this is full bodied, lush and richly textured. Cassis, blackberry, vanilla and tobacco leaf notes give this a convincingly Bordeaux-styled profile, although much riper and plusher. Drink now–2023."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Plantagenet,29.0,91.0,"All three of Plantagenet's Shirazes were successful in 2008. This, the flagship bottling, offers aromas of coffee grounds, cherry and cracked black pepper, adding vanilla, spice and charred beef flavors on the palate. It's harmonious, savory and complex. Drink now–2020 and possibly beyond."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château des Karantes,29.0,91.0,"This La Clape red, made from 50% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, is dark and herbal, with strong aromas of black berries and plum guts supporting the garrigue notes of lavender, thyme and bay leaf. More dark fruit unfolds in the mouth alongside sweet cigar spice and notes of bittersweet chocolate, almost like a spiced Black Forest cake. Big and hedonistic but silky and balanced; drink now–2014."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Volpaia,29.0,91.0,"Enticing scents of blue flower, red berry, sandalwood and a whiff of new leather emerge on this glossy red. The bright, silky palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry and star anise while fresh acidity and polished tannins provide the framework."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Dr. Wagner,29.0,91.0,"This is a prototypical Saar Riesling, with classic green apple and citrus flavors underscored by slate-driven minerality that lingers for a long time on the finish. Despite the sensation of plumpness, the wine is light on its feet. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière,29.0,91.0,"Organic grapes grown on the estate's schist soil go into this delicious, ripe and clean wine. Shot through with a good balance of red berries, red currants and tight acidity, it has good depth of flavor along with a surface glitter of bright freshness."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,DanCin,29.0,91.0,"This lush wine, green/gold in hue, offers mouth-coating flavors with richness and style. Apple, pear and papaya fruit holds down the center, with elements of toasted hazelnuts and butter pecan from aging in 20% new French oak. The creamy, smooth finish is delightful."
Rosé,France,Provence,Maison Angelvin,29.0,91.0,"This Mourvèdre, Grenache and Cinsault blend has ripe, textured red-berry fruits that give weight and richness. A tangy texture, almost mineral, in the background shapes the spicy, peppery aftertaste."
Sparkling Blend,US,Oregon,Lundeen,29.0,91.0,"Made in the traditional method, this is a blend of base wines from the 2011 and 2014 vintages. The freshness of the recent vintage is annotated with mildly mature flavors from the earlier one, creating a delightful wine with rich flavors of lemon, lime, pink grapefruit and a touch of honey. The posh fruit says New World, but the overall elegance nods gracefully in the direction of France."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Robert Karl,29.0,91.0,"Supple and juicy, this young, purple, berry-loaded Cab includes small amounts of the other four Bordeaux grapes in the blend. It's a masterful blending achievement, with each grape seeming to contribute something to the nose, the mouthfeel, the length and the overall focus. Flavors are tightly woven—purple fruits, butterscotch, mocha, moist earth and baking spices—but nothing is overwrought. This will need considerable breathing time to unwrap, and years in the bottle to soften some of the hard edges."
Grüner Veltliner,US,Oregon,Reustle,29.0,91.0,"This reserve bottling, done entirely in stainless, brings extra weight and depth, with an enticing floral top note. Oranges and citrus-peel aromas carry into the palate, and a sense of powdered sugar suggests that perhaps it wasn't fermented completely dry. In any event, it's complex, compact and commanding."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Capitoni,29.0,91.0,"A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 8% Canaiolo and 2% Colorino, this has earthy aromas of truffle, sunbaked soil, leather and a balsamic note. Round and savory, the smooth, polished palate tastes of raspberry jam, ripe black cherry, licorice and a hint of pipe tobacco. Velvety enveloping tannins provide the framework while a dried herb note accents the finish. Enjoy through 2022."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château Jolys,29.0,91.0,"This late harvest wine shows both intense acidity and intense richness. Honey, perfumed lemon and ripe apple notes come together. Still young, it's going to need time for the acidity to soften, so wait to drink until 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Caroline,29.0,91.0,"Not many people have châteaus named after them. But Caroline Chanfreau-Philippon does and now she runs it as part of Château Lestage, both Cru Bourgeois. This is a rich and structured wine that is concentrated, ripe and juicy. With both attractive black-currant fruits typical of the vintage and firm tannins with tight structure, drink this wine from 2020."
Tempranillo,US,California,Straight Line,29.0,91.0,"This wine has rich blueberry aromas, a softly tannic texture and and black currant flavors that open more with each sip. Concentrated and full in body, it's a luxurious-feeling and abundantly flavored wine that lingers long on the palate."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Lombardy,Caven,29.0,91.0,"A Nebbiolo from the steep vineyards of Valtellina, this opens with aromas of crushed violets, perfumed berry, flint and a whiff of Alpine herbs. The bright palate delivers crushed sour cherries, juicy raspberries, grilled sage, tobacco and a hint of vanilla alongside racy acidity and polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
Riesling,US,California,Coquelicot,29.0,91.0,"“Gas station” isn't necessarily the most attractive fine-wine descriptor, but it's both apt and complimentary for a dry Riesling. This one reeks of petrol and tar. On the palate, a warm tar presence slowly evolves toward vanilla. A vibrant, tingling acidity indicates decent cellaring potential. At the very least, this is a great wine to show your friends how petrol can be a defining and excellent character in wine."
Ribolla Gialla,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Dorigo,29.0,91.0,"It's loaded with lemon blossom, yellow apple, white peach, Bartlett pear and citrus sensations with a hint of custard. Creamy texture is brightened by fresh acidity."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram-Donauland,Bernhard Ott,29.0,91.0,"Hints of passion fruit play appetizingly about the more usual pear aromas, and the palate displays a winning combination of fresh, zesty lemon and white pepper. It finishes with pleasant length."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Cap Léon Veyrin,29.0,91.0,"This is a dense and tannic wine. It has plenty of the structure that is common to the Listrac appellation with a firm character when young; however, it also has swathes of ripe black fruits and acidity that will allow it to fill out very satisfactorily. Drink from 2020."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Rabl,29.0,91.0,"This is concentrated fruity and very spicy. It has an intensity of fruit flavor, its nutmeg character balanced by crisp green apples, pear skins and a great depth of acidity. Screwcap."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Stellenbosch,de Trafford,29.0,91.0,"An elegant and refined Chenin that shows superb balance and the potential to age gracefully for another five years, at least. Lush and rich, this has a smooth texture and a round but lifted palate. Aromas and flavors of baked apple and toast are layered with sweet citrus and honeyed richness. The long, strong finish leaves sultry sweet spice and nutty accents behind."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Cantina dei Produttori Nebbiolo di Carema,29.0,91.0,"Rose petal, violet, woodland berry, sage and eucalyptus aromas come together in the glass. The juicy palate doles out ripe strawberry, red cherry, cinnamon-spice and nectarine zest alongside bright acidity and lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2025."
Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,South Africa,Elim,Trizanne,29.0,91.0,"A blend of 51% Sauvignon Blanc and 49% Sémillon, this is a beautifully balanced white. It opens with pretty floral aromas of lemon verbena, fynbos and sweet pea, with supporting fruit tones of citrus and crisp pear at the core. It's lightweight, but nuanced and layered, with waves of plum and lemon-lime citrus that are cut by bright acidity and a hint of toast on the close. Drink now–2021."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Plantagenet,29.0,91.0,"With its expressive notes of espressso and black olive, this Shiraz is on the savory side, but it still carries enough plummy fruit to provide balance. It's mouthfilling and generous, while a bit of tartness on the finish serves to highlight the coffee and earth flavors. Drink now-2017."
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Hillinger,29.0,91.0,"A pleasant vein of freshness runs through this crunchy, refreshing and intriguing red. Notes of cured meat, white and black pepper, earth and red berry all appear at intervals. Underneath it all is a heart of true red fruitiness that flirts pleasingly with notes of undergrowth."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,29.0,91.0,"At 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, this drinks like a Cab, combining ripe cassis and chocolate notes with hints of mint, brown sugar and cinnamon. It's full-bodied and a bit chewy in texture, which should serve it well through at least 2015."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Gotín del Risc,29.0,91.0,"This Mencía is offering up a pretty combo of earth, cola, graphite and black-fruit aromas. The palate pops with lush berry fruit balanced by darkness and weight; flavors of tobacco, earth, berry and cedar impress, while a mossy finish that's long and elegant carries clout but isn't too bullish. Drink through 2016."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Canneto,29.0,91.0,"Here's a savory selection, offering earthy and balsamic aromas of underbrush, tobacco and Mediterranean herbs. The restrained palate reveals ripe plum, cassis and licorice notes layered with chewy tannins and a warm midpalate."
Chardonnay,US,California,Expression 38,29.0,91.0,"Fully integrated in oak and fruit, this medium-bodied vineyard-designate is fleshy in fig, anise and vanilla. Textured and dense, it expands on the palate to show a great generosity of expression and personality."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Domaine le Bout du Lieu,29.0,91.0,A very fine wine with some bottle age that has given the dense tannins a chance to integrate beautifully into its sweet fruit. There is a bitter chocolate edge that comes from the wood aging. It has a dark and very structured aftertaste.
Malbec,Argentina,Other,Anko,29.0,91.0,"This big-boned Malbec from northern Argentina is full of brawny black-fruit aromas accented by pencil eraser, herbal scents and leafy notes. The mouthfeel is scratchy on the surface and chewy at its base, while flavors of clove, spice, herbs and baked black fruits are harmonious and impressive."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Naia,29.0,91.0,"Smoky, toasty and without a doubt barrel fermented. This feels a little raw and tannic for a white wine, but it's also grippy, elevated and fruity. On the palate, things open with a blast of apple and raw oak; the finish is long and tastes of butterscotch and dried apple. A classy wine from some of the oldest vines in Rueda."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sextant,29.0,91.0,"Dark in the glass, this bottling shows strawberry, black plum and gingerbread aromas on the inviting nose. The mouthfeel is airy and relatively light, with a strong tannic tension that frames flavors of dark purple fruit and baking spice."
Syrah,US,Idaho,Cinder,29.0,91.0,"Cinder is quietly one of the wineries carrying the banner for this nascent growing region. The aromas here are sappy and brooding, with notes of Marionberry, huckleberry, bittersweet chocolate and a spice top note. The blue-fruit flavors show an alluring sense of purity and grace that carries through the finish, which includes a savory note that heightens the interest. Delicious stuff."
Syrah,US,Washington,Beresan,29.0,91.0,"Fragrant and expressive, it's got a wonderful lift to the plummy fruit which is spiced up with clove and gamy scents of smoked and cured meats. This is not your typical jammy, fruit-driven Syrah; it's much tighter and more Rhône-like, with fine natural acids and aging potential of up to a decade."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Mersiol,29.0,91.0,"Yellow-apple notes are clearly expressed on the nose. They also appear with lovely purity on the balanced dry palate which has a rich backdrop of autolysis with hints of rye bread. The mousse is fine and creamy, the finish is dry and lasting."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Jean-Marc Brocard,29.0,91.0,"Generous in style, with great freshness. The flavors are rich, touched by caramel, ripe white currants and some spice. A fine, red apple skin structure comes through to finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Jenke,29.0,91.0,"This wine is much more convincing than Jenke's 2005 Cabernet, reinforcing the concept that Barossa Cab typically performs better in cooler years (2002 was the coolest on record). It's still broad and mouthfilling, but the plum and cassis flavors stay this side of overripe, buttressed by plenty of smoke, vanilla and spice. Long and savory on the finish. Drink now–2015. Imported by 34th Parallel, LLC."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château les Valentines,29.0,91.0,"The La Londe appellation came into existence in 2008 and this wine celebrates that fact. Rounded and smooth, it has a touch of saltiness as well as dried red berry fruits and intense acidity. Drink from the end of 2014."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,29.0,91.0,"While dry in style, this wine is chock full of ripe, rich yellow peach flavor accented with hints of dusty, floral potpourri and mineral tones. Its bold, expansive mouthfeel is penetrating on the palate, but cut with a line of lime acidity that lingers long on the finish. Delicious now, but its sharp edges and dark mineral tones should meld beautifully from 2019–2021."
Malbec,US,Washington,Baer,29.0,91.0,"This wine's aromas are vibrant and fruit forward, with plum, blackberry seed, barrel spice, herb and clove notes. The palate delivers plush, tart, textured flavors. A compelling example of the variety."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,Schloss Gobelsburg,29.0,91.0,"A nose of honeyed autolysis is most inviting, while the palate does not disappoint with its bready notes of citrus, fine persistent bubbles and round mouthfeel, yet with that wonderfully zesty focus of acidity. This delivers exactly where it should—on the midpalate and the long, superclean finish that leaves lingering notes of lemon shortbread."
Malbec,Chile,Maipo Valley,Viña Chocalan,29.0,91.0,"Heavy oak, vanilla and lightly herbal black-fruit aromas are savory and border on soupy. In the mouth, this is rich, saturated and jammy. Flavors of maple, chocolate and toast accent fully extracted dark-fruit flavors. Full chewy tannins result in a pounding finish. Drink through 2022."
Riesling,Austria,Vienna,Hajszan Neumann,29.0,91.0,"A wonderful perfume of citrus zest and the subtlest hint of aromatic pine. The palate shines with rounded but zesty citrus and shows immense concentration for such a zippy, slender wine. This is like dancing on a high-wire and terribly animating."
Gamay Noir,US,Oregon,Brick House,29.0,91.0,"Brick House was one of the first to plant Gamay Noir in the Willamette Valley, and may well be the state's leading producer in terms of quantity. This is loaded with chunky cherry fruit, a penetrating style that simply brings a grin with every sip. Aromatics of root beer, sassafras and hard cherry candy add to the complexity."
Grenache,Australia,South Australia,Chapel Hill,29.0,91.0,"This ripe Grenache is full-bodied and fruit-driven, but seems to have the stuffing to last at least 3–4 years. Cherry-berry flavors are punched up by herb and spice shadings that linger on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,J. Christopher,29.0,91.0,"To call it entry level does not do justice to the quality here—this would be reserve level at many wineries. A generous mix of blueberry and black cherry fruit rolls seamlessly through the fruit-driven core, annotated with barrel notes of cola, coffee and cream."
Malbec,US,Oregon,Beresan,29.0,91.0,"As with all Beresan reds, this tilts sharply in the direction of dark fruits, earthy tannins, and streaks of iron and herb. The plum and berry flavors are framed in sappy acids, and the purity of the single-varietal wine is impressive. It's a fine alternative to Cabernet with that thick steak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Cameron Hughes,29.0,91.0,"This is an impressive wine at any price, but it would be hard to find much in the way of a better deal for Napa Cab. Smooth, rounded edges surround a full-bodied expression of dense black fruit, cedar and clove. The wine finished with plenty of length to age. Drink now through 2021."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Dürnberg,29.0,91.0,"A single-vineyard wine that displays creamed pear and apple flavors, softly touched with wood. It's an elegant wine, although whether wood aging and Grüner go together is a debateable point. Let the wood soften and it will show more of the ripe fruit. Screwcap."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Rust en Vrede,29.0,91.0,"This is a ripe and dense yet well-balanced wine, offering forward aromas of boysenberry and deep, juicy red plum that are accented by notes of cocoa nib, roasted espresso and char. The palate boasts a plush texture, like crushed velvet, with gripping but not overly firm tannins and concentrated fruit flavors. Notes of licorice and earthy tobacco grace the long finish. Approachable now, but should evolve well through 2021."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,29.0,91.0,"Excellent concentration impresses here, with a full-throttle mix of citrus, apple, pear and peach fruit. Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this spent five months on the lees and offers length and balance."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Northstar,29.0,91.0,"This wine is predominantly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with pinches of Syrah and Cabernet Franc blended in. Baking spice, cocoa and berry aromas lead to a layered cherry flavors that show intensity and persistence."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey,29.0,91.0,"Beautifully fruity notes of fresh and baked apples create an inviting nose. The palate fizzes away with creamy mousse and a lovely yeasty autolytic edge reminiscent of fresh rye bread. The apple fruit brightens the entire palate and creates a rounded, harmonious and very balanced dry finish."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Harbes Family Vineyard,29.0,91.0,"Wisps of thyme and sage lend herbaceousness to this otherwise plump, densely fruity wine. It's chock full of luscious black-cherry and plum flavors, held taut by firm tannins and crisp cranberry acidity. Velvety and smooth, it's a pleasurable wine to savor through a long spiced Graham-cracker finish. Enjoy now through 2025."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Torre a Cona,29.0,91.0,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, underbrush and a whiff of menthol. The lithe palate offers black wild cherry, crushed raspberry and white pepper alongside firm but polished tannins."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,29.0,91.0,"Chehalem makes four different Rieslings, and this is often the best of them. Rich and complex, it's dense with grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple and flavors of wet stone. Lovely in the mouth, it lingers gracefully through the finish."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,29.0,91.0,"This block selection shows a delicate, elegant touch in this vintage, opening with pretty floral accents and continuing with light but compelling flavors of citrus and honeysuckle. There is a well-tuned bitter streak, presumably from some skin contact, and a refreshing minerality throughout."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Dão Sul,29.0,91.0,"Smoke and tobacco aromas are immediately attractive, and with the delicious, but dry structure, here is a wine that shows both great potential and great elegance. There is power, as witnessed by the alcohol, but it is relatively muted, the berry fruits showing through the tannins, and then the acidity and velvet wood flavors finishing."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Bernard Magrez,29.0,91.0,"This small 24-acre property has produced a powerful, rich 2010 that layers its big black-plum flavor with complex tannins and wood notes. Dry and firm, it is still defiantly young and needs several years to round out."
Chardonnay,US,California,Saddleback,29.0,91.0,"A creamy, unctuous white with a tease of waxy apple, cheese rind and tropical pear, this fuller-bodied expression of the grape takes on generous layers of caramel and ginger as it goes. It finishes in a long, lingering celebration of brioche and allspice."
Gamay,France,France Other,Château de Lavernette,29.0,91.0,"Made from Gamay on the granite soil of Beaujolais (hence the wine's name), this is a just pink colored wine that has apple and orange flavors. It's touched by an steely character that gives the wine texture and will allow it to age in bottle. Drink now, but better from 2017."
Neuburger,Austria,Burgenland,Feiler-Artinger,29.0,91.0,"The slightest touch of creamy vanilla shows on the nose. The palate has a similar, inviting creaminess combined with crisp but friendly lemon freshness. A rounded nuttiness adds interest to this beautifully curvy but toned wine."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Karl Schaefer,29.0,91.0,"Intense smoke and mineral tones mingle with fragrant lemon peel and lavender in this slightly exotic off-dry Riesling. It's buoyantly peachy yet also cutting and spry, finishing bright on a streak of tangerine acidity."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Alvear,29.0,91.0,"Maple, toffee and leather aromas combine nicely on a nutty, driving bouquet. The palate feels narrow and compact, with pointed flavors of saline, nuts and dried apricot. Finishes with power. Made from the Pedro Ximenez grape, not the more common Palomino."
Muscat,Spain,Levante,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega,29.0,91.0,"Honey and corn syrup aromas tell you this is rich, but what you don't realize so easily is how complex and expansive this Muscat is. The flavors of honey, banana and clover start out as sweet and unctuous, but then they unfurl to show depth, complexity and length. In the end you realize that this is all about pure, unrefined power and purity. Drinking it is like a rush of natural sugar to the brain."
Syrah,US,Washington,Beresan,29.0,91.0,"This classy Walla Walla Syrah is still young and tightly wound, with juicy acids and flavors of tart berry and wild mountain fruit. As it opens in the glass it starts to show smoked ham and bacon, with black pepper in the back. Tannins are chewy and right on the border between green and black tea, but the bright raspberry fruit shines through. It's got good, crunchy structure and a substantial finish."
Merlot,US,Washington,Beresan,29.0,91.0,"This is 100% varietal, a 50-50 blend from Waliser and Candy Mountain vineyards. A beautiful color, deep purple, leads into a substantial Merlot with smooth berry flavors. Highlight hints of soy and balsamic are streaked into the midpalate, and the wine sails into a dark, smoky finish, which lasts a minute or longer, sending out a rainbow of flavors suggesting stone fruits and even a bit of papaya."
White Blend,Italy,Italy Other,Rizzi,29.0,91.0,"A blend of 65% Chardonnay, 20% Nebbiolo and 15% Pinot Nero, this delivers ripe pear, golden apple, citrus and hazelnut aromas that carry on to the palate. It's sophisticated and elegant, with radiant acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Colinas do Douro,29.0,91.0,The wine has 12 months of aging to give it extra richness and a ripe full texture. It does have firm tannins although these are already embedded in the rich black fruits. The Douro minerality shows through the texture and acidity at the end. This wine deserves some aging: drink from 2019.
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,SJ Montigny,29.0,91.0,"This intensely mineral wine leads with bold strikes of steel, slate and smoke. But the palate opens gradually, exposing brighter yellow peach and lemon. Taut and dry, it finishes on lingering notes of salt and crushed minerals. It's elegant now but should improve through 2025 and hold further."
Riesling,Germany,Mittelrhein,Matthias Müller,29.0,91.0,"Opulent white blossom and tropical fruit flavors abound in this superripe, concentrated Riesling. Dry in style, it's plump and round in mouthfeel, yet reined in by bristling lime acidity and a rippling vein of minerality. It's a powerful, composed and complex wine."
Zinfandel,US,California,Brooklyn Winery,29.0,91.0,"Balanced for dinner time, and sophisticated in aromas and flavors, this wine stands apart from the pack. The boysenberry and cedar aromas are tempting, and the vivid cherry and berry flavors are satisfying. Enough tannins and acid are woven in to keep the wine refreshing."
Malbec,Argentina,Other,Verum,29.0,91.0,"This wine blends the rich qualities of Malbec with proper acidity and tannic bite, and the result is excellent. Chocolaty aromas of berry fruits and leather set up a bouncy palate with oaky flavors of mocha, plum, herbs and spice. On the finish, it's long and a touch minty. Drink now–2018."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de la Noblaie,29.0,91.0,"A concentrated wine, showing minerality as well as rich and solid tannins. The red cherry and strawberry fruits are already well integrated into the structure of this dark-hued wine. The name refers to the tufa (limestone and chalk) soil that is typical of much of the central Loire."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de la Mordorée,29.0,91.0,"A terrific expression of its appellation, the 2007 La Dame Rousse from Domaine de la Mordorée starts off a bit tight and minerally on the nose, then explodes on the palate with layers of cherries, peaches, warm stones and dried spices. It's full-bodied and rich, with a long, spice-driven finish. Treat it like a light red, serving it with charcuterie or simple grilled meats, and drink it over the next year or so."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Estampa,29.0,91.0,"Rooty aromas of baking spices and black fruits are restrained and delicate on the nose. This is full, round and mildly tannic, with baked plum, berry, spice and peppery flavors. Toast, nutmeg and bright acidity carry the finish on this blend of 71% Carmenère, with additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Drink through 2017."
Syrah,US,California,Jaffurs,29.0,91.0,"This under-$30 wine is perfect for either a weeknight dinner or special event. Round blackberry and black currant fruit pairs with fresh floral and forest floor notes on the nose. Dried black fruit shows on the palate, where concentrated coffee, dill, tar and crushed slate flavors cut through plum skin tang."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Graf Hardegg,29.0,91.0,"Honey and the perfumed notes of quince are immediately apparent on this Spätlese Riesling. The sweetness is carried beautifully by ripe notions of peach, additional quince and apricot coulis, balanced and countered by the fresh, ripe and pliable acidity of oranges and tangerines. This is slightly decadent and very harmonious. Perhaps sweet enough for an apricot tart but certainly a killer with salty blue cheeses. No other grape can perform the same tightrope walk as Riesling. Enjoy."
Chardonnay,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Cembra,29.0,91.0,"Here's a stunning sparkling wine made in the classic method, with no added dosage. It offers citrus, melon, apple, stone fruit, minerality and walnut notes. The creamy palate is supported by crisp freshness and finishes bone-dry."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Malat,29.0,91.0,"The nose gives little away except for a touch of reductive smoke. The palate then presents a streak of zesty freshness, a light ripple of lovely texture and shimmering nuances of white pepper, crushed chervil, salty soy and savory miso. All this comes on a very light body, finishing with a bright, friendly note of lemon."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Chandler Reach,29.0,91.0,"A full six-years-old, this is a quality example of this extremely cool vintage. A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, the aromas are vibrant but seem ever so slightly dried out, with notes of anise, cassis and blackberry. The red and black-fruit flavors display a fine sense of balance and length that keeps the interest high."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,El Centimo,29.0,91.0,"Fresh plum, tomato and spice aromas are integrated. On the palate, this wine is ripe and saturated but not heavy. Generous flavors of caramel, vanilla, plum and berry fruits are smooth and chocolaty across the finish. Drink now through 2020."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Ninot,29.0,91.0,"With light wood-aging flavors, this wine is both ripe and fresh. The touch of toast points up yellow fruits that are generous and rounded. Pineapple and peach are given an edge by the citrus acidity in the aftertaste. Drink from 2017. The family estate has been established since the 14th century."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Balletto,29.0,91.0,"One of the producer's larger-production offerings, this wine nonetheless speaks to meticulous attention in the vineyard and cellar, with velvety smoothness to the palate and savory elements of earthy mushroom. Nuanced, it ends in rose petals and black tea, with firm, crisp acidity throughout, all at an almost unheard-of price for the quality."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,J. Christopher,29.0,91.0,"Forward, fruity and flavorful, this is a quite pretty compendium of raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with a touch of orange peel. As with J. Christopher's pricier cuvées, it spent 18 months in one-quarter new French oak. Though labeled simply Willamette Valley, the fruit was sourced principally from the prestigious Dundee Hills AVA."
Syrah,US,Oregon,Quady North,29.0,91.0,"Not to be confused with the Mae's “Flagship” bottling, which is a more limited reserve, this classy and varietally spot-on wine brings coffee concentrate, red licorice, black cherry cola and a streak of vanilla harmoniously together. The focus and purity are outstanding."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Pearl and Stone,29.0,91.0,"Sourced from the Two Blondes vineyard, this is a soft, smooth and toasty blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Cabernet Franc, and 27% Merlot. Its delicious barrel flavors are nicely integrated with its purple fruit. It's buttery-feeling in the mouth, with coffee and toasted nut accents, all bolstered by a firm structure of ripe, slightly grainy tannins. Drink now through 2030."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Maison Stéphane Brocard,29.0,91.0,"Sourced from the same three parcels each vintage, this is shot through with minerality and tight acidity. There is fruit behind this tension and that gives the wine both balance and also aging potential. Drink this complex wine from 2018."
Malbec,US,Oregon,Troon,29.0,91.0,"So dark the wine stains the glass the instant it's poured, this plush, dense and pure varietal effort pulls together crushed raspberries, ripe cherries, tanned leather, cut tobacco, cedar and spice components. They are well-matched and captivating; the aromas are like sticking your nose into an especially spicy cigar box."
Zinfandel,US,California,Lula,29.0,91.0,This substantial dry wine made from dry-farmed vines planted in 1980 has tempting jammy aromas and ripe and satisfying fruit flavors matched by a solid backing of fine-grained tannins and acidity. It has the appetizing bite and firm texture that will make it mouthwatering at dinner.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Reverdi,29.0,91.0,"Owned by the Thomas family, this wine has an unusual blend of 50% Merlot and 35% Petit Verdot (with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon). It shows how Petit Verdot can now ripen easily in warm years. The dark color and dense tannins are a counterpoint to the juicy blackberry fruit. They will allow this wine to age well. Drink from 2021."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Two Vintners,29.0,91.0,"It's hard to ignore the high alcohol listing, but the wine is so well balanced and cohesive that few would even notice. It's aromatic with notes of dried and fresh cranberries and raspberries. The palate is full bodied and rich with concentrated, pure fruit flavors."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Kangarilla Road,29.0,91.0,"Is there any doubt that 2012 is a superb vintage for South Australian Shiraz? Here's another fine example, boasting sumptuous levels of black cherry fruit framed by hints of brown sugar, roasted meat, cinnamon and allspice. It's full-bodied and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish. Drink 2018–2030."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Beltane Ranch,29.0,91.0,"A block-designated wine, this shows both purpose and focus, offering a linear expression of stony minerality, crisp lemon and peach. To complement that vibrant freshness, there is a fullness of mouthfeel and a nuanced gravelly texture."
Syrah,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Polkura,29.0,91.0,"Aromas of graphite, black fruit and herb mark this powerful, forward, extracted Syrah. The palate drills away with tannins and fruit, while the flavors run toward blackberry, herb and earthy spice. Dark and dense on the finish, with licorice and pepper flavors, this is ready to drink now–2014."
Syrah,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,29.0,91.0,"Very rich and jammy, this full-bodied wine grown at 2,500 feet has spicy oak aromas, lavishly ripe blackberry and dried cherry flavors and a mouth-coating texture. Its vanilla, nutmeg and toasted bread aromas meld nicely with all the fruit notes for a complex, showy, wine."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Shaya,29.0,91.0,"Elegant and elevated, this shows fine integration of fruit and oak on the nose. It feels creamy, with barrel toast, dry spice and melon flavors. It is firm, healthy and structured on the finish courtesy of barrel fermentation and aging. A Burgundian facsimile from Rueda."
Dolcetto,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,29.0,91.0,"This wine's bright, fruit-forward raspberry, herb, cocoa and barrel spice aromas are followed by exquisitely pure, elegant red plum flavors that coat the palate from end to end. A delicious rendition of this seldom seen variety."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,29.0,91.0,"High toned aromas mark the nose of this wine, including dried herb, fresh plum, huckleberry and spice. Its purple fruit flavors are rich and lush, with a pleasing purity that carries through the finish. It's uncharacteristic of Sangiovese but brings undeniable appeal."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Siegel,29.0,91.0,"Herbal, briary berry aromas are minty and suggestive of olive. The mouthfeel is plump and juicy, while herbal blackberry and black currant flavors finish with a blast of toast and mint. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah is quintessentially Chilean in aromas, flavors and intensity. Drink through 2020."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,29.0,91.0,"Inviting notes of ripe juicy pear have an earthy pithy tint. The palate shows the same contrast of rich beguiling fruit and earthier pithier elements of bitterness. They work well together and create a harmonious textured picture. The palate is generous, concentrated and finishes off dry."
Sangiovese,US,California,Pianetta,29.0,91.0,"Distinct and delicious aromas of crème brûlée with a strawberry glaze pick up some licorice and dark spice when digging deeper. The cranberry fruit's tartness, tannins, and acidity make for a mouth-rinsing wine. Serve with hearty pasta or rich meats."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot,29.0,91.0,"A short wood-aging has given this wine an extra dimension that's both ripe and ageworthy. Yellow fruits are spiced up by the toast and ginger flavors, whlle intense background acidity provides wonderful freshness. This wine deserves to age. Drink from 2017."
G-S-M,US,Washington,Bontzu,29.0,91.0,"Grenache (60%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest fleshed out by Syrah (28%) and Mourvèdre, all aged in used French puncheons. Expressive fruit aromas offer notes of boysenberry, raspberry, orange peel and spice. The flavors are velvety in feel and linger on the finish."
Grenache,US,Washington,Maison Bleue,29.0,91.0,"This high-acid, intense wine is beautifully aromatic, with piercing and tart flavors of cranberry and raspberry, pure and laced with minerality. Terrific penetration, the persistence of wet stone, citrus, raspberry and cranberry flavors is impressive."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Navarro,29.0,91.0,"Polished and balanced, this masterpiece shows restraint and it's already drinkable. With its great acidity and its fine intermingling of spice and red fruit flavors, this wine will appeal to lovers of Gamay and Pinot Noir."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Tokara,29.0,91.0,"Tropical tones of mango and grilled pineapple are matched with notes of citrus oil and Honeycomb cereal on the nose and mouth of this decadent wine. Ample acidity helps to keep the palate fresh and the mouthfeel lifted, while rich flavors of peach pit and toasted brioche linger long on the close. Drink now–2019."
Sangiovese,US,California,Vino Noceto,29.0,91.0,"Subtle but complex aromas, quietly seductive flavors and a svelte texture characterize this medium-bodied, elegant wine. Everything seems to be in place, with no elbows sticking out, and just enough tannic grip to keep it lively."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,29.0,91.0,"Now entitled to use the expanded Willamette Valley AVA, this estate-grown wine is broad, full-flavored and loaded with fruit. Fresh sliced peaches, papaya and melon flavors abound, and a nice touch of citrus lifts the finish."
Carmenère,Chile,Peumo,Concha y Toro,29.0,91.0,"Berry aromas are followed by a round, wholesomeness that can't be criticized. The palate is unlike many a Carmenère because it eschews the herbal, green element that's inherent to the grape, and instead offers plum, blackberry and all the richness one can conjure. A round, finish of light oak and vanilla seals it all in fine fashion. Surely the most jammy, expressive and pure Carmenère that Chile has to offer."
White Blend,US,New York,Channing Daughters,29.0,91.0,"This field blend of aromatic white varieties intoxicates with its exotic haze of cinnamon, orange peel and turmeric spices. It's lusciously phenolic in mouthfeel, with a deep, penetrating core of dried peach and pear flavors that lingers on and on and on."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Girard,29.0,91.0,"Produced in the typical flinty (silex) soil of parts of Sancerre, this wine has a crisp steely texture that is balanced by the ripe yellow fruit. The combination is both taut and ripe, giving good balance and tension. Drink this wine from 2017 to allow it to develop further."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ousterhout,29.0,91.0,"Dusty in red fruit, like crisp cassis and plum, this is a restrained, elegant and smooth wine from a great site. It shows a complexity of baking spices and cherry compote as it cruises into a lengthy finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Northstar,29.0,91.0,"Stella Maris is priced well below the other Northstar wines, but can stand on its own with this kind of quality. Bursting with tangy berries and lively acidity, it feels sculpted and refreshing, deep and lingering. A lick of mocha and a finishing hint of licorice add to the pleasure."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Alain Jaume et Fils,29.0,91.0,"A perennial winner, Grande Garrigue is a medium- to full-bodied wine with supple tannins and ample cherry fruit. This vintage shows a hint of asphalt upfront, then dark tones of earth and chocolate on the velvety finish. Drink now–2022."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,Steininger,29.0,91.0,"The palest pink fizz exudes notes of tart blackcurrant and aromatic blackcurrant leaf in this rare Cabernet Sauvignon-based sparkling. The palate is light, dry, softly fizzing and ticks all the boxes of an elegant, refreshing traditional-method sparkling wine. The blackcurrant notions are softer on the palate but they echo with every tiny bubble that bursts. This has enough structure to go from apéritif through to food, in fact, creative cooks may find this will chime with their subtle creations."
Riesling,US,California,Claiborne & Churchill,28.0,91.0,"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Dracaena,28.0,91.0,"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,28.0,91.0,"The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrus—think white grapefruit—and melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Cloudy Bay,28.0,91.0,"Classic gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes feature gentle herbal nuances on the nose. There's ample weight and texture on the palate, with a burst of mouthwatering citrus on the finish."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Benvenuto de la Serna,28.0,91.0,"Sweet oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a jammy bouquet that also features black plum and blackberry scents. This blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat feels full, lifted and balanced. Ripe, enticing flavors of wild berry and cassis are backed by toast, chocolate, vanilla and coconut notes as well as heat and burn. Drink through 2019."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Oregon,Francis Tannahill,28.0,91.0,"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,28.0,91.0,"The aromas bring notes of toast, spice and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black, showing the warmth of the vintage and appellation along with their appeal."
Muskat,US,California,Solminer,28.0,91.0,"Bright orange blossoms, tangy lime, fresh rain, quince, green tea, jasmine and even a sesame element shine through on the nose of this bottling that carries a distinctively Asian character. Exotic citrus and brisk melon flavors show on the palate, which is lined with an ethereal undercurrent of bound up, bone-dry energy."
Carignano,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Cantina Santadi,28.0,91.0,"Smooth and delicious, this delivers layers of crushed black cherry, ripe raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and chopped Mediterranean herb. Round, ripe tannins lend it a velvety texture."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Still Waters,28.0,91.0,"Fruity frills of strawberry surround a core of black New Mexican chiles, with cinnamon and clove emerging the longer one sniffs. There's nice tension between the fruit flavors and the nearly bell pepper greenness. Throw a chill on it and serve with barbecued pork."
Syrah,US,Washington,DaMa,28.0,91.0,"This spicy, elegant take on Syrah will reward your attention. Boysenberry and other purple/black fruits are expressed both aromatically and on the palate, with light touches of vanilla. The overall impression is of a pretty, structured, textural wine, with excellent length and balance."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Sleight of Hand,28.0,91.0,"It's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like, but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly. Nuanced with mineral and spice notes, this has melon and apple flavors that seem to sail on a gentle sea breeze. It doesn't slam you with oak, instead it seduces with you style."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Viñas del Cenit,28.0,91.0,"From the Zamora region, this Tempranillo is dark, well oaked and dense. The nose is full of black cherry and charred oak that gives off a shoe polish scent. The palate is round and smooth, with oak-dominated black fruit and minty, spicy flavors. A modern, meaty wine by any measure. Drink now through 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Bertinerie,28.0,91.0,"This rich, concentrated wine is velvet smooth, with tannins enveloped by ripe berry and plum fruits. Wood aging has added to the the rounded character. Despite its approachability, it will age well, so the wine is best drunk from 2018."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Dopff & Irion,28.0,91.0,Apple notes have a lifted ethereal quality. The palate comes in with beautifully poised lemon freshness that counters the just off-dry richness of the fruit flavors. This is balm-like in its apple-focused fruitiness and goes down very easily. Flavors linger.
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Christian Leperchois,28.0,91.0,"Leperchois's wines are almost always interesting. This one, a blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 10% Cinsault, features distinctive green olive and peppercorn aromas alongside cherry fruit. It's silky and elegant on the palate, with a long finish. Drink now–2017."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Dobbes Family Estate,28.0,91.0,"An outstanding value, the latest release of this wine dazzles with bold, black cherry and chocolate mocha flavors. The focus and definition throughout are exceptional also. This is a gem at a more than fair tariff."
White Blend,US,California,M2,28.0,91.0,"This is a rich, fragrant and luscious-tasting dessert wine. Wonderful honey, orange blossom and peach nectar aromas waft from the glass, and concentrated, luxurious, sweet fruit and floral flavors wash over the palate. The mouthfeel is rich and viscous, leaving a long finish that echoes the sweet honey aromas."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Phillips Hill,28.0,91.0,"This has a medium-garnet color, not overly dark, and the aromas are a bit restrained. However, the flavors ring out and range from higher notes of raspberry and cranberry to a bass note of black cherry for a whole octave of fruit. Classic firm acidity and tannins provide textural backbone and the finish, though lean, lingers."
Riesling,US,California,Cutruzzola,28.0,91.0,"Honey-roasted almonds, seared lemon vinaigrette and honeydew melon show on the delicious nose of this off-dry wine from an extreme coastal vineyard above Cambria. Though slightly sweet, it remains rich and intriguing, with lots of citrus peel, grapefruit pith, squeezed oranges and touches of petrol."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),28.0,91.0,"Succulent yellow plums and cherries burst from each sip of this gloriously honeyed Riesling. Semisweet in style, it juxtaposes a densely packed core of stone fruit against dazzling lemon-lime freshness. Layers of mineral, earth and pollen lend nuance to a long, ambling finish. Drink now, but also hold a few bottles back to mature through 2025."
Syrah,US,California,Eberle,28.0,91.0,"Savory aromas of black pepper, teriyaki-glazed steak, charcoal and elderberry jam converge for a compelling nose on this bottling. There is a strong soy richness to the sip, with grilled black plums and alder smoke flavors. It's the perfect barbecue wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Emile Balland,28.0,91.0,"This is the top wine from Balland, who is based in the Coteaux du Giennois further north. Taking its name from the limestone pebbles in the vineyard, it is textured, mineral and zesty. Crisp lemon and warmer green plums give it tautness and add a richer element. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Gitton Père et Fils,28.0,91.0,"Produced on flinty soil and aged in large wood barrels, this is a complex, rich wine. Ample apple and pear flavors are lifted by the smoky flavor and the concentration from aging on lees. The wine needs to age; drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Seghesio,28.0,91.0,"Young, tight, firm fruit, with nuances of blueberry dominating. Tannic, dry and tight, it's well made with excellent structure and balance. Tight right now, high-toned and tart, but with a good, long life ahead."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Solabal,28.0,91.0,"Solabal captures the essence of Rioja reserva with this fairly oaked, fruity wine. The palate is tight and demanding, with proper acid-to-tannin balance. Flavors of wild raspberry and plum are lively, while the finish shows some creaminess, tobacco and warmth. Drink now and over the next two years."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Barrister,28.0,91.0,"The fruit for this excellent Cabernet Franc is sourced from wide-ranging vineyards throughout the Yakima, Columbia and Walla Walla valleys. Aged 18 months in a mix of French, American and Hungarian oak, it is the most accessible of the new red wine releases from Barrister. The tart red fruits are coated with creamy caramel and pretty toast notes, and it sails like clean silk into a long, smooth, buttery finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Alexana,28.0,91.0,"This rosé brings extra levels of finesse and detail along with the expected burst of fresh fruit. Elegant and sophisticated, it offers tart cherry fruit, some peppery herb and a hint of fresh-ground coffee. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it's smooth as silk."
Syrah,US,Oregon,Jaxon,28.0,91.0,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this lightly colored wine brings appealing notes of assorted berries, herbs and barrel spices. It's very pretty in style, soft in feel with a lingering finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Rochemorin,28.0,91.0,"André Lurton bought de Rochemorin in 1973, an estate with vines since the 16th century. This is an aromatic wine, perfumed with blackberry tones. It has plenty of fresh fruit, soft tannins and ample acidity. The structure plays a supporting role—dry while also showing some richness. Drink from 2019."
Roussanne,US,California,Two Moons,28.0,91.0,"An layered nose shows pan-fried apples, caramelized pears, just-ripe banana, roasted chicken and slight quinine aromas. The palate starts tropical and fat, with banana and mango flavors, but settles into a smoked, oaky-apple groove, hinged to steely tension."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,91.0,"Whiffs of sun-burnt slate lend contrast to bright nectarine and citrus peel flavors in this clingy, textured Kabinett. Bristling acidity balances delicate swathes of honey- and nectar-like sweetness that linger on the finish. It's delightfully refreshing, with complexity to linger over."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Elena Walch,28.0,91.0,"Bright and structured, this savory wine opens with intense aromas of crushed tomato vine, gooseberry and hay. The vibrant palate delivers layers of juicy white peach, honeydew melon, lemon and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity. There's so much to enjoy here!"
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Ankal,28.0,91.0,"Oaky aromas of maple, blackberry and chimney grit set up a raw tannic palate. This tastes toasty and oaky, but with enough black-fruit flavor to support all that wood. Mild herb and spice flavors mix with tea and berry notes on the finish of this off-vintage Tempranillo. Drink through 2022."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Staatliche Weinbaudomäne Oppenheim,28.0,91.0,"Crushed minerals and steel reverberate amidst concentrated lime and lemon in this racy, laser-edged Riesling. Dry and taut on the palate, it finishes long with spine tingling acidity and revitalizing tangs of mineral intensity."
Sémillon,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Esporão,28.0,91.0,"This wine, made from 100% Sémillon, is aged in wood and richly endowed. The palate has a smooth texture, with ripe apricot and citrus alongside a hint of a herbs. Drink now."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tertulia,28.0,91.0,"A fine effort, with an inviting swirl of earthy components. Citrus, spice, earth, compost, coffee grounds and cinnamon comprise this detailed, aromatic wine. It sits squarely in the classic mold of the better Walla Walla Syrahs."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Sainte Marguerite,28.0,91.0,"Elegant, taut and poised, this has enough texture to suggest it needs a few more months of aging. It has a finely wrought character that comes from the mix of zesty acidity and sweet fruit."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Richard Rottiers,28.0,91.0,"This is a firm and stony wine, with dry tannins that give structure to the intense acidity and the red cherry flavor. It's dense and concentrated, with a solid feel that demands several years of aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Convergence Zone,28.0,91.0,"A firm and authoritative Bordeaux-style blend, the Squall Line is an equal mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with a splash of Merlot to finish.

Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Cottanera,28.0,91.0,"Aromas of dark berries and black spices lead the nose on this polished red. The concentrated but refined palate delivers crushed raspberries, licorice and mineral notes framed in velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2024."
Fiano,Italy,Southern Italy,Tenuta Sarno 1860,28.0,91.0,"A few swirls of the glass release alluring smoky flint, hazelnut, citrus and dried Mediterranean herb aromas. That savory mineral quality carries over to the bright, tangy palate, underscoring ripe pear, lemon, apple and thyme honey flavors."
Syrah,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,28.0,91.0,"I can see why so many of Washington's winemakers love this young vineyard. It is already expressing the sort of subtleties that most viticulturalists would kill for. The fruit is ripe but not too sweet or jammy. It is annotated with citrus, leaf and stem, along with streaks of smoke and herb and mineral. It's all mixed together seamlessly and focused into a firm, almost muscular style with real authority."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Forgeron,28.0,91.0,"This full-bodied blend of grapes from a wide assortment of top vineyards shows fine acidity, a good phenolic frame of citrus rind, and core flavors of lemon and grapefruit, green apple and white peach. There's a seam of butterscotch also, from aging in one-third new French Burgundian oak barrels."
Chenin Blanc,US,New York,Paumanok,28.0,91.0,"Zesty acidity and an enticing slick of honeycomb lend varietal character to this lavishly floral, peachy white. So spry and revitalizing, with a salty tang of minerality, it's surprisingly still the only Chenin Blanc grown in New York."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,91.0,"Chalk dust and slate lend a mineral elegance to white blossom, lime and gooseberry notes. The palate is zesty and spry, marked by concentrated hits of sweet stone fruit and citrus flavor."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Schloss Saarstein,28.0,91.0,"White peach, melon and lime flavors are pure and pristine. A kiss of honey sweetens the palate, lingering softly alongside a spritz of lemony acidity. Enjoy now through 2016 for its crystalline character."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Celler Bàrbara Forés,28.0,91.0,"Immediately you'll note that this is light and airy, with floral aromas and touches of cinnamon dust and leather. The blend is 70% Morenillo, an obscure Catalan variety, and Garnacha. The palate is fresh and lithe, while bright raspberry, herb and spice flavors finish in whole, integrated fashion. Drink through 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),28.0,91.0,"Crisp green plum and gooseberry aromas lend an invitingly cool touch to this otherwise sun-kissed spätlese. The palate is delicately honeyed, showcasing a bounty of sweet, succulent apricot, tangerine and pink grapefruit flavors. Spry texture and a spine tingling acidic backbone lend impeccable balance."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,28.0,91.0,"Freshly milled white pepper and lemon zest are inviting on the nose. Spice and lemony freshness continue on the palate where they are joined by riper fruit notes of yellow and red apples, always keeping that refreshing and lively zing."
Red Blend,France,France Other,Clos Venturi,28.0,91.0,"This ripe, rich wine is full of fruit. Sweet tannins have merged with the blackberry fruits, making it structured and dense. Spice, balancing acidity and a dark, firm aftertaste all promise further aging. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Cadence,28.0,91.0,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (38%), Cabernet Franc (33%), Merlot (20%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of earth, herb, flowers and red and black fruit are followed by well-proportioned dark-fruit flavors that show a lot of structure. It's a great introduction to the house style."
Carignane,US,California,Carol Shelton,28.0,91.0,"This wine succeeds in showing ripe, robust and even slightly rustic fruit flavor within a complex, integrated mix of tannin and oak. Dried cherry, chocolate and nutmeg accent a succulent backbone of juicy acidity and likable texture. The vines are 60-plus-years old."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Lieubeau,28.0,91.0,"From a parcel of vines at Château de l'Aulnaye in the Château-Thébaud area, this is now a mature, ripe and smooth wine, It has a flinty edge along with richer yellow fruits and mint. This concentrated wine is ready to drink."
White Blend,US,Washington,McCrea,28.0,91.0,"The blend is 37% Marsanne, 33% Grenache Blanc, 20% Picpoul and 10% Roussanne. Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. The stony, textural underpinning adds a lot of depth while the fruit mixes citrus and melon with hints of just-ripe green banana and papaya. It's a juicy yet subtle wine, with aging potential over the next half decade or so."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Montes,28.0,91.0,"Aromas of cocoa, cassis and marshmallow are sweet and attractive, while the palate feels just right and tastes of cassis, plum, caramel and pepper. While it is powerful, it's not a runaway tank. Thus expect a sly finish that's toasty, dark and polite. Drink now and over the next couple of years. Very good Cab from one of Chile's top producers."
Chardonnay,US,California,Morgan,28.0,91.0,"Fresh and approachable but lean and focused on the nose, this wine shows chalk, wet slate, iodine and mandarin orange oil aromas. It's extremely limey and quinine-driven on the tangy palate, with the judicious acidity of squeezed lime and tangerine juice."
Roussanne,US,California,Zinke,28.0,91.0,"Coming from the relatively new but priming Kimsey Vineyard, this shows intoxicatingly rich yet never treacly aromas of ripe cantaloupe, ambrosia melon and peach-apple syrup. Glazed apples, walnut oil and orange bitters decorate the heavily layered and dense palate. Serve it with many varieties of cheese."
Roussanne,US,California,Stolpman,28.0,91.0,"Warm aromas of lemon preserves, smoked honeysuckle and lightly honeyed Marcona almonds are cut with a citrus freshness on the nose of this estate-grown wine. A citrus-blossom character starts the sip followed by rounded saltiness and apple-flesh flavor in the midpalate. It's altogether very luscious and yet enlivening to the mouth."
Grenache-Syrah,US,California,2Plank,28.0,91.0,"Blackberry, violets, gingerbread, cola and cedar show on the great nose of this blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah from the Fallbrook area north of San Diego. Complex flavors of incense and juniper spice up the backbone of blueberry and black plum, with a beef char component adding to the savory side."
Chardonnay,US,California,Breggo,28.0,91.0,"This is a cool-climate Chardonnay that's dark gold in color and tastes of ripe apple. From both the Ferrington and Savoy Vineyards, two of Anderson Valley's finest, it shows the greatness of the vintage in coastal Mendocino. Fragrant and rich in honey and toasty notes, it finishes crisp. Crab cakes with it would be ideal."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Sinclair Estate Vineyards,28.0,91.0,"The aromas of lees, citrus, almond, melon, apple, spice and butter draw you into the glass. This wine brings a dazzling sense of texture, with fruit and spice flavors dappled throughout."
Chardonnay,US,Michigan,Bel Lago,28.0,91.0,"Incredibly pure and pristine on the nose, notes of citrus cream, sea spray and white flowers hover over a base of white peach in this northern Michigan Chardonnay. With two years in French oak (25% new) and extended lees aging, the palate is round and sultry, boasting lightly brûléed lemon and zesty mineral notes that build to toasted hazelnut. A preserved-lemon finish lingers and leaves the palate wanting more. In time, the acidity will soften and this wine will truly sing. Drink now–2018."
Merlot,US,Washington,Bergevin Lane,28.0,91.0,"Here is the best of the current red wine releases from Bergevin Lane, a Merlot blend that includes 5% of each Petit Verdot and Malbec. Dense and potent, it's loaded with black fruits, coffee and tobacco flavors. The wine is wonderfully rich, with excellent definition and body. Drink now or cellar for another decade."
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Wohlmuth,28.0,91.0,"The seductive, aromatic lift of elderberry and blackberry give way to notes of dark chocolate and plum in this blend of Blaufränkisch and Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate is like a highly pixillated, sharp image of the finest, ripest fruit, with its tight, fine and polished tannins supported by the sonorous tone of oak."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,28.0,91.0,"Scents of crushed tomato stalk and green onion make a big impression upfront, but they're balanced by stone fruit and pineapple flavors. This is rich and ripe in the mouth, showing great power and persistence on the finish. Drink now."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Finca Anzil,28.0,91.0,"Licorice, leather, char and an overload of plum and berries are what greet you, and that's just the bouquet. In the mouth, this is thick, bruising stuff; the tannins are drawing and very tight, but the flavors of licorice, blackberry and chocolate are excellent. Finishes rock solid, which is to be expected given the wine's total package. If you can, hold until 2011 to let the tannins soften; it's meant for the cellar."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Sinclair Estate Vineyards,28.0,91.0,"Young and still integrating its lush barrel flavors, this savory Chardonnay should hit its peak in another two or three years. The fruit is full and fleshy, a generous mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits. Creamy and nicely textural in the mouth, it has the grip and acidity to keep it poised and detailed through a long finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,28.0,91.0,"A fine bottle — full, fleshy, immediately throwing out dense aromatics with toast and roasted coffee and bitter chocolate components. A deep vein of black cherry and cassis keeps the core tight and focused, and a small splash of Syrah adds the scent of black pepper."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Prats & Symington LDA,28.0,91.0,"This is the latest vintage of the second wine produced by the joint venture between the Symington Family and Bruno Prats from Bordeaux. While the wine has plenty of wood, it also has the potential of ripe blackberry fruits. It is rich, full of ripe tannins and toast from the wood. Nutmeg and cinnamon add interest. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,River's Edge,28.0,91.0,"The winery produces two outstanding Pinots from estate vineyards planted in 1972. This is big and chewy (as the potent alcohol might suggest) and aging in 50% new French oak puts flavors of toasted coconut and caramel around smooth supple cherry fruit. There's a finishing hint of eucalyptus; all in all, it's a terrific value and a truly original take on Pinot Noir."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello d'Albola,28.0,91.0,"Alluring scents of chopped mint, ripe berry, new leather, clove and a floral note all come together on this elegantly structured wine. The taut palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, fresh herb and dark baking spice while polished tannins provide structure. Drink 2017–2022."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Carpineta Fontalpino,28.0,91.0,"Enticing scents of violet, iris, perfumed red berry and a whiff of cake spice emerge on this vibrant red. The chewy, savory palate has good concentration for the vintage, offering black cherry, ground pepper, clove and licorice. Firm, mature tannins and vibrant acidity provide balance while a mint note backs up the finish."
Tempranillo,US,Oregon,Willful,28.0,91.0,"Toasty, dense and tannic, this combines blueberry fruit, roasted walnut and sappy acidity in a fresh, youthful and delicious wine. Drink now through 2022."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Willi Haag,28.0,91.0,"This wine's aromas of baked apple, honey, cinnamon and brown sugar are immediately attractive, and in the mouth it doesn't disappoint. It's broad and mouthfilling but avoids heaviness, finishing long, with hints of orange rind."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Bell,28.0,91.0,"Ah, this is a wonderfully dry and bracing wine that avid wine drinkers will appreciate for its great balance, sense of reserve and mouthwatering quality. The aromas and flavors are like cucumber, grapefruit and white pepper, the acidity is almost electric and the finish lingering."
Chardonnay,US,California,Alma Rosa,28.0,91.0,"Very tight and Chablis-like in style, this bottling from Richard and Thekla Sanford shows crisp Asian pear, lemon pith, Pink Lady apple rinds, wet concrete and a touch of petrol on the nose. The palate is light and fresh, with yellow pear, nectarine and a lemon skin-led acidity, possessing all the bones to age with style."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Tejo,Fiuza,28.0,91.0,"This powerful, ripe wine is a delicious testament to the structured qualities of the Alicante Bouschet. It is rich and dense, with juicy blackberry flavors and dark tannins. With the wood aging smoothing out the wrinkles, the wine is impressive. Drink from 2017."
Port,Portugal,Port,Quinta de la Rosa,28.0,91.0,"The wine is rich and spicy with layers of dried raisin and prune flavors along with a light touch of acidity. Its ripe fruit is tempered by the bite of spirit that gives the wine a lift as well as adding extra richness. On the dry side of Ports, it is made to be drunk now."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Antiquum Farm,28.0,91.0,"This unusual rosé is all Pinot Gris, picked for thick skins, chewy tannins, high acidity, and given a 36-hour cold soak prior to fermentation. It's a pale salmon/copper shade, full-bodied and juicy, with fruit flavors of peach and citrus. Highlights of hibiscus tea and floral aromatics contribute further complexity."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Terrabianca,28.0,91.0,"Fragrant purple flower aromas, with red berry and vanilla lead the nose of this round, succulent wine. Notes of mocha, white pepper and aniseed accent the juicy black cherry core while chewy tannins provide the framework."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,28.0,91.0,The stupidly heavy bottle is off-putting. That's a shame as the wine itself is ripe and impressive. Rich lemon and pear fruits go with touches of wood spice and a mineral texture. They blend well in a full and generous wine that is now ready to drink.
Grenache,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,28.0,91.0,"The oak (50% new French) plays a big part in this show, with aromas of coffee and pencil lead alongside the variety's strawberries and herbs. It's supple and pillowy in feel with a high yum factor."
Riesling,US,California,Pey-Marin,28.0,91.0,"In this distinctive, delicate, dry Riesling, the signature aromas of pine, petrol and white peach lead to crisp, tangy, green apple and peach skin flavors that tingle the taste buds. It's light bodied, lean in texture and makes the mouth water."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,O•S Winery,28.0,91.0,"This is an especially fine version of this single-vineyard Cabernet Franc; sadly, it may be awhile before we see it again as the vineyard suffered severe damage in 2011. Loaded with pure, rich cherry fruit, it adds layers of graphite, cedar and coffee over a mineral base."
Syrah,US,Washington,Savage Grace,28.0,91.0,"This wine comes from three-year-old vines at this esteemed vineyard. Lighter in color, it has aromas that pop and are very primary, with notes of boysenberry, raspberry and herb. Lighter in style, the flavors are pure and direct, showing no new oak influence (neutral barrels for four months) and an appealing feel. The purity is dazzling. It impresses on its own but is meant to be shown at the dinner table."
Chardonnay,US,California,Zaca Mesa,28.0,91.0,"Light and subtle yet distinct aromas of pineapple meet with crushed white rocks on the nose of this bottling. Pineapple juice flavors also arise on the palate, with is lean and crisp with touches of ripe lemon and pear flesh."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Niepoort,28.0,91.0,"This wine is rich, smooth and full of black currant fruits. It has a dense texture although the acidity suggests a crisper side. It will age relatively quickly, giving a fruity wine that has layers of acidity."
Chardonnay,US,California,FEL,28.0,91.0,"For a change of pace, this almost electric wine instantly energizes the taste buds. Aromas recall kiwi fruit and fresh-cut pears. The texture is lively, fresh and pure, with good acid balance and a lingering, tangy finish. Pair it with simple preparations of fish and shellfish."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,San Martino,28.0,91.0,"Here's a robust wine that opens with aromas of blue flower, earth, black fruit and a whiff of new leather. The juicy palate delivers ripe black cherry, mature raspberry, black pepper and balsamic herb, all supported by a firm, tannic backbone. Hold for additional complexity; best from 2016–2026."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Sleight of Hand,28.0,91.0,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and 34% Cabernet Franc. Some 20% saw new French oak, and the wine has lovely concentration and flavor integration. Blueberry, blackberry and cassis are wrapped in cacao and coffee—thoroughly luscious and nicely concentrated."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,91.0,"More blossomy and mineral than ripe or ruddy, there's a demure elegance to this bristling off-dry Riesling. Crisp, almost crystalline flavors of tangerine and yellow peach accentuate and lengthen the palate. It's a deftly cutting wine to drink now through 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Vinho da Mesa,Messias,28.0,91.0,"With fruit from three Portuguese regions including Dâo and Douro, this herbal and mint- dominated wine is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah. It has elegance, a touch of spice from wood, sweet juicy damson fruits and a lingering finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,91.0,"There's a revitalizing swathe of herbs on the nose of this medium-sweet Riesling, highlighting notes of lemon and lime against a backdrop of juicy, ripe yellow peaches and nectarines. It's delicately lacy on the palate, yet bolstered by tones of honey and wax. A citrus acidity that pierces long on the finish."
Syrah,US,California,Baker Lane,28.0,91.0,"A light-bodied take on the variety, this wine imparts shocks of sage, lavender and mint aromas over a landscape of black and white pepper and dried herb flavors."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stadt Krems,28.0,91.0,"Ripe, rounded green pear flavors gain edge from peppery, herbal notes and the verve of zesty lemon acidity. The conference pear flavors shine through to the very end to provide zesty, savory pleasure."
Merlot,US,New York,Paumanok,28.0,91.0,"Paumanok's standard-label 2013 Merlot shares much of the same ripe ruddy fruit intensity of the Grand Vintage bottling. Lighter in body and a touch crisper on the palate, it's an elegant and nuanced yet more approachable wine. Taut with tannins and still tightly wound, it will still benefit from cellaring through 2022."
Viognier,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,28.0,91.0,"Smooth and silky, this lovely Viognier begins with flavors of citrus, lemongrass and fresh herb, before continuing into a well-rounded, full-flavored midpalate that hints at just a touch of residual sugar."
Merlot,US,Washington,Basel Cellars,28.0,91.0,"It's 100% Merlot, and it doesn't need any help from any other grapes. Extremely dark and thick in the mouth, this liquorous bruiser of a Merlot is thoroughly delicious. It's just packed with fruit, cassis and ripe black cherries, complemented by dark chocolate notes."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,28.0,91.0,"Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon share top billing here, in a sleek, stylish, beautifully polished wine loaded with blackberries, black cherries and cassis. Firm and textural, it layers in subtle spices, dark chocolate, espresso and moist loam, all in delicate balance. The firmness of the tannins and tightness of the layering suggests that laying it down for a few years will only improve it further."
Syrah,US,Washington,Amavi,28.0,91.0,"Fragrant with pretty berry scents, this compact wine rewards some hours of breathing time. The tangy fruit is complemented by streaks of herb, mineral and citrus peel, all woven together into a gently fading finish that adds a lick of dark chocolate."
Merlot,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,28.0,91.0,"Reserve caliber fruit—a throat-coating mix of blueberry, cherry and cassis—rolls into a rich, full throttle wash of barrel flavors. Toast, smoke, espresso and dark chocolate give the wine depth and gravitas. Ageworthy to be sure, but also enjoyable right now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Zenaida Cellars,28.0,91.0,"Powerful and elegant aromas of tobacco, dark herbs, cedar and a touch of green pepper keep the nose entertained for quite a while. There's a peppery, meaty character to the palate, with purple fruits arising over time. This one will be even better in a few years."
Barbera,US,California,Tamás Estates,28.0,91.0,"A charmingly seductive small lot from Tamas, a sister brand of Wente in the Livermore Valley. The wine has tremendous aromas of violet and oak that evolve into blackberry and cherry flavors, all dry and elegant at the end. Made from 88% Barbera and 12% Petite Sirah, serve this one with grilled meat."
Marsanne,Australia,Victoria,Ben Haines,28.0,91.0,"Yarra Valley isn't really where you'd expect to find Marsanne, so this entirely barrel-fermented example is a treat. Only 10% new oak is used, just enough to lend a subtle note of toasted hazelnuts to the fruit, imparting silky texture and added complexity to the white peach, fig and melon flavors on the medium-bodied palate. Finishes long and citrusy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Columbia Winery,28.0,91.0,"A fine Otis Cab, from Columbia's now departed winemaking team of David Lake and Robert Takahashi. It's rich and deep, scented with a luscious mix of fresh herbs. The fruit has a pleasing spiciness, sweet plum and cassis threaded with anise and sage. There seems to be more fruit concentration and less of the green, peppery character that Otis can bring in some vintages, but even now this is a very young wine (it was released in June of 2008) that should reward another few years of cellaring."
Tempranillo,US,California,Irwin Family Vineyards,28.0,91.0,"This bold, mouthfilling wine was aged in large-format barrels, helping make it polished and relaxed in texture. Aromas and flavors are ripe and inviting, like blackberries and black cherries, while the mouthfeel is well supported by fine-grained tannins."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg,28.0,91.0,"This is a rich and full-flavored wine that still has plenty of aging ahead of it. It has a very floral character that is followed by green fruit and spice, and sustained by a tight, steely texture. Drink from 2016."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,28.0,91.0,"A new style and blend from Tamarack, Spicebox mixes Grenache from Weinbau, Counoise from Ciel du Cheval, and Syrah from Sagemoor. It's aged in neutral barrels, putting the emphasis on flavors of grape, root and leaf. Raspberries, minerals and tart acids are in play, in an elegant and ageworthy red."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère,Chile,Maipo Valley,Viña el Principal,28.0,91.0,"Olive and herb aromas suggest juniper along with baked plum and berry. This is a muscular, saturated blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère that offers roasted, savory, saucy berry flavors in front of a toasty, coffee-driven finish. Drink through 2020."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Radda,28.0,91.0,"Underbrush, tilled earth, leather, ripe berry and a whiff of baking spice aromas meld together on this fragrant wine. The savory, refined palate offers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a tobacco note framed in firm, polished tannins. Drink through 2020."
Red Blend,France,France Other,Henri Milan,28.0,91.0,"A rich wine, perfumed and intense. The tannins are a major element, although they ride with the sweet fruit and concentrated, complex wood and acidity. The wine is firm, impressively fruity and still likely to age further."
Viura,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Murrieta,28.0,91.0,"There are wines with mass appeal and others that are so idiosyncratic that only one in five people might like it. This falls into the latter category; it's barrel-fermented Viura with Sherry, dry wood, butterscotch and corn cake aromas. The mouth is creamy and resiny, with integrated acidity that keeps it afloat. Flavors of spiced pear, vanilla, cinnamon and toffee suggest amontillado Sherry and something elusive yet refined. Drink now with a rich seafood dish like lobster or baked turbot."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Nodland,28.0,91.0,"All six Bordeaux varieties are incorporated here, half being Cabernet Sauvignon from Walla Walla's Pepperbridge vineyard. A smooth entry brings up a flavorful mix of ripe strawberry, red plum and black cherry fruits. The wine is somewhat liquorous, with the alcohol showing in a finish tasting of Bourbon-soaked cherries."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Camaraderie,28.0,91.0,"Dark and smoky, with superconcentrated black fruits, this also displays notes of black olive, char and earth. The bright, clean, pure fruit shines through the darker elements, giving the wine balance and a touch of elegance."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Salomon-Undhof,28.0,91.0,This wine balances ripeness with crispness. There is a spice note as well as a smooth texture that will round out further as the wine develops over the next four years..
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,28.0,91.0,Whiffs of honeydew rind and white blossom lend freshness to this light-footed Riesling. It's juicy and sweet with pristine stone fruit and citrus flavors yet revitalizing and spry. Hints of earth and bee pollen lend complexity to the finish.
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Buttonwood,28.0,91.0,"A bright touch of candied strawberry shows prominently on the nose of this bottling, with judicious hints of roasted red pepper, herb and peppercorn hiding behind that vivacious veil. The palate is light in body but has plenty of structure to hold up its cranberry and strawberry flavors and peppery spice. Great with a slight chill."
G-S-M,Australia,South Australia,Yangarra Estate Vineyard,28.0,91.0,"Full bodied and richly tannic, this gives lie to the notion that all Grenache-based blends are easy quaffers. Dried spices and mixed berries include hints of clove and cracked pepper, finishing with some dry, chewy tannins. The assemblage is 49% Grenache, 29% Shiraz and 22% Mourvèdre. Drink 2020–2030."
Graciano,US,California,Quinta Cruz,28.0,91.0,"A Spanish grape variety produced this temptingly smooth, polished but earthy-flavored wine. It smells like new leather, seems young and still leesy and tastes deliciously fruity and supple. A bit decadent, it carries a long finish."
Rosé,US,Washington,Doyenne,28.0,91.0,"The color of a vibrant sunset, it's composed of 55% Grenache, 39% Mourvèdre, and 6% Cinsault. The lush and layered fruit flavors move from ripe summer strawberries into a mineral-drenched fruit salad."
Merlot,US,Washington,Seven Hills,28.0,91.0,"Smooth and palate-coating, it's 100% varietal, with just the right balance between blackberry and black cherry fruit, and barrel-induced flavors of toffee, toasted macadamia nuts, and café crème."
Viognier,US,Washington,Mark Ryan,28.0,91.0,"This satiny, slightly waxy Viognier is a blend from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Olsen fruit; for the first time, roughly 10% was fermented in a concrete egg. Aromatic with yellow apples, lemon curd, bee pollen and floral highlights, it's underscored with a lick of wet stone."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Ciabot Berton,28.0,91.0,"Ripe blackberry, mature plum, rose and grilled herb aromas lead the nose. The savory, approachable palate offers dark cherry, crushed raspberry, aromatic herb, ground anise and a hint of mocha. Firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity give it balance. This will make fine drinking over the next few years. Drink through 2016–2021."
Syrah,US,California,Skinner,28.0,91.0,"A crazy-good combo of lavender, espresso and baking spice flavors make this full-bodied wine fascinating to taste. It's deeply colored, aromatic and tannic, but not heavy. The wine has a vivid stamp of spicy oak, with enough lavish blackberry and black cherry behind it for balance."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,28.0,91.0,"Entirely fermented in neutral puncheons, this new release shows some extra depth and roundness, with a clean, leesy and mineral underpinning. Fresh cut pear and a hint of orange peel highlight the core fruit flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Anaba,28.0,91.0,"Aromatically muted at first, the bouquet opens up with time to reveal steely, finessed notes of pear and fresh citrus that continue through to the palate. The oak is subtle and well-managed, and the minerality alive and fresh."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Laurent Gauthier,28.0,91.0,"A powerful and concentrated wine that has solid tannins and a tight, firm structure. It comes from heavily granitic soil, giving a steely texture that will take time to soften. As the red cherry and plum flavors develop, it will broaden out impressively. Drink from 2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,B Side,28.0,91.0,"This wine over-delivers in quality for the price. It's made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc blended in to good effect. The whole combines into layers of chocolate and graham cracker, dappled in vanilla and jam. Thick tannins suggest a swirl or two of the glass. The finish is all tobacco."
White Blend,US,California,Donkey & Goat,28.0,91.0,"Be prepared for a murky visual in this unusual, concentrated and complex wine. The appearance is hazy and the color brassy, but the flavors are vivid, fresh and bracing. The mouthfeel has great acidity, an unusually thick texture and fine tannins. A sense of layering and intensity develops with more sips, and lingers on the finish."
St. Laurent,Austria,Burgenland,Rosenhof,28.0,91.0,Fleshy red cherry notes dominate this wine's nose and palate. An edge of smoke adds aroamtic complexity to the fluid and fresh flavors. It's juicy and generous with a welcome counterpoint of supple tannins that lend structure to all the cherry fruit.
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Paarl,Graham Beck,28.0,91.0,"A ripe and forward style with upfront notes of pineapple, softly-grilled peach, juicy melon and a touch of spice. The mouthfeel is round and rich, but with enough acidic cut to keep the palate fresh and lively through the long finish. Flavors of sweet orange citrus and ripe green fig linger endlessly."
Riesling,US,California,Solminer,28.0,91.0,"Ripe aromas of honeydew are cut down the middle with a pointed petrol note as well as lime skins and grapefruit pith. The palate on this bottling from popular Riesling source Kick-On Ranch is wound up very tight, showing lime skins, focused acidity and a gray-rock minerality. This would go great with shellfish now, or continue to emerge and uncurl in the cellar from 2018–2030."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,28.0,91.0,"This is a well-crafted wine that's dense and delicious in juicy red fruit, black currant, licorice and nutmeg. With much of the fruit sourced from the Alexander Valley, this wine shows a managed level of ripeness and oak aging. Structured and lengthy on the finish, this is a nicely put-together package."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Lieubeau,28.0,91.0,"From the Château d'Aulnaye vineyard that is part of the Thébaud estate, this wine is still tight and textured, with a strong mineral element as well as crisp green fruits. It is rich with a touch of vanilla smoothing things out. Drink now."
Viognier,US,Washington,Abeja,28.0,91.0,"This much-sought-after, estate-grown Viognier is in short supply in 2011, but it's exemplary for its structure and class. Flavors of lime skin and grapefruit, wet stone and citrus abound. The cool vintage led to low yields—under two tons per acre. All neutral oak was used."
Merlot,US,Washington,Hestia Cellars,28.0,91.0,"This is pure Merlot from the StoneTree vineyard in the Wahluke Slope AVA. It's been aged almost two years in new French oak barrels, and has the delicious mix of fruit and barrel flavors to prove it. Supple, succulent, smooth and spicy, it's a showcase for cherry and cassis fruit, accented with pungent, almost piney herb. Excellent texture and mass shows good winemaking."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Recoletas,28.0,91.0,"Comes on solid and strong with smoky aromas of black fruit, coconut and shoe polish. Stout and layered in the mouth, with full tannins and a nice mix of bold berry flavors, tobacco, herbs, spice and lemony oak. Tastes similar on the finish, with tobacco and spice lasting the longest. Complex and healthy; drink now through 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sarah's Vineyard,28.0,91.0,"Fresh dill, dewy herbs and a seared lemon-syrup scent makes for a dense but not treacly nose on this wine by a producer on the fringes of Gilroy. A chive accent holds attention once sipped, with a chalky minerality and a white-pepper finish, altogether proving brisk and elegant."
Tempranillo,US,Oregon,Jaxon,28.0,91.0,"Add Jaxon to the growing list of Southern Oregon wineries making exceptional Tempranillo. Plump and polished fruit flavors emphasize huckleberry, plum and black cherry. The aging for 21 months in French oak (one new barrel out of six) adds nuances of toasted walnuts, smoke and butterscotch. This is one of those surprising bottles that you just can't stop hitting on."
Dolcetto,Italy,Piedmont,Poderi Luigi Einaudi,28.0,91.0,"Aromas of black cherry, ground cooking spice and a whiff of grilled herb drive the nose on this structured red. The enveloping palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice, almond and black pepper accompanied by firm, velvety tannins."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Bodegas Carchelo,28.0,91.0,"Big and lush, this has graphite, coconut, minty oak and huge berry fruit aromas. It's plush in the mouth but not wayward or overly big, with roasted plum, ­molasses, leather and raspberry flavors and a forward barrel note. Savory and long on the finish, this is a blend of 40% Monastrell, 30% Tempranillo and 15% each Syrah and Cabernet."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Weninger,28.0,91.0,"Savory, smoky glints reach the nose even before the black cherry fruit does. On the palate these flavors are more united and show more depth. The tannins still have the crunchy grip of starched velvet and the freshness at the core is highlighting and welcome. Beautiful balance, grip and tone. Crunchy now but even better as of 2016."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Elgin,Neil Ellis,28.0,91.0,"This is lush and toasty upfront, with supporting aromas of honeydew, peach marmalade and yellow apple. The palate offers ample acidity to lift the rich fruit flavors, while hints of sweet spice, apple skin and toasted brioche unfold on the finish. Attractive and well balanced; enjoy now."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,28.0,91.0,"Pinot Gris has been a Lange highlight since the winery was founded in 1987. Fermented in neutral puncheons, this is a distinctive, focused wine, with pretty pear, spicy apple and a touch of citrus. The puncheons add a light hint of vanilla cookie."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Monte Smith,28.0,91.0,"This is made from a cool vineyard site, low in elevation and often covered in fog. The wine is sultry and velvety, with a smoky edge wrapped in candied cherry and cinnamon. It's overdelivers in terms of price as well."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,River's Edge,28.0,91.0,"Sourced from vines planted in 1972, this saw 50% new French oak. Despite the high alcohol and generous oak, the wine is neither overblown, nor tasting heavily of barrel. Strawberries, white pepper, a dash of minerality and a streak of vanilla all wrap together in a complex wine with a generous finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Gary Farrell,28.0,91.0,"A light, refreshing and yet complex combination of fresh-cut grapefruit and watermelon, a suggestion of apricot and cranberry in the wings, this wine is stellar in every way. Fermented in both stainless steel and neutral oak it provides a textured acidity that gives it balance and just enough weight, finishing with a taste of wet stone."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Labruyère,28.0,91.0,"This is a rich cru wine with red-plum flavors as well as tannins that are still young and forceful. Densely textured, the wine has plenty of potential. It will become a ripe and fruity wine while also remaining firm and structured. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Ektimo Vineyards,28.0,91.0,"While this wine allows plenty of room for ripe voluptuousness, it opens in a light, sublime sense of green apple and lime zest, with a nice tension of acidity on the balanced palate. A slight hint of ginger and lemongrass tease in the background."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Provence,Domaine d'Eole,28.0,91.0,"Richer and deeper than the 2004 version, this shows an abundance of black cherry fruit, but also layers of spicy, savory complexity. Dominated by old-vine Grenache, it could easily be mistaken for a Lirac or Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Drink now–2015."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Derby,28.0,91.0,"Named for the vineyard's address on Live Oak Road, this tasty blend holds 39% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 19% Counoise and 14% Mourvèdre. It delivers aromas of scarlet red rose petals, crushed clove and cherry pie. The fruit flavors are so deep they border on blueberry, set against a tannic backbone, yet proving quite light and drinkable."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ridge,28.0,91.0,"Deliciously ripe and generous, this full-bodied Zin has plenty to like: ripe blackberry, black cherry and baking spice aromas. Deep flavors echo the fruit and layer it with hints of vanilla and nutmeg. While full-bodied and nicely thick in texture, it's not over the top and remains balanced by firm acidity and welcome tannins."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Abad Dom Bueno,28.0,91.0,"This is dry, earthy and complex on the nose, with smooth tannins, elegance and acidic lift to the palate. Flavors of fine oak, copious spice and complex berry are more than satisfying, while the finish is long, dry and composed, featuring a note of cinnamon."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Sheldon,28.0,91.0,"A complex, dark-cherry-flavored Petite Sirah, this is marked by bright fruit and tame tannins, giving the wine a mouthwatering vibrancy. Intense but full of life, bottle aging has helped this wine, as it often does with a variety like Petite Sirah, which can be overwhelming when young. In this case, the years have opened it up, lending an elegance that makes the wine ideal for meaty foods."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Gorman,28.0,91.0,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (44%), Cabernet Sauvignon (34%), Malbec (17%), Cabernet Franc (3%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas are brooding, with notes of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, cherry, herb and spice. The dark-fruit flavors are full bodied, rich and saturated, packing a hefty punch with a finish that sails."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Donkey & Goat,28.0,91.0,"A vivid peach color telegraphs that this is not your ordinary Pinot Gris. The wine smells like peach skin and prosciutto, and is light bodied but steeped in exotic flavors of dried flowers, apricot and sea salt. It has a firm mouthfeel, noticeable astringency and an almost meaty character. It's not for the faint of heart, but fascinating."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Hyland,28.0,91.0,"This solid, fruity, generous wine pushes bold flavors of white peach and melon into a rich midpalate. Highlights of lemon verbena and hints of mint accompany the expected floral scents and lightly soapy character of this distinctive grape. Drink this over the next two years while its freshness is at its best."
Syrah,US,California,Waxwing,28.0,91.0,"Smoky bacon and black pepper layer over generous yet smooth tannins, making for a somewhat didactic, intriguing wine, 100% varietal and aged almost a year in once-used French oak. Medium-bodied with an elegance of texture, it cries to be paired with meat."
Zinfandel,US,California,Eberle,28.0,91.0,"Made with grapes from the Steinbeck, Wine-Bush and Cocavin vineyards, this Zin is packed full of baking spice, dark strawberries, smoked beef, black pepper and gingerbread on the rich, inviting nose. The palate shows a tad more restraint, but offers juicy black plum, rounded cola, dried thyme, peppercorn and pencil lead flavors."
Viognier,US,California,Fess Parker,28.0,91.0,"This refreshing and crisply designed Viognier conveys restrained aromas of white peach and vanilla. The palate shows yellow melon and creamy peach, but with a razor-sharp edge of acidity and a compelling chalky texture. The acid sizzles into the finish."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Bodegas Aquitania,28.0,91.0,"This blends modesty with clarity, and the end result is excellent. Crisp and minerally at all check points, the palate is juicy and citric, but with good body. Citrus, mango, melon and green-fruit flavors drive the palate into a cleansing, finely cut finish."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Louis Guntrum,28.0,91.0,"Dusty, earthy, soil and mineral notes lend complexity to sprightly lemon and honey aromas on this sweet, concentrated Riesling. The palate reverberates with tangy citrus flavors that cap off on a lingering kiss of honeysuckle."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,Prinz Salm,28.0,91.0,"This plump, succulent spätlese starts off with apple and citrus aromas, then delivers intensely mineral flavors reminiscent of crushed vitamins and green apples. Crisp and citrusy on the finish, with a fine sense of poise and balance."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Avennia,28.0,91.0,"A blend of fruit from esteemed Boushey and Red Willow vineyards, this was aged in a mixture of concrete and French oak (10% new). The herb, lemon verbana and citrus flavors are light on their feet with a creamy texture and a tart zing of mouthwatering acidity that stitches it all together."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Tecedeiras,28.0,91.0,"A fine, balanced wine that brings out good toastiness alongside sweet, ripe fruit. Well made, showing good balance, with acidity giving a lift to all the richness. The aftertaste is rounded and delicious."
Barbera,US,California,Andis,28.0,91.0,"With 20% Petite Sirah blended in, Andis's Barbera is juicy, balanced and perfumey. It's a beautiful wine with cranberry, vanilla and cherry aromas and flavors. Pair with your favorite pasta, pizza or grilled meats."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Sinclair Estate Vineyards,28.0,91.0,"Very much in line with SEV's fine 2009 Chardonnay, this is sourced from the Lewis Vineyard. Instantly round and fruity, it offers up a ripe mix of oranges and apricots, backed with juicy acidity. Then it brings in the butter, toast and nuts—a full-bodied, extremely generous wine."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Calera,28.0,91.0,"From six vineyards across the Central Coast, Josh Jensen's annual cuvée shows black cherry, cola and nutmeg on the straight-ahead nose. Solid herbal backbone shows on the sip, with juniper, bay leaf and pine needles giving tang to the sour cranberry fruit. A menthol character carries in to the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Phantom Rivers,28.0,91.0,"This boisterous Pinot Noir offers heavy cedar, raspberry liqueur, cola syrup and Kahlua aromas. Bright red fruit flavors of strawberry pie are rich and mouth-coating like a fine brandy, but remain soft and tasty throughout. This is a no-holds-barred wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,William Church,28.0,91.0,"A Bordeaux blend of five grapes, this melds blackberry and black cherry fruit with plenty of toasty oak and ground coffee. It's a nice mix of fruit and barrel, dark and smoky, but not too heavy at 14.2% alcohol."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),28.0,91.0,"Peaches and honeysuckle seem to perfume this lavish, aromatic semi-sweet Riesling. The palate is lush with sweet yellow cherries and peaches, yet balanced by sunny lemon acidity and a crush of minerals that linger on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,California,Bishop's Peak,28.0,91.0,"The top bottling of the Talley family's second label, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Cabernet Franc, 17% Petit Verdot and 16% Malbec offers tons of black fruit on the nose as well as fennel, thyme, oregano and a subdued licorice note. The palate puts violet florality together with fresh blackberry fruit, white pepper and a bit of caramel, proving both delicious and elegant."
Syrah,US,Washington,McCrea Cellars,28.0,91.0,"This is an elegant Syrah, blended with 18% Mourvèdre and topped with a splash of Grenache. Good phenolic ripeness along with substantial sugars lead into flavors that have melded nicely. Berry, truffle, chocolate, leather, pepper and coffee are all in the mix, and the mid-palate is delicious. Only a fairly quick fade keeps the score from climbing even higher."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Nodland,28.0,91.0,"All six Bordeaux grapes make an appearance in this well-oaked spicebox of a red. It's just plain delicious, from the first sniff on through. The firm mid-palate shows pretty blue, purple and black fruits, a touch of black olive, black tea, and those oh-so-tasty baking spices."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Bonny Doon,28.0,91.0,"Randall Grahm's blend of 55% Roussanne, 26% Grenache Blanc and 19% Picpoul Blanc shows sliced honeydew, wet stone and a flash of topicality on the delicate nose. The mouthfeel is steely with layers of tense energy, showing lime pith and faint green banana, as well as lemon blossoms lasting long on the finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Maal,28.0,91.0,"Exotic, earthy aromas of loamy blackberry, pencil eraser, brown sugar and violet petals lead to a deep but wiry and clipped-feeling palate. The flavor profile is oaky, with spiced berry and cardamom notes leading the charge. A lasting finish is stern and doesn't waver. Drink through 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Alta Maria,28.0,91.0,"Strong pencil shaving aromas open this 80% whole-cluster wine by James Ontiveros and Paul Wilkins, along with the dusty scents of raspberry fruit and violet petals preserved in pages of an old book. It's light and lean once sipped, with cranberry and raspberry fruits dancing across the tongue alongside green tobacco leaf, olive tapenade and peppery spices."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,28.0,91.0,"Stylish and complex, with its fleshy pear fruit set in a frame of bracing minerality, this is a wine of lucid clarity. It conveys the depth of looking into a deep, transparent mountain spring, with that same tongue-tickling minerality."
Port,Portugal,Port,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo,28.0,91.0,"This juicy, ripe and rich wine has a sweet jammy background, giving concentration as well as good acidity and an open, ripe texture. Drink this already accessible wine from 2025."
Marsanne,US,California,Qupé,28.0,91.0,"Bob Lindquist may be the only winemaker in California who knows how to make Marsanne in a compelling way, and his only grow more fascinating with each passing vintage. This shows dried apple, light melon, sweet chamomile and tangy lime juice on the nose. Racy acidity and tactile tension show on the palate, with light stone fruit and citrus flavors that will intensify with time in bottle. Drink 2018–2030."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,28.0,91.0,"Broad and warm notes of light butter, baked yellow apples, cracked apricot and sliced nectarine are lifted by lime-peel tension on the fresh nose of this bottling. Preserved lemon and toasted almond flavors show once sipped, framed by a creamy mouthfeel and tartness provided by orange bitters."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,91.0,"Wet river rock and struck flint notes accentuate the sharp, tangy vitality of this razor-edged Kabinett. Zesty white grapefruit, lime and tangerine flavors penetrate deeply on the midpalate, finishing long but lean. It drinks beautifully already but should hold well through 2022."
Rosé,US,California,Ehlers Estate,28.0,91.0,"Reddish-pink and orange in color, this wine made from Cabernet Franc grapes works on every level, offering a taste of pomegranate and fresh-squeeed orange that keeps it dry and refreshing as it goes down. Given no time in new oak, it exhibits watermelon and cherry on the finish."
Merlot,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,28.0,91.0,"Aromas of cocoa, milk chocolate, spice and red berries are followed by tart luscious red-cherry and chocolate flavors. It shows a pleasing sense of balance."
Chardonnay,US,California,Alma Rosa,28.0,91.0,"Quite light and restrained on the nose, this bottling from Richard and Thekla Sanford shows pithy Key lime and scratched grapefruit-skin aromas. There is a decent sizzle of acidity to the palate, with lime rinds, pith and juice playing together. Touches of almond and flint add interest."
Barbera,US,California,High Valley Vineyard,28.0,91.0,"This wine from a small, high-elevation district in Lake County adds fresh cherry and raspberry aromas to rich, softly spicy fruit and oak flavors. Smooth and easy in texture, it's supported by good acidity and moderate tannnis in a style for which Barbera is well known in Italy."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Antonin Rodet,28.0,91.0,"Château de Rully is managed by Rodet. It has produced a firm, dark and smoky wine in 2010. It's firm, solid, with an earthy, undergrowth edge. At the same time, its weight and density promise some good aging over at least five years."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),28.0,91.0,"Sweet lemon-curd aromas are laced with hints of petroleum and smoke on the nose of this brisk, sprightly spätlese. Intensely ripe stone fruit flavors dance delicately on the palate, laced with white blossoms and lemony acidity."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello d'Albola,28.0,91.0,"Here's an inviting Chianti Classico riserva, with an enticing fragrance of violet, rose and berry with whiffs of spice. The palate delivers a core of ripe wild cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon and pipe tobacco. It has elegant tannins and while it's drinking nicely now, hold another few years for more complexity."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kobler,28.0,91.0,"This is a delicious expression of the genre, medium bodied and forcefully crisp, with delicate lacings of cherry, apricot and peach. The underlying hint of vanilla gives it a welcome succulence and touch of sweetness though the wine otherwise presents dry."
Syrah,US,California,Larner,28.0,91.0,"For a lower-priced bottling, this is a fantastic wine, showing elderberry, black peppercorns and incense on a classic nose. Touches of asphalt, lavender, thyme and sagebrush show on the palate, spicing a core of elderberry and black cassis. Hints of white pepper complete the experience."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Gorman,28.0,91.0,"True to the winery's style, this wine pulls no punches, with aromas of black licorice, dark cherries and woodspice. It's rich and full bodied with a grainy feel."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Angel Vine,28.0,91.0,"This wine is 80% Mourvèdre, 11% Zinfandel and 9% Primitivo. The aromas are bright and fresh, with notes of raspberry, red plum and spice. The flavors are pure and tart, bringing a real sense of vibrancy to the core cranberry flavor."
Viognier,US,California,Asuncion Ridge,28.0,91.0,"Light honeydew and gardenia aromas show on the pleasant and clean nose of this well-restrained Viognier. The sip is as zippy and persistent with acidity as can be without losing the varietal character, allowing the ripe Gala apple and Anjou pear to show through the racy frame."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg,28.0,91.0,"Although the sweetness is not indicated on the label, this is a medium-dry wine, edging towards the sweeter end. It has intense spice, intense perfume, and flavors of rosewater and tropical fruits. It should age well, so drink until 2019."
Tempranillo,US,Washington,Watermill,28.0,91.0,"A jump forward in quality for this pure Tempranillo. It opens with a dark, smoky nose—oaky but compelling. The midpalate remains tight and hard, but shows muscular black fruits, good length, and leads nicely into a balanced finish with ripe tannins."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Savage Grace,28.0,91.0,"Light in color, this wine offers very pretty aromas of flowers, raspberries and rhubarb. The flavors are primary and appealing, showing a lot of elegance and restraint with a drawn-out finish. It shows no apparent new oak influence, giving a dazzling sense of purity."
Red Blend,US,California,Eberle,28.0,91.0,"This blend of 39% Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache, 21% Syrah and 9% Durif shows black-plum pastry notes on the nose as well as crushed asphalt, dried rose petals and smoked pork. A line of graphite minerality grabs the palate first, then comes dark red and olallieberry fruit that are lifted by notes of lilac, lavender and potpourri, followed by grippy tannins that entertain the mouth for awhile."
Graciano,US,California,Fenestra,28.0,91.0,"Touches of wood smoke and cardamom give an exotic streak to this full-bodied and dark-colored wine. It has deep fruit flavors like blackberry and prune, good balance and light tannins to enhance the texture."
Syrah,US,California,Standing Sun,28.0,91.0,"This wine from the Fess Parker-owned Rodney's Vineyard shows inky purple color, offering slightly reductive aromas of tar and charred meat but also violets and black pepper. It's full on the palate, hitting first with purple fruit and dried purple flowers before delivering plum-skin acidity and peppery spice. It's an attention-grabber."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Seufert,28.0,91.0,"This pure varietal effort includes 20% that was barrel fermented. This is flat-out delicious and overflowing with ripe fruits: a pleasing blend of oranges, peaches and papayas. It's rich enough to stand in for your favorite Chardonnay, while offering flavors that more closely resemble a New World take on a white Rhône blend."
Syrah,US,Washington,Damsel,28.0,91.0,"All coming from Stillwater Creek, this aromatic wine offers vibrant aromas of purple fruit along with herb, whiffs of smoked meat and violets. The palate is tart, bright and fresh, with lively acidity and good depth of flavor."
Red Blend,South Africa,Wellington,Nabygelegen,28.0,91.0,"An interesting blend of Cab Sauv, Merlot, Malbec and Tempranillo, this red boasts a beautiful array of aromas and flavors: cassis, eucalyptus, blackberry, fig, tobacco and cinnamon. With a velvety texture and medium tannins, there's a good grip to the long finish laced with accents of leather and black tea leaves."
Chardonnay,US,California,McIntyre Vineyards,28.0,91.0,"Creamy aromas of vanilla yogurt, custard, apple pie and cinnamon show on the nose of this wine from a longtime family of grape growers. The palate is crisp with pear juice, rounded with marzipan flavors and touched with light honeysuckle flowers."
G-S-M,US,California,Standing Sun,28.0,91.0,"Despite his head-turning concert series at his Buellton winery, John Wright isn't losing sight of good winemaking. This Camp 4 Vineyard blend of 40% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre offers an elegant nose of purple fruit, aromatic herbs and restrained woodiness. Elderberries and dried blueberries emerge once sipped, with cedar down the middle and pepper and Italian herbs on the edges."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Pikes,28.0,91.0,"Lush and creamy on the palate, this complex wine boasts flavors of slightly mossy, decaying cedar, molasses, damp earth and leather, all wrapped around a bright core of red berry. Supple and lasting on the finish. Drink now–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Four Sisters Ranch,28.0,91.0,"Smoke, red cherry and crushed black rocks combine for the intriguing nose of this bottling that includes 14% Malbec. It's juicy on the palate but put together very well, with ripe red cherry serving as the backbone to roasted meat, black licorice, dill and molasses flavors."
White Blend,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Esporão,28.0,91.0,"It's rare to find a Sémillon in Portugal, let along the Alentejo. And yet the wine works beautifully. Wood aging has given it sophistication while the natural creamy texture of the grape is enhanced by the ripe yellow fruits that are lightly lifted by a herbal, citrus aftertaste. This wine could well age, so drink now or, better, keep until 2017."
Primitivo,US,California,Deaver,28.0,91.0,"A very dark color and intensely ripe aromas precede flavors of black cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar in this full-bodied and thickly textured wine. It's impressive for the level of concentration and sense of saturation."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Francs,28.0,91.0,"Made with the involvement of Hubert de Bouärd of Château Angélus as consultant, this wine is superrich and packed with dark fruit. Despite its high alcohol for a Bordeaux, it is balanced and fruity with tannins the are comfortably cushioned by the fruit and freshened by acidity. Drink from 2021."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Oregon,Cowhorn,28.0,91.0,"This compelling blend of Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne—aged for three months in 20% new French oak—brings notes of barrel spices, apricot and pear. There's a touch of sweetness to the full -bodied, textured fruit flavors that provides a perfect counterbalance to the sharply defined, lingering finish."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Paumanok,28.0,91.0,"Paumanok's portfolio is full of winning wines, but the 2010 Cabernet Franc is a particularly intoxicating mélange of ripe red-cherries and violets framed with sweet spices and herbs. Bright acidity and minerally granite tones intensify the dried cherry flavor and the lush, furry tannins."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Stoller,28.0,91.0,"Lush and aromatic, with ripe pear and melon fruit, sweet spices and a streak of vanilla. The 20% new oak seems just right, and the flavors persist through a seductively long finish."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,WillaKenzie Estate,28.0,91.0,"Clos Marco pays tribute to the late, much-loved winery dog, and a lovely memorial bottle it is. All stainless-fermented and aged, it's loaded with tangy apple fruit and vivid acidity. Pineapple and citrus fruit provide additional accents, with a bright, concentrated, lengthy finish. Put this one away for a few years and you might be surprised how good it will be."
Syrah,US,Washington,Basel Cellars,28.0,91.0,"This appealing wine is already five years old but could use more time to show its best. The aromas of black pepper, licorice and blackberry are generous. Taut and tart fruit flavors come with a pleasing mouthfeel and a finish that lingers. Best from 2018 to 2021."
Merlot,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,28.0,91.0,"This is a beautiful wine from the nose on out. Complex and aromatic, it has Italian-style tobacco scents, fresh acidity, leafy highlights, and undertones of tar, licorice and clove, all wrapped around tart, pie cherry fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Grassini,28.0,91.0,"Fresh and stony on the nose, this bottling from one of the region's leading properties shows crisp lime and grapefruit pith aromas. The palate is edged with tart yellow grapefruit yet also offers warmer tones of nectarine-like fruit. Refreshing acidity and chalky grip carry deep into the finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,Goose Ridge,28.0,91.0,"This is pure Syrah, ripened to a heady 15.3% abv, yet still balanced and offering classic aromas of black fruits, espresso and roasted meats. It's a barbeque in a glass, with a smoky, lightly charred base and ample, rich, ripe fruit flavors. Drink over the next 3–5 years."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Lieubeau,28.0,91.0,"This ripe, mature wine is rich, smooth and full in the mouth. Fruit grown in the Château d'Aulnaye vineyard gives the wine a rounded character, with hints of tropical fruits as well as peaches, and a complex aftertaste. Drink now."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Penner-Ash,28.0,91.0,"Tart with melon, peach and lemon fruits, this was crafted in a mix of stainless and new French oak. Low alcohol notwithstanding, it drinks dry despite some residual sugar."
Syrah,US,Washington,Trust,28.0,91.0,"The Walla Walla Syrah from Trust Cellars is enhanced with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Lewis vineyard, and coopered in 22% new French oak. There is lovely fruit here, with sweet grape, cherry and plum, followed by streaks of chocolate and caramel."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,28.0,91.0,"This is 100% varietal, this winery's most popular varietal offering, and nicely distinguished from its other reds. Recently bottled, it was still slightly shocked when tasted. Dark fruits, most especially cassis, are woven together with smoke (no mirrors!) and bitter chocolate. Chewy, earthy tannins hold the finish and complement the wine's natural peppery spice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,New York,Paumanok,28.0,91.0,"Intensely ripe plum and blackberry flavors contrast dusty mineral tones and scintillating acidity in this Cabernet Sauvignon. It's sharper and more angular than Paumanok's Tuthill's Lane bottling, but has an austerity and elegance that's captivating. Its fine firm tannins are edgy still, but should yield beautifully over the next decade."
Sangiovese,US,California,1850,28.0,91.0,"This Sierra Foothills-based winery makes a compelling if atypical Sangiovese that offers black cherry, soy, crushed rock and rose petal scents. Upright tannins present strawberry, black plum and loamy soil flavors, finishing on a sweet-savory hoisin sauce note."
Syrah-Grenache,US,California,Ampelos,28.0,91.0,"This blend of 64% Syrah and 36% Grenache opens with white pepper and fresh rose petal scents. Thickly concentrated and robust, with meaty leather and blue fruit notes, it remains balanced and lifted on the finish despite its density."
Chardonnay,US,California,Hindsight,28.0,91.0,"This is a creamy, voluptuously full-bodied white, highlighted in floral aromas of honeysuckle and nicely defined flavors of kumquat and melon. Forceful on the palate, it's lingering and complex, with a spicy nutmeg character and crispness of Key lime."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Grassini,28.0,91.0,"High and tight aromas of chopped grass and cut tennis ball are met with a pretty floral element that veers toward fresh purple flowers. The family-owned estate, which boasts some of the more dramatic vineyard blocks in the region, offers lemongrass, squeezed lime, citrus zest and Granny Smith apple skins on the palate."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Pewsey Vale,28.0,91.0,"It's a rare treat when a winery bottle-ages a wine for you, but that's exactly what's happened here. The result is a top-notch dry Aussie Riesling that's just entering its plateau of maturity, where it should stay for another 5–10 years. Slightly honeyed notes soften the intense scents of crushed stones, then pick up hints of tangerine on the palate. Replacing the briskness of youth is a soft, lingering finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Sleight of Hand,28.0,91.0,"A new cuvée for the winery, The Conjurer is 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot and 13% Cabernet Franc, sourced from Blackrock Vineyard (adjacent to Red Mountain) and Blue Mountain Vineyard in Walla Walla. Bright and juicy, it's packed with raspberry and blueberry fruit, balanced against lightly-applied savory highlights. Lovely mouthfeel and generous length make this a wine that's hard to put down."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Miro,28.0,91.0,"Appealing fruit aromas and flavors join a velvety texture in this medium-bodied and beautifully shaped wine. It doesn't go to extremes, but has just enough ripeness and freshness to find an elegant balance."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Owen Roe,28.0,91.0,"A blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Franc (33%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers aromas of cocoa, spice, flowers, herb and red and black fruit. The flavors show concentration and depth, along with a lovely sense of texture that keeps the interest high. The tannins give a light squeeze."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Gary Farrell,28.0,91.0,"A 100% varietal wine from the famed Ritchie Vineyard, this is a tremendous expression of elusively sublime lemon and lime, with a juiciness of grapefruit. Crisp and refreshing from start to finish, it offers complex, creamy Tahitian vanilla bean midway through, finishing with zest."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Castello d'Albola,28.0,91.0,"Aromas of wild red berry, sun-baked earth and dark cooking spices blossom in the glass. The medium-bodied, elegant palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed black raspberry, baking spice and grilled herb while smooth, polished tannins provide support."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,91.0,"Sun-kissed nectarine, tangerine and grapefruit flavors abound in this exceptionally light-footed Riesling. Off-dry in style, it's juicy and forward yet spine-tingling and racy. The finish is pristine, dry and intensely mineral."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,28.0,91.0,"Dusty pollen and mineral notes lend spicy, savory complexity to zesty lemon-lime flavors in this Kabinett. Just a shade off-dry in style, it's vivacious and zippy, finishing on a lingering salty mineral tang."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,28.0,91.0,"It's 100% Cabernet Franc, a delightful, bright and forward wine with sweet boysenberry and blueberry fruit. Behind the bright, luscious fruit flavors are chewy, earthy tannins. They are ripe and dry and give the wine weight and authority. It's a complete wine—from the floral violet/rose petal aromas to the ripe berry fruit to the substantial tannins. The oak is subdued and appropriate."
Garnacha,Spain,Northern Spain,Alto Moncayo,27.0,91.0,"Oaky, heavily roasted aromas of hickory, baking spices, coconut and exotic black-fruit scents feed into a chunky but easygoing palate with spicy, barrel-rich flavors of hickory and vanilla as well as baked berry and leather. A ripe, slightly rubbery finish is generous. Drink through 2018."
Port,Portugal,Port,Ramos-Pinto,27.0,91.0,"Beautifully perfumed, this has ripe blackberry flavors and a relatively dry character. The spirit is now well balanced, giving a backbone to the violet aromas and spicy character of this still-young LBV. It is good to drink now for its fruit, but it will improve and show more complex flavors after 2017–2018."
Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,27.0,91.0,"Impressively concentrated for a Pinot Blanc, it offers intense spice as well as crisp apple flavors. It's bright, with good acidity as well as a rich and rounded aftertaste."
Malbec,US,Washington,Savage Grace,27.0,91.0,"Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs. It's silky soft in feel with a dazzling sense of texture and purity with little apparent oak influence."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Gamache,27.0,91.0,"The finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Jäger,27.0,91.0,"Conference pear and lemony acidity produce a clean-cut mouthfeel and real refreshment factor. The wine is concentrated but also is lean and soaring, supported by stony minerality."
Viognier,US,California,Paskett,27.0,91.0,"Apricot, peach, orange blossom and honey flavors all come together in this ultrasmooth, ripe but well-balanced wine. Zingy acidity blends with the rich fruitiness to keep it lively and refreshing, even while the viscosity coats the palate."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,US,Washington,Efeste,27.0,91.0,"This shows the textural depth of all the Efesté wines. A floral top note gives way to firm, dark, cassis and blackberry flavors. Light notes of herb, anise and earth are introduced and set comfortably into the lengthy finish. It has great power and flavor, with the possibility of cellaring for a decade or more."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Phélan-Ségur,27.0,91.0,"Parcels of vines on the Phélan-Ségur estate are used for this second label. The wine, with its firm tannins, is developing well. It has structure and a dense texture along with ripe blackberry fruits and acidity. As it develops, it will be generous and ripe. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Martinborough,Ata Rangi,27.0,91.0,"Better known for its Pinot Noir, Ata Rangi has turned in a fine performance with its 2007 Sauvignon Blanc. It's grassy, but balanced by ripe fig and stone fruit characters that weave an intricately detailed medium-weight palate. Long on the finish. Drink now–2009."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Gloria Ferrer,27.0,91.0,"This wine is lifted by vibrant acidity and shows bread-like aromas accented with wild strawberry, compost and forest floor flavors. Light-bodied and fresh on the palate, it's nicely crafted and table-ready."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Loring Wine Company,27.0,91.0,"Light red berries, red plums and cinnamon greet the nose on this countywide blend from Brian Loring, whose tasting room is in Buellton on Highway 246. Brown spice powers the palate, with more cinnamon, star anise and cloves, making for a food-friendly wine."
Muscadelle,France,Southwest France,Château Tour des Gendres,27.0,91.0,"One of a series of wines made from individual parcels, this ripe, lightly wood-aged wine is both perfumed and spicy. While rich, it is not overwhelming, having freshness as well as ripe tropical fruit flavors. Drink this wine now."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Saget la Perrière,27.0,91.0,"A blend of four of the best parcels from the Saget estate, this is a rich and structured wine. Its apple, citrus and yellow fruit flavors are just beginning to integrate with the tight, steely texture. Drink this wine from 2018."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Riojanas,27.0,91.0,"Ripe and leaning to the dark fruit side, with spicy blackberry aromas. Feels round and complete as it unfolds, and not at all edgy. Flavors of plum, cocoa and spice come with toasty oak, and the finish is bright and snappy. Will age for another decade without much trouble, but it's more than drinkable now."
Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,US,Washington,Lauren Ashton Cellars,27.0,91.0,"The blend in this new vintage remains three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and one quarter Sémillon, but amps up the alcohol a notch from the 2011 version. It's a lightly toasty, very flavorful wine, adroitly mixing slightly bitter skin flavors, citrus pith and flesh, and a tangy core of grapefruit and pineapple. The length and detail are impressive."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Türk,27.0,91.0,"Ripe, yellow pear shines through the savory yeast notes on the nose. The palate unites white pepper and herbal notes of chervil and lovage with lemony freshness. Moreish and appetizing, with a lingering white pepper and citrus finish."
Greco,Italy,Southern Italy,Cantine di Marzo,27.0,91.0,"Pressed yellow flower, flint and Mediterranean herb aromas fuse with citrus zest and a balsamic note. The round, savory palate doles out ripe apricot, creamy pear and juicy nectarine flavors, tangy acidity carrying a bitter almond tone long into the finish."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Amirault,27.0,91.0,"Perfumed, with a rich texture and smoky flavors this wine has density and concentration. Aged for 16 months in large wooden barrels, the wine has spice, red-berry fruits and young tannins waiting to be aged. Drink from 2019."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Municipal Winemakers,27.0,91.0,"Bright and fruity, this blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Counoise and Syrah shows strawberry, pomegranate, hibiscus, rose, sumac and fennel scents on the nose. A fennel element plays on the palate as well, alongside cranberry, raspberry and turned earth flavors."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Celler Pasanau,27.0,91.0,"Thick, raisiny berry aromas come with notes of licorice, mineral and black peppercorn. Feels tight and juicy, with zesty red fruit flavors, sweet black fruit flavors and shadings of schisty minerality and licorice. Smooth and sturdy on the finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Doña Silvina,27.0,91.0,"Generous, sizable aromas of cassis, blackberry and violet are inviting. This is juicy, with slightly wiry acidity creating a racy mouthfeel. Flavors of berry and cassis are loamy on their own but ride comfortably on a wave of tartaric acidity, while the finish is lifted and lively, with black-fruit flavors."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,27.0,91.0,"Produced from 25-year-old vines, the wine was aged in oak for 24 months. It is a concentrated wine that is ripely spicy, full of black fruits and tannins that are still very present. It is a dense wine that will develop well, impressively rich and still balanced. Drink this wine from 2019."
Sparkling Blend,Australia,Tasmania,Jansz,27.0,91.0,"There aren't many better values in rosé sparklers than this. Hints of toast and citrus add nuance to strawberry scents on the nose, while brioche notes add depth to the palate. It's a bit creamy in texture, yet remains dry and refreshing on the finish."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Montecillo,27.0,91.0,"If you like a traditionally styled Rioja then this will be highly appealing. Aromas of dill, tobacco and dried fruits are enticing, while the palate veers toward subtle fruits, more tobacco and finely intertwined acidity. This is a wonderful wine from an excellent vintage, thus there's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't age gracefully for another decade."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Pizay,27.0,91.0,"Dense and structured, this bottling is made from selection of wines aged in large wood barrels for 12 months. Black cherry and plum fruits are balanced by firm tannins and backed by acidity. It is ready to age. Drink from 2019."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Paix Sur Terre,27.0,91.0,"Crisp green pear and a razor-thin sharpness cut into more lush kiwi and honeysuckle notes on the nose of this bottling. A steely line of Key lime slices through the white peach flavors once sipped, and the palate cleans up with a tense, chalky grip."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Frédéric Mallo,27.0,91.0,"Subdued but promising apple-ripeness on the nose leads to a rounded, fully mature palate that rings with fresh and dried apple. There are hints of hay and and a wonderfully, clean core of lemon freshness that is supremely well cushioned on these rich, intense flavors. Drink 2016–2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Rozes,27.0,91.0,"Matured for 12 months in oak, this wine is full and ripe. It has juicy black currant fruits, plenty of firm tannins to balance and the typical minerality that comes from Douro schist. Drink this impressive wine now."
Tempranillo,Spain,Central Spain,Tikalo,27.0,91.0,"Earthy and rich Tempranillo with hints of fresh herbs, tomato, balsam wood and spice in addition to roasted plum on the bouquet. The palate is tannic and big but shows a ton of fruit and classy flavors of roasted berry, dark chocolate, licorice and dried spices. Heady on the finish and aggressive, but loaded with flavor, kick and quality. Drink now through 2014."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Schramsberg,27.0,91.0,"This elegant, dry bubbly has a light-gold color, aromas like peach skin and white cherries, and flavors that are crisp, fruity and vivid. It starts out reserved before opening up to riper, richer tones, partly due to 15% reserve wine in the blend. Not just for toasting, it will make a very good match with seafood."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Studert-Prüm,27.0,91.0,"A zesty lime-peel aroma introduces this finely textured, feather-light spätlese. It's delicate in frame yet deeply concentrated, filling the mouth with ripples of sweet white grapefruit and tangerine flavors. Ripe and fruity yet invigorating and spry, it finishes with precision."
Counoise,US,California,Municipal Winemakers,27.0,91.0,"From a grape rarely used alone in the United States, this bottling from Rodney's Vineyard shows tart red fruit, carnation and iron aromas on the subtle and fresh nose. Its ripe red fruit flavors are presented in a light-bodied frame, with vivid energy and clean mouthfeel."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Dürnberg,27.0,91.0,"Made from fruit that's sourced from over 50-year-old vines, this is a rich, concentrated single-vineyard wine. It shows notes of tropical fruit and pear, with just the right amount of crisp acidity. A dash of pepper gives spice to the wine. Showing its origins in the cool region of Weinviertel, the wine ends with a crisp bite of lemon."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Teso La Monja,27.0,91.0,"Brawny aromas of asphalt, roofing tar and rubber are balanced by smooth, deep blackberry and cassis scents. This is tannic and rugged, but the palate also offers buttery, oaky richness and depth. Heavily toasted plum and blackberry flavors finish with heat and a taste of dark chocolate. Drink through 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,27.0,91.0,"Stone, smoke and mineral oil aromas juxtapose deeply concentrated flavors of peach, tangerine and quince on the palate of this deftly balanced Riesling. While dry in style, it's lusciously mouth-filling, suggesting swirls of honey and citrus. A long, steel-touched finish dries everything up nicely. It's lovely now but should continue to improve through 2022 and likely beyond."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,27.0,91.0,"The nose of this pretty kabinett starts off demure, wafting fresh grapefruit, sage and lavender scents. The palate, by contrast, boasts tropical mango and berry tones. Boldly concentrated and brisk in acidity, it's a punchy, four-square Riesling with appeal well into the 2020s."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Michel Redde et Fils,27.0,91.0,"Redde's top wine, named after the winery, is rounded, rich and full in the mouth. Flavors of toast and ripe pear combine with tangy acidity, producing a complex, intensely fruity wine that should age for two years."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Mazzei,27.0,91.0,"Dark and dense from the get-go. Initial earth, black plum, tomato and smoke aromas air out nicely with a bit of time, exposing a complex connoisseur's wine that is the perfect candidate for three to five years in the cellar. Now it has such a pure, chewy palate that once the overt oak wears off, it'll be terrific."
Chardonnay,Spain,Catalonia,Alta Alella,27.0,91.0,"The to-the-point bouquet includes lightly toasted apple aromas and white-fruit scents. A chiseled, tight palate with crisp acidity supports stone-fruit and citrus flavors. Dry, crisp orange and tangerine flavors characterize the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Saint-André Corbin,27.0,91.0,"From the smallest of the Saint-Emilion satellite villages, this wine has swathes of black fruit aromas that go well with its firm tannins, dense blackberry flavors and concentration. Ripe Merlot dominates the blend, giving both structure and fruit. Drink from 2021."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,27.0,91.0,"A subdued nose of ripe, scented yellow Reine Claude and mirabelle plums suggests a sun-kissed wine. The palate reinforces this stone-fruited richness with elements of apricot and peach compote. This is off-dry but delicately balanced, rich but not opulent. Soft and gentle harmoniousness pervades from start to long finish."
Merlot,US,California,Starmont,27.0,91.0,"From the Napa side of Carneros, this Merlot is blended with 1% Petit Verdot, which presumably has added a smidgen of weight and color to the mix. Supersoft, the wine is well-rounded in ripe cherry and blueberry notes, with ample acidity, textured tannins and a strong finish that's awash in mocha flavor."
Shiraz,Australia,Australia Other,Brokenwood,27.0,91.0,"A blend of McLaren Vale, Hunter Valley and Beechworth fruit went into this bottling, and the components have knit together well. The wine is sappy and floral on the nose, and silky-textured on the palate, loaded with raspberry and blueberry fruit and ample peppery spice. Drink now through 2020+."
Syrah,US,Washington,Helix by Reininger,27.0,91.0,"Smooth and supple, this Helix Syrah is consistent with past efforts. There's more than a trace of herb and earth, plenty of acid and some tannins with more than a hint of compost and green tea. But for all that earthiness the wine has grip and concentration, with fruit that seems natural and honest. Don't look for jam or sweet preserves; this is more to the gamy, herbal side of the grape, but beautifully balanced."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Sipp Mack,27.0,91.0,"Developing well already, this is a textured, steely, very mineral wine that has also has rich stone fruits that give the wine weight and flavor density. Apples and fennel lend freshness and spice. It should age longer, so wait to drink until 2015."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Covington,27.0,91.0,"Boushey Vineyard makes up two-thirds of this wine, with the rest coming from Seven Hills. Fruit-forward aromas of cranberry, cherry, plum and spice lead to a thoroughly charming fruit-laden palate that shows a lot of purity. It's unabashed in its appeal."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Révérence,27.0,91.0,"This rich barrel-aged wine is a blend of 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It is a small, seven-acre estate just outside the village of Saint-Émilion. There are touches of licorice in this wine, hinting at extraction that needs to calm down. When that happens, this will be a dense and finely perfumed wine, rich and with a good future. Drink from 2022."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Bélingard,27.0,91.0,"The great 2010 vintage has produced an appropriately powerful and dense wine. With its tannins and concentrated, dry flavors, this wine is still young. It has power, the rich black fruit still masked by the structure. It will need long aging, so drink from 2018."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Brooklyn Winery,27.0,91.0,"Rich, ripe black berries, briar and bramble waft from this intensely aromatic wine. It's rather sexy, opulent and yielding with black cherry and plum flavors accented by tinges of clay, fur and leather."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Vannières,27.0,91.0,"The Bandol appellation gives this wine structure, density and a sense of tannins. It makes for a wine that will be excellent with food, rich and firm. It should age for a few more months, so drink from early 2016."
Carignan,Chile,Peumo,Santa Ema,27.0,91.0,"This Carignan from Cachapoal is one of Santa Ema's best wines year in and year out. This vintage is woodsy and dark on the nose, with boysenberry jam and shoe-polish aromas. It's tannic and powerful for sure, with flavors of ripe tomato, graphite, black plum, herbs and even salt. A rugged, briny tasting finish confirms the inherent rustic character of Carignan. Drink through 2019."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,27.0,91.0,"The best of this year's crop of Saint Clair Pinots is the Pioneer Block 4, which boasts dark and mysterious aromas of damp earth and ripe plums. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, with hints of mocha emerging on the supple finish. Drink now–2015."
Malbec,US,Oregon,Abacela,27.0,91.0,"This outstanding Malbec dazzles with scents of tobacco and chocolate, flavors of sour cherry and plum, and impressive concentration and persistence. The flavors gather strength and focus, adding details of lavender and lemon curd, as they roll into a lingering finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Luneau-Papin,27.0,91.0,"From basalt rock soil, this is a tightly coiled wine. The wine brings out strong minerality, a firm texture and ripe fruit. A touch of pepper adds spice and a dense character. The wine needs to age; drink from 2017."
Rhône-style Red Blend,Lebanon,Bekaa Valley,Massaya,27.0,91.0,"Deep garnet to the eye, this Rhone-style blend has a nose of cherry and aniseed. Flavors of cherry, blueberry preserves, fennel bulb, anise and violet are set in a framework of smooth tannins that gently coats the mouth beyond the bright finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Bollig-Lehnert,27.0,91.0,"A lush and enormously fruity auslese, this offering features layers of appealingly ripe fruit, ranging from honeyed peaches to tropically luscious mangoes. If it's a bit fat and lacks a touch of zip, it makes up for it with sheer deliciousness."
Grüner Veltliner,US,California,Baker & Brain,27.0,91.0,"Sour-orange juice, yellow-grapefruit flesh, citrus pith and wet-riverstone aromas make for a dynamic, tangy nose on this bottling. There is fresh crispness to the palate, with rounded nectarine flesh, a sizzle of lime-led acidity and gravel minerality."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Türk,27.0,91.0,"Very aromatic clouds of pear and mirabelle dominate the appetizing nose. The palate has the same freshness and fruity flow, especially of more yellow plum and a spicy hint of grapefruit zest. There is something fluid that suggests ease and joy. The spicy fruit flavors linger long on this gentle but refreshing, rounded white."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,27.0,91.0,"This is a compelling example of Oregon Pinot Gris. Apple, pear and lemon curd carry the bulk of the flavors, with a lightly peppery lift to the midpalate. The spicy character extends through a pleasing, long finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,27.0,91.0,"This has the structure expected from a wine in Moulin-à-Vent. It is dense, with a dry, dark core of tannins. The acidity, red plums and black-currant fruit characteristics give the potential for freshness along with a ripe future. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lafond,27.0,91.0,"Raspberry, dark slate, gravel and a bit of shiitake mushroom entertain the nose on this bottling by the higher-end sister brand of Santa Barbara Winery. Both richly juicy and brightly acidic on the palate, it offers flavors of boysenberry and sagebrush, making for a very lively wine."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière,27.0,91.0,"This full-bodied, richly textured rosé is wonderfully aromatic and floral, with dried spices, plums and cherries all mingling on the nose. Made from 80% Mourvèdre, it behaves almost like a good red wine, but with extra zest and freshness. You could sip it on its own, with white meats or even burgers or steaks."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Cyan,27.0,91.0,"Warm, earthy aromas of molasses, moss and baked fruit scream rich and big, and the palate matches that early announcement with cola, baked blackberry, coffee and syrupy flavors. Weighty and forceful, but not without style and a flash of elegance. Pure Toro; drink now through 2012."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Convento de Las Claras,27.0,91.0,"Concentrated dark berry aromas are powerful on the nose, showing a touch reduced but minerally. The palate on this young Ribera wine is pure and potent but not fierce. Ripe, loamy blackberry flavors finish muscular, with just enough elegance and grace to confirm the wine's overall quality."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,El Hijo,27.0,91.0,"Ripe bold cassis and blackberry aromas come with notes of fine oak and chocolate. This is thorough and saturated on the palate, with a mix of firm tannins and cushion. Blackened plum and berry flavors have a cola accent, while this is dry, toasty and displays tannic grip on the finish; drink through 2022."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg,27.0,91.0,"With its firm structure and strongly steely tendencies, this wine will repay aging. Orange citrus is woven into the texture of the wine, showing acidity and a taut, tangy aftertaste. It will need time to come together, so drink from 2018."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Henry's Drive Vignerons,27.0,91.0,"Although this starts off showing loads of vanilla and bright, boysenberry-like fruit, this is not a simple fruity concoction; there's some elegance here, and some savory notes of coffee and roasted meat as well. Drink this rich, full-bodied Shiraz over the next few years."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,27.0,91.0,"With only 56 cases imported, this may be one of the hardest Saint Clair wines to find, but it offers a refreshingly austere alternative to some of the winery's other bottlings. It's only medium bodied, with delicate, leafy aromas and pristine white-grapefruit flavors. Convincingly dry and bracing on the finish, it would make a brisk counterpoint to rich fish dishes."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Paul Blanck,27.0,91.0,"Taut and zesty, lip-smacking and dry: this Riesling is a successful combination of grapefruit and lemon, of zest and flesh. The dry finish makes the lemony qualities of this dry wine even more appealing. Serve this on a hot day."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Staatliche Weinbaudomäne Oppenheim,27.0,91.0,"Intoxicating tropical pineapple, melon and mango flavors are accented by savory notes of chestnut, spice and saffron in this nuanced Auslese. It's decadently sweet with a rich unctuous texture, that's balanced squarely by zaps of lemon-lime acidity. The finish seems to roll on in waves of sweet honey and delicate tea tannins."
Red Blend,Chile,Maule Valley,Oveja Negra,27.0,91.0,"This weighty, structured, dark-colored blend of Syrah, Carignan, Carmenère and Petit Verdot pours on the berry, vanilla and baking spice aromas. The mouthfeel is full, with a lot to savor, especially toasty, typically Chilean flavors of olive, herbs and berry fruits. A spicy, dry, harmonious finish closes the show. Drink now through 2015."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Sarah's Vineyard,27.0,91.0,"Hearty and earthy aromas of elderberry, beet juice, smashed plums, black tea, chopped herbs and turned loam hit the nose on this blend of 75% Grenache, 12% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre, 2% Carignane and 1% Counoise. Coffee leads the palate, but the deep purple fruits of boysenberry and olallieberry flourish alongside black pepper, leather and a beef jerky character."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Graci,27.0,91.0,"This elegant expression of the Nerello Mascalese grape grown on the slopes of Mount Etna has a lovely fragrance of blue flower, berry and spice. The polished palate offers flavors of wild cherry, crushed strawberry, mint, cinnamon and vanilla alongside fresh acidity. Energizing mineral signals the close."
Chardonnay,US,California,Savannah-Chanelle,27.0,91.0,"This bottling, sourced from the popular Tondre's Grapefield, is imbued with the scents and tastes of passionfruit. Fleeting spearmint and picked pear characters also arise on the nose, while apple tart flavors emerge midpalate. But passionfruit rules the day, and that's not a bad thing at all."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Ingrid Groiss,27.0,91.0,"Very fresh, fruity and appetizing notes of juicy pear make this very easy to like and sip. The palate is fresh and made light and zingy by lovely zesty lime and lemon notes. A vein of white pepper is fizzing away at the core. It's a perfect summer wine with the slightest spritz."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,27.0,91.0,"Concentrated notes of pear peel and lemon zest make for an intense nose. The palate is juicy, light and fresh and majors on white-pear flesh with a bright touch of lemon that is dry and invigorating. The finish tingles with white pepper and lemon freshness."
Vermentino,US,California,Tablas Creek,27.0,91.0,"This delicate but plush bottling is of a rare grape known in the Rhône as Rolle. Sharp aromas of pear skin and Meyer lemon rind evolve into fleshier scents of stone fruit, white flowers and wet river stone. Lime juice and fine flavors are laced across sizzling acidity and grippy minerality on the palate."
Red Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,27.0,91.0,"This is not an obvious wine, but one that creeps up slowly, takes time and impresses quietly. It delivers depth rather than power. Glints of pepper and allspice shine amid the restrained red, tart cherry fruit. The slightest of tannic grips stems from concentration rather than extraction. It's elegant Alsace Pinot, quiet but firm."
Viognier-Grenache Blanc,US,California,Brecon Estate,27.0,91.0,"Clean, crisp and stony aromas of lime zest, nectarine, peach blossom and chalk show on this brisk blend. There's lots of zing on the palate, with flavors of tangerine, lime and an array of citrus."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Collovray et Terrier,27.0,91.0,"Spicy, toasty wine, the fruit tropically rich. The texture is dense, the acidity important but not dominant. Delicious wine, now maturing well."
White Blend,US,California,Imagery,27.0,91.0,"This is a fun, complex wine, a blend of 79% Sauvignon Blanc, 18% Muscat Canelli and 3% Viognier, all mountain-grown. Orange blossom and jasmine permeate the inviting entry before waves of creamy tangerine and peach play on the palate, lifted by lively acidity."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Zull,27.0,91.0,"A beautifully perfumed wine, with aromas of white flowers and white fruits. It's rich and full of complex ripe fruits, with a smooth texture. Intense acidity marks the finish. Screwcap."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Lucien Albrecht,27.0,91.0,"Glints of spicy, salty soy sauce hover on the nose above a fresh cherry note. The palate is juicy and fluid, mouth filling and round, without being heavy. Cherry notes abound and play, pervaded by freshness and held within a frame of fine, ever so slightly crunchy tannins. The finish is refreshing, bone-dry, clean and moreish."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,Prinz Salm,27.0,91.0,"Hints of caramelized sugar and saffron lend a spicy touch to fresh apple and lemon in this off-dry Riesling. Spine tingling acidity freshens the midpalate, leading a vibrantly refreshing lemon-lime finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Willi Haag,27.0,91.0,"Honeycomb and saffron lend an earthen sheen to this intensely tropical Riesling full of sweet-tart tangerine, pineapple and melon flavors. It's juicy and buoyantly fruity, yet also complex, balanced by bristling acidity and a lingering tea-note astringency."
Syrah,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Stark-Condé,27.0,91.0,"Although it took a little while to open up, the wine eventually expresses itself beautifully with deep notes of crushed purple florals, black cherry and blueberry along with a hint of game. Lush and full with a satiny texture, the mouth is heady and satisfying with a concentrated fruit core supported by cedar and mocha on the close."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Careglio,27.0,91.0,"Fragrant and linear, this luminous wine is perfumed with woodland berry, black tea, wild violet and a hint of spice. On the sleek, polished palate, silky tannins and fresh acidity support bright red cherry, raspberry and white pepper. Drink through 2018."
Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Analemma,27.0,91.0,"More aromatically restrained than its Oak Ridge Vineyard counterpart, the Atavus Vineyard wine brings notes of rose petal, herbs, lees and spice. The palate is textured with tremendous energy and tension to the fruit and savory flavors as they dance and tussle toward a long, graceful finish."
Grenache,US,California,Parducci,27.0,91.0,"Extremely flavorful and wonderfully exotic, this full-bodied wine has intense fruit flavors like raspberry and rhubarb, with a host of interesting accents recalling cedar, white pepper and clove. The mouthfeel is warm and rich, tannins are soft and easy, and the finish lingers nicely."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,27.0,91.0,"Delicate whiffs of blossom and peach introduce this dry, buoyantly fruity Riesling, full of sun-kissed apricot, tangerine and grapefruit flavors. Neatly balanced, it's juicy and approachable, but brightened by streaks of lime and a steely, tangy finish."
Sylvaner,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,27.0,91.0,A certain creamy nuttiness is suggested on the nose. The sunniness of 2015 is expressed by a generous mirabelle ripeness. The body still is very slight and subtle and all about a graceful texture. There's a lovely touch of lemon freshness on the finish.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Escurac,27.0,91.0,"Low yields and a high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon have produced an impressive, dense and structured wine. With a smoky backdrop from the wood aging, it has rich black-plum fruit and a serious concentration. It is going to age well, and will be ready to drink only from 2020."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Jäger,27.0,91.0,"Pear, green and red apple and fresh citrus unite subtly to create a refreshing, slender and bright Riesling. There is a well-judged phenolic edge and both midpalate and finish are whistle-clean. Drive and verve are the hallmarks here, as is enlivening citrus freshness."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Leonard Kreusch,27.0,91.0,"This intensely fruity, primary wine opens with lavish aromas of marmalade and honeysuckle. It's intensely ripe, almost ruddy and tropical on the palate, boasting a cornucopia of sweet mango and pineapple flavors. Searing acidity lends balance and persistence to the finish. Drink now through 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Piattelli,27.0,91.0,"Warm, loamy, oaky aromas of pastry and blackberry set up a tannic, jammy, cheek-pounding mouthfeel. This is 75% Malbec and the rest Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's dark and chocolaty, with blackberry, prune and coffee flavors. A heaping of chocolate and fig makes the finish quite friendly; drink through 2019."
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Höpler,27.0,91.0,"This blend of Blaufränkisch, Syrah and Merlot is Höpler's signature wine. It makes for a fascinating combination of ripe black-plum flavors highlighted by juicy acidity and wood notes. The wine will age well, so drink from 2015. Screwcap."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Cloudlift Cellars,27.0,91.0,"Somewhat light in color, this wine offers pleasing notes of flowers, milk chocolate, vanilla extract, herbs and carob. It's light and silky in feel with abundant milk chocolate and cherry flavors that linger."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Van Zellers,27.0,91.0,"From a selection of different parcels near the Torto and Pinhão rivers, this is a beautifully ripe and fruity wine. With some firm tannins and a tight texture it shows plenty of the schist terroir of the Douro. Over that there are layers of rich dark fruits that are balanced with acidity. Drink the wine now."
Chardonnay,US,California,Edna Valley Vineyard,27.0,91.0,"This bottling goes for a ripe, buttery style of Chardonnay and succeeds. Pillowy aromas of buttered popcorn, plumeria flowers and vanilla-laced peach brûlée play into candied apples on the palate along with ripe cantaloupe and a long finish of vanilla-soaked poached pears."
Marsanne,France,Rhône Valley,Cave de Tain,27.0,91.0,"A fine value for a northern Rhône of this quality, this bottling from the Tain cooperative is full bodied and ripe, but with enough acidity for balance. Modest pear and melon flavors evolve on the palate into bolder honey and bergamot notes on the long finish. Drink now."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Ontañón,26.5,91.0,"Charred and oaky at first, the nose on this aged Rioja reserva also deals blueberry, lemon peel and spiced plum aromas. Tight, acidic and grabby on the palate, this is healthy but forced in feel. Flavors of briny oak, black currant and salt finish with bold acidity and choppiness. Drink through 2020. Fruity but also showing saddle, game and vanilla aromas, this reserva from a top vintage sees its whole exceeding the sum of its parts. Full and creamy on the palate, this tastes of barrel toast and earthy plum and berry. Smooth and impressive, this is as welcoming as it is complex and age-worthy. Drink through 2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Santa Vitória,26.0,91.0,"From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine. It is firm, densely structured and with solid, dark tannins. There is a juicy black fruit background to this dense wine that gives a lift. Still young, this dark and very concentrated wine will be better from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Preuillac,26.0,91.0,"A strong Merlot element has produced a ripe, juicy wine, full of fruit balanced with a subtle use of wood. It's a powerful, concentrated wine that has impressive tannins, rich berry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2018."
Champagne Blend,France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre,26.0,91.0,"Already showing some toasty maturity, this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir is delicate, yeasty and rounded. Coming from northern Burgundy, it has a cool climate feel, textured with orange zest and the crispest acidity. It is ready to drink, although another few years in bottle will improve it even more."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Girard,26.0,91.0,"With lees aging, this wine has gained richness, balancing crisp acidity with ripe flavors. Aromatic and with a flinty texture and citrus flavors, the wine is concentrated. The finish shows more of the herbal Sauvignon character."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Skinner,26.0,91.0,"Different and intriguing, this tightly wound wine has white pepper aromas, tart cherry and raspberry flavors and an engaging, astringent mouthfeel. High in acidity and relatively low in body, it has a vibrancy and restraint that will benefit from more time in the bottle. Best after 2019."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Savage Grace,26.0,91.0,"This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice. It's medium bodied, with a thick, textured feel showing good weight and intensity to the fruit flavors alongside well-balanced acidity. A uniquely styled wine without an easy comparison in the region."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Isabelle et Pierre Clément,26.0,91.0,"Made from superripe grapes from old vines that have aged on lees, this is a rich, concentrated wine. Full-bodied yellow fruit and ripe pear flavors are sustained by the tight, steely mineral texture and the tangy aftertaste. This dense wine deserves to age until 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Woodward Canyon,26.0,91.0,"From vines now a dozen years old, this unusual Walla Walla AVA Sauvignon Blanc is a brilliant straw color—aromatic with light scents of ripe grain and tangy fruits, and fills the mouth with delicious flavors of melon, white peach, lemon verbena and a dash of pepper. Complex and engaging, it finishes dry but leaves an impression of slight sweetness. Drink it slightly chilled."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Brancott,26.0,91.0,"One of Brancott's best Sauvignons in recent memory, the 2008 B is intensely herbal on the nose, featuring green tomatoes and bell pepper, but only mildly vegetal on the palate--well within the bounds of acceptable varietal character. It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with a long, mouth-tingling finish. Try with sole Basquaise."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Vignobles Berthier,26.0,91.0,"Rife with aromas of spring flowers, this wine is crisp, full of tight acidity and has a lively, bright texture. It offers good depth of flavor, the grapefruit and green apple fruits showing strongly. Give it until 2015 before drinking to soften the intense acidity."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Russiz Superiore,26.0,91.0,"This structured Pinot Grigio shows the true potential of this popular grape. It opens with fragrances of pear, mineral, smoke and aromatic herbs. These carry over to the creamy palate, alongside juicy apple, white peach, lemon zest, pastry filling and clove. Crisp acidity keeps it fresh and balanced."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Murrieta,26.0,91.0,"Cherry, blackberry and baking-spice aromas are classic for this winery and the Rioja region. Bright, elegant and just plush enough on the palate, this tastes of plum, spiced berry fruits and mocha. A composed, dry, loamy feeling finish isn't pushy or demanding. Drink this easygoer through 2021."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Rayne Vigneau,26.0,91.0,"Produced at the classed-growth Sauternes estate, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc comes from a 17-acre parcel. It has plenty of herbal flavors while also having a riper, yellow-fruit tinge. Lightly oaked, the wine is ripe from this warm vintage and ready to drink."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Vesuvio,26.0,91.0,"Named after the dovecote on the Vesuvio estate, this wine comes from low-yield vines. It is certainly concentrated while preserving plenty of open fruit. The black-cherry and blackberry flavors are combined with some firm dry tannins that will allow the wine to age further. Drink from 2019."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Bernard Magrez,26.0,91.0,"Rooty berry aromas vie for attention with molasses, graphite and earth notes. This Toro is stout and creamy in feel, with bracing acidity and firm tannins. Baking spice, roasted black-fruit and molasses flavors are typically ripe, while the finish is hot, with punchy acidity. Drink through 2020."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,González Byass,26.0,91.0,"The core aroma on this semisweet Sherry is maple syrup, but overall the nose is fresh and vital. Although creamy, this is balanced as a whole. Flavors of mixed nuts and toffee are familiar, while the finish hums along with no faults or bumps."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rosenblum,26.0,91.0,"Big, fruity wine, with layers of fruit, earth, toast and oak. Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit leads into toasty, dry tannins. There is a lovely density, buttressed with new oak, but anchored with ripe, firm fruit. Lovely winemaking."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Monte Branco,26.0,91.0,"This is a concentrated, extracted wine, packed with black fruits and firm tannins. As a reserva, it is constructed for aging, both sweetly fruity and darkly structured. It has all the richness of Alentejano fruit, while still keeping some acidity and freshness to finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Berthiers,26.0,91.0,"Still young, this rich and full-bodied wine is densely packed with red currant and bitter-orange fruit. Along with the fruit, there is a flinty, crisp edge that comes from the bright acidity. It needs at least two years to come together."
Port,Portugal,Port,Ferreira,26.0,91.0,"With fragrant violet and red-fruit aromas, this is an enticing wine. Its structure and its concentration bring out its richness and dense black fruits. The wine is elegant, on the dry side of Ports with some firm tannins as well as fine ripe fruits and acidity. Drink this now or (better yet) wait until 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Villa Wolf,26.0,91.0,"Stony mineral notes accent fragrant blossom and grapefruit notes on this dry, elegant Riesling. The palate is lean and steely, with a distinct line of struck steel and lime, but it's also buoyantly fruity with notes of luscious white peach and honey. A dramatic wine with a long, lingering mineral finish."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Bouissel,26.0,91.0,"An intriguing blend of Négrette, Syrah and Malbec, this wine is a selection of the best lots of the vintage. It has purity of blackberry fruit, edged with an earthy, barnyard character. It is ripe, generous, but not overweight."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Gordon Estate,26.0,91.0,"This is the finest Cabernet from Gordon Estate in some time; forward and pretty, with a juicy mix of red fruits. The raspberry and cherry and currant flavors are nicely defined and deep, underscored with crisp acidity, and showing the sort of youthful concentration that suggests further cellaring is in order. Nonetheless, it's a wine to enjoy right away simply for its luscious, exuberant fruit."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Abacela,26.0,91.0,"Stainless steel fermented and bone-dry, this leesy, creamy wine balances lime, lemon and grapefruit flavors. Those citrus notes roll through richer dried apricot tones and into a balanced, persistent finish. Drink now and over the next two years."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Raventós I Blanc,26.0,91.0,"There are few rosé Cavas out there that register this high on the quality meter. This elegant number opens with aromas of wood smoke, citrus and raspberry, while the palate feels lithe and silky, with a fine bubble bead. Flavors of pink grapefruit, tangerine and cranberry finish long and sturdy."
Chardonnay,US,California,Riverbench,26.0,91.0,"The nose is still emerging on this bottling by the historic estate, but nectarine, white and yellow flowers and a touch of cantaloupe are starting to peek out. The flavors dance between acidity and ripeness, with green apple flesh, lemon-lime peels and brisk minerality that build into a juicy finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Crasto,26.0,91.0,"An impressive, dark—almost black—wine that has the power to support the color. Solid tannins and ripe black fruits come easily together, offering a dense texture and rich feel. With its smooth character, it can be drunk now, but will be better aged until 2016."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,St. Innocent,26.0,91.0,"A sensational value, this blends fruit from a half-dozen vineyards that carry the winery's vineyard designates. Soft and appealing flavors mix citrus, plum and berry in a juicy, wide open, flat out delicious bottle. The fruit is the star, although a year in 9% new French oak adds a nice touch of toast."
Palomino,Spain,Andalucia,González Byass,26.0,91.0,"Pungent and pure up front, this 12-year-old Palo Cortado smells nutty and like toffee, with notes of orange peel and apricot. The palate reflects the bouquet, meaning it's clean and exact, with buttery flavors of dried nuts and not too much salt. This runs smooth on the finish and would be ideal in a savory soup or with sautéed mushrooms."
Viura,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Murrieta,26.0,91.0,"Lucid yellow in the glass, yet lightly oxidized on the nose. A spacy, unique Viura. There's dry apricot and peach pit flavors, and the mouthfeel and acidity are impeccable. A treat for explorers; eschews all blueprints for modern white wine."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine les Pins,26.0,91.0,"This is structured young Bourgueil, with its stalky dry fruits and spicy character. The fruit is ripe with good potential for aging as the cedar character subsides and the generous fruit takes over. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Peymouton,26.0,91.0,"A powerful, firm wine, very solid and rich. With red plum and blackberry fruits, dense tannins and a touch of wood aging, the wine shows considerable potential. It is already balanced but will benefit from at least six years' aging."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,26.0,91.0,"Now at its peak, this rich, rounded wine is full of spice and tropical fruits, and is full in the mouth. The explosion of ripe fruits is only lightly restrained by some final acidity. This joyous wine is ready to drink."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Santa Vitória,26.0,91.0,"Produced in the Baja region of southern Alentejo, this blend of Touriga Nacional, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is structured and firm. It has robust tannins, rich spice from wood aging and a serious, firm structure. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Rahoul,26.0,91.0,"Maturing well, yet with plenty of aging ahead, this is a firm and fragrant selection. It has a ripe berry flavor and a hint of truffle, with sweet acidity and a dense, rich structure."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Joseph Swan Vineyards,26.0,91.0,"A light, bright and lemony white wine that's textured and deliciously quaffable, this vineyard-designate is only available in tiny amounts and well worth the hunt. Orange blossom and juicy peach figure on the nose and palate without the interference of oak or undue sweetness."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Miraval,26.0,91.0,"The product of a partnership between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie with the Perrin family of Château Beaucastel in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this bottling achieves instant fame. Happily, it is also a very fine wine, perfectly balanced between crisp fruit and acidity. In the background a touch of tannin accompanies pepper and minerality. It is ready to drink."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,26.0,91.0,"Delicate notes of waxy lemon peel and apple waft from this light-footed spätlese. Its honeyed sweetness penetrates to the core, accenting flavors of pressed apple and pear. The finish is zesty and spry, leaving only a hint of black-tea tannins."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Rocca delle Macìe,26.0,91.0,"A blend of Sangiovese, with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this offers aromas of ripe blackberry, baking spice, toasted oak and a balsamic note. The round, savory palate offers black cherry, ground pepper, anise, espresso and tobacco alongside polished tannins."
Pinot Noir,Chile,Leyda Valley,Undurraga,26.0,91.0,"Firm cherry and plum aromas filter into a bright, elegant, lifted palate with freshening acidity and body to match. Juicy, lightly spiced core flavors of plum and red currant are draped with a fine oak flavor, and the finish is light, dry, focused and shows modest residual barrel notes."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Casa Santos Lima,26.0,91.0,"Six months in a mix of French and Portuguese oak has given this wine a rich, smooth character. Produced from a field blend of more than 40 different varieties, the wine is stylishly structured and ripe with blackberry fruits. It is still young and although it is drinkable now, it will be better from 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,26.0,91.0,"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Klipfel,26.0,91.0,"Peach skin and orange peel appear on the nose, the palate is off-dry but fresh and vivid with floral impressions that are more present on the tongue than the nose. There is ripe, fresh peach and honeysuckle and a balanced poise. The aromatic subtlety causes you to pause and wonder, even after the last echo."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Chateau Mourgues du Gres,26.0,91.0,"Drawn from a particularly good parcel of old-vine Syrah and bolstered by just 10% Grenache and Carignan, this is an exciting expression of Costières de Nîmes. Aged in 500-liter barrels, the wood component is subtle, adding hints of cedar, vanilla and great textural richness to the wine. Plum, licorice and tree bark notes finish long and velvety. Drink now–2020."
Petite Sirah,US,Washington,Animale,26.0,91.0,"The aromas start out quite locked up, with notes of purple fruit and flowers. The palate reveals fresh, quite pure aromas, with well-balanced acid and tannins and a finish that lingers."
Muscat of Alexandria,Spain,Andalucia,Jorge Ordóñez & Co.,26.0,91.0,"Aromas of vanilla and animal crackers come with a note of white flowers. This wine feels lush, round and a touch clingy. Flavors of pineapple, melon and vanilla finish full and sticky, with the right amount of cutting acidity."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de la Mordorée,26.0,91.0,"This is a full-bodied, ripe and rich example of Tavel. Flourishes of dried flowers and spices dress up ripe melons and berries, finishing long and warming. It's a rosé tailor made for cool end-of-summer evenings."
Riesling,US,Washington,Dunham,26.0,91.0,"Dunham's Riesling, from the same vineyard that supplies grapes for the winery's best red wines, is a rich, luscious, off-dry wine, fresh and loaded with flavors of just-picked peaches."
Chardonnay,US,California,Coquelicot,26.0,91.0,"The nose on this bottling leans a bit sweet yet remains zesty, with ripe apples, pears, lime sorbet and lemon-lime soda. But the sip is racy and sizzling with buoyant acidity, delivering tightly wound Bosc pear and Gravenstein apple flavors doused with citrus spray."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Fitapreta Vinhos,26.0,91.0,"Fermented in amphora in the traditional Alentejo style, this old-vine wine has a naturally oxidized character. It is a yeasty, ripe wine that is reminiscent of dry Sherry or Jura's Vin Jaune while preserving fine freshness. It is certainly a food wine, ripe and laden with apricot flavors at the end. Drink now."
Zweigelt,Austria,Burgenland,Hannes Reeh,26.0,91.0,"This is a bold wine with spice and pepper, but also great, juicy black fruits. The palate is rich—not too heavy—with layered blackberries and acidity over soft tannins. It's worth aging for 3–5 years but can be drunk now for its fruitiness."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Carabella,26.0,91.0,"This is the first reserve Pinot Gris from the winery—half fermented in stainless, half in barrel. The wine feels as if it's very lightly oxidized, with dusty, tawny apple flavors that recall a good hard cider. Its power is in the persistent, bone dry finish, that never quits. Drink now through 2018."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Mersiol,26.0,91.0,"Sumptuous peach comes across as almost overripe. There certainly is opulence on the rich almost oily palate. Flavors are very concentrated and have edges of caramel and barley sugar, but these are balanced by freshness and a pithy welcomed bitterness. This finishes medium sweet with lingering flavors of both zest and peach."
Muscat,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,26.0,91.0,"A touch of fresh bay leaf, wet earth and musk rose combine to make a very enticing intriguing nose. The resolutely dry palate carries these lovely aromatics with zesty freshness and lovely zesty texture that is reminiscent of grapefruit peel. It is its abiding freshness that makes this stand out."
Merlot,US,California,Martin Ranch,26.0,91.0,"Strong cedar notes greet the nose alongside charred red bell pepper, crushed gravel and elderberry fruit. Pencil shavings are prominent on the very full and complex palate, giving nuance to black plums, roasted beef, charcoal and dark chocolate."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Kim Crawford,26.0,91.0,"This top-flight effort features herbal, slightly pungent notes that accentuate the wine's ripe, nectarine-like stone-fruit elements. There's ample weight and richness on the palate, lightened on the finish by a fresh, green-leafy component."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,26.0,91.0,"It's certainly a big wine, as befits Madiran, but the tannins are well tamed, and contribute to richness rather than dryness. The texture is rough velvet, a smoothness topped by some tannins. Fruit flavors range from black figs to dark plum skins. It could evolve over 5 years, at least."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Louis Métaireau,26.0,91.0,"Its presentation and dark bottle suggest a premium cuvée, borne out by the ripe character of this toasty wine. Produced from old vines in good years, this is a wine that could well be aged. Creamy apple purée flavors and rounded fruits add to the richness."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,St. Innocent,26.0,91.0,"Aged and fermented in neutral French oak, this luscious wine is smooth and open, with just the right touch of butter, presumably from partial malolactic fermentation. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich, like a peach cobbler, with a splash of butterscotch."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Hedges Family Estate,26.0,91.0,"Aromas of herb, cedar, mushroom, anise and cherry are reserved on this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend. It's supple in feel, with well-balanced dark-fruit flavors and tart acidity that draws out the finish."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Riojanas,26.0,91.0,"Aromas of black fruits, integrated spices, licorice and tobacco are sturdy and almost heady. This feels layered, with structurally sound, slightly scraping tannins. Flavors of spicy cherry and cassis finish ripe, loamy and with a note of prune. Drink through 2020."
Tempranillo,US,California,Hovey,26.0,91.0,"Bold and effusive in flavor, this full-bodied red gives ripe, concentrated, focused fruit flavors that recall boysenberry and blackberry. Tannins create that grippy, dry sensation that tames big slabs of meat. An attractive take on a traditional Spanish grape variety; drink now."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Hawks View,26.0,91.0,"From the estate vineyard, this is thick with spicy flavors of fresh-cut pear. There's a hint of butter and a slightly minty aspect. All in all it's complex, rich and inviting, with penetrating acidity."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Olivini,26.0,91.0,"Still youthful, it shows aromas of fragrant white flowers, stone fruit and pear. The juicy, lively palate delivers golden apples, yellow peach, almond and hints of aromatic herbs alongside fresh acidity. It boasts balance and finesse. Drink now through 2016."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de Gayon,26.0,91.0,"Produced in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains, this structured Tannat-based wine is dense and firm. Its tannins though are just the beginning, the entry point to the rich black fruits and concentrated texture. The wine, from a good vintage, is powerful, dense and needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Syrah-Mourvèdre,Israel,Galilee,Domaine Netofa,26.0,91.0,"This wine has a nose of lingonberry, juniper berry and toffee. It is round in the mouth, with flavors of black cherry, red plum, cranberry, spearmint, and caramelized sugar. An element of toffee fills the palate as fruit flavors recede on the silky finish."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Montenidoli,26.0,91.0,"Enticing scents of Spanish broom, citrus blossom, aromatic herb, baked bread and mature orchard fruit emerge on this elegantly structured white. The rounded savory palate shows a nice depth of flavors, including ripe yellow apple, peach, toasted almond and lemon drop. A flinty mineral vein wraps around the lingering finish while bright acidity provides balance."
Syrah,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Jardin,26.0,91.0,"This opens with initially assertive oaky tones of cocoa powder, vanilla sauce and sweet spice that marry seamlessly with raspberry jam and boysenberry fruit. The palate is velvety and plush, with decadent fruit flavors and earthy soil and spice notes that hang around through the long finish. Drink now–2020."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Miraval,26.0,91.0,"This fruity rosé is produced at the property owned by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie along with the Perrin family of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. It is lightly spicy and full of friendly, crisp red fruits. It can age for a few more months, so it could be enjoyed in 2018."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,26.0,91.0,"Aromatic hints of baked Cox Orange apple and ripe pear are accented by aromatic overtones of ripe quince. Quince also shimmer on the dry, even slender palate that shows uncommon spice and and clarity. A pure expression of Pinot Gris, this is shaped by freshness and zest."
Barbera,US,California,Hovey,26.0,91.0,"Richness and depth are the hallmarks of this full-flavored, complex and complete wine. Attractive cinnamon and toasted bread aromas blend into ripe cherry flavors. The texture is smooth, the tannins moderate and the finish long. It deserves the best osso buco or risotto Piemontese."
Cinsault,US,California,Fields,26.0,91.0,"This is an absolutely charming, lighter-style dry wine that has a translucent ruby color, fresh raspberry and red cherry aromas and mild but vivid flavors buoyed by good acidity and very moderate tannins. Light body doesn't mean wimpy, though, as this gem has good depth and a lingering finish."
Merlot,US,Washington,Dumas Station,26.0,91.0,"This Right Bank-styled blend includes 19% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Despite its high (15.3%) alcohol, it's a meaty, complex wine that drinks much lighter. The berry/cherry fruit flavors are woven into a tapestry of earth, herb and spice, smooth and detailed, and the wine has a mouth-pleasing seamless quality that invites another sip, and another."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Koyle,26.0,91.0,"Ripe and lusty, this is earthy and foresty on the nose, with plenty of oak, olive, eucalyptus and graphite. The palate is saturated almost to the point of being too heavy, but that only means that lush, penetrating, herbal blackberry and cola flavors have a stout base to work with. A toasted finish with some bitterness closes this out. Drink through 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Love & Squalor,26.0,91.0,"Fine winemaking is on display here, as the blend includes grapes from six far-flung vineyards. It's artfully melded, with brambly berries, Bing cherries, cola, cocoa and red licorice notes. Seamless and buttressed with natural acids, it's not at all reliant on barrel flavors, having seen just 6% once-filled oak, with the rest neutral."
Red Blend,US,California,Joullian,26.0,91.0,"A pleasant minty character, somewhere between purple Thai basil and toothpaste, emerges from this 60% Zinfandel and 40% Syrah blend, along with strawberry pie aromas. It's still tightly wound and tart on the palate, with hints of red and black licorice that will emerge over time."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Joullian,26.0,91.0,"Tropical scents of guava and cherimoya with the mineral edge of concrete lead the aromatics on this Carmel Valley wine. Sharp acidity at first sip massages into softness soon afterward, upholding the nose's rocky promise as well as delivering lime-zest tang throughout."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Patient Cottat,26.0,91.0,"With intense, mineral aromas, this is a complex, tight and nervy wine. It has great concentration, serious amounts of acidity and a final series of herbaceous flavors that give a totally dry, steely aftertaste. Age until 2015 to round it out."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Pizay,26.0,91.0,"From the famous Morgon hillside of Côte de Py, this is a firm and structured wine. It shows the aging possibility of a Beaujolais, rich and full of firm tannins that come straight from the granite soil. The wine will develop well, packed with dark plum fruit that has a great shot of acidity. Drink from 2017."
Syrah-Grenache,US,Oregon,Jaxon,26.0,91.0,"Mistral is 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, aged two years in 20% new French oak. A pleasing hint of funk envelops the ripe purple berry and cassis fruit. Savory herb and pepper highlights come into play, and the long, smooth finish shows clean earth and a pat of butter."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Chignard,26.0,91.0,"This single vineyard wine comes from a steep parcel that is wedged between crus Fleurie and Moulin-à-Vent. It is deliciously packed with crisp cherry fruits and fine acidity. At the same time, it is structured, solid and with a core of tannins. It is a wine that will age for a while longer, so drink from late 2017."
Red Blend,Chile,Curicó Valley,Miguel Torres,26.0,91.0,"A blend of old-vine Cariñena (60%), Syrah (25%) and Merlot (15%). The color is impressively dark and so is the fruit—mainly plums and blackberries. Toast and dried spices from new oak give an additional impression of opulence. But even more impressive is the balance. This is no low-acid, fruit-and-oak wonder; the natural acidity of the Carignane shines through, giving lift and definition to the flavors. Easy to drink now, but should easily hold a few years."
Grüner Veltliner,US,California,Belden Barns,26.0,91.0,"From the only estate in Sonoma County growing the variety, this full-bodied white was aged in a combination of neutral French oak and stainless steel. Sly on the nose, it opens slowly with a whiff of sour apple and a squeeze of lemon, an intensity of savory dill and white pepper at its core."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Muga,26.0,91.0,"Brioche and buttered bread aromas lead the way on the nose. Malic acidity creates textural freshness, while yeasty flavors of green apple finish on an underripe nectarine note. Drink through 2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Saintsbury,26.0,91.0,"An approachable screwcap wine that is made in larger numbers than many of the producer's vineyard-designates, this is just as impressive in flavor and presence, employing less oak to provide a honeyed, tropical and fresh sensibility of drying tannin and a tangy finish."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Pauletts,26.0,91.0,"A rich, amply endowed Clare Riesling, with potent lime aromas accented by touches of petrol, plenty of flavor intensity and a long finish composed of citrus and spice. Hints of baked apple and petrol suggest it may not be the longest-lived Riesling, but it's delicious now and should be good for another five years or so."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Di Giorgio Family Wines,26.0,91.0,"While this wine comes out of the chute loaded with toast, mocha and brown sugar-inflected oak, the wood falls appropriately into the background on the palate, allowing cassis fruit to come forward. It's firm and tannic, with a powerful structure that requires a few years to come into perfect balance; try it after 2020."
Silvaner,Germany,Franken,Graf von Schönborn,26.0,91.0,"Whiffs of smoked cashew lend a savory tone to this spry yet silken-textured Silvaner. Dry and light bodied, it showcases a vibrant fruit profile of crisp green plum and limes. Drink now through 2021."
Chardonnay,US,California,Saintsbury,26.0,91.0,"Dark in color, this accessible wine is deliciously layered and focused, offering a core of golden pear, Gravenstein apple and nutmeg, with a bright laser beam of acidity."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,26.0,91.0,"Luscious honeydew and mango aromas entice on this fruit forward yet elegantly styled Riesling. It's off dry in style, yet powerfully concentrated with peach and tangerine flavors. Brisk with acidity and nuanced with hints of tea leaf and honey, it's a beautifully complex, yet effortlessly quaffable sip."
Merlot,US,Washington,Kontos,26.0,91.0,"Aromas of baking spice, vanilla and dark cherry are followed by lush, thoroughly delicious cranberry and pit-fruit flavors that persist, with soft, plump tannins backing them up. It's a hedonistic example of the variety: equal parts fruit and oak and 100% delicious."
Grenache,US,Washington,Trio Vintners,26.0,91.0,"This is an instantly loveable Grenache, bursting with ripe, sweet raspberries and cherries. Young and fresh, it's like sucking on a really good candy; then it finishes with a flourish of toast and mocha."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,De Bardos,26.0,91.0,"Smooth, deep aromas of bacon and dark berry form a proper and likable greeting. The palate is tight, with piercing but balanced acidity creating lift and structure. Tastes of bacon, vanilla, raspberry and plum, with cured meat, vanilla and coconut on the finish. Drink now through 2016."
Port,Portugal,Port,Burmester,26.0,91.0,"This dry, mature wine tastes older than a 10-Year-Old, with complex wood aging, spirit and acidity that have taken over from the fruitiness. It is serious and structured."
Merlot,US,Washington,Basalt,26.0,91.0,"Aromas of vanilla, clove, coffee and dark raspberry lead to a mouthful of rich layered fruit flavors. It shows impressive concentration, with fruit flavors lingering on the long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Belden Barns,26.0,91.0,"Fermented and aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak, this wine opens with a heady aroma of lemon cookie covered in powdered sugar, as a spicier element of lemongrass rears its head. Bright in acidity and focused, this textured white also shows highlights of grapefruit and dried herb."
White Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,26.0,91.0,"This wine is dense and structured, showing it this is still a work in progress. It has richness rather than huge sweetness with a dry core of botrytis. Bitter honey and spice go with the ripe yellow fruit flavors. Drink from 2018."
Tempranillo,US,Oregon,Delfino,26.0,91.0,"The Umpqua Valley is carving out a reputation for producing many of America's finest Tempranillos. Here's one to add to your list. Plummy, bloody and meaty, it captures the essence of this Spanish grape. The cherry pastry core is cloaked in smoke and dotted with white pepper. The finish has an appealing, softly leathery grip."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Tardieu-Laurent,26.0,91.0,"This is strongly marked by toasty, cedary oak, but enough fruit comes through on the midpalate and finish to suggest this is more than just another oaky red. It's rich and creamy through the midpalate, then finishes long, with mixed berry notes emerging at the end."
Malvasia Bianca,US,California,Refugio Ranch,26.0,91.0,"This Italian grape offers extremely consistent hallmarks, and this bottling upholds them with glee, starting with the strong orange blossom kick to the nose, enhanced by lime, honeydew, honeysuckle and slight chamomile. Then the sip is bone dry and extremely racy in texture, with laser-sharp flavors of lime and tangerine cream, leading into a zippy finish."
Albariño,US,Oregon,South Stage,26.0,91.0,"Eric Weisinger's latest release for South Stage, this is impressive, with pungent citrus peel, grapefruit and lemon scents and flavors. Honeycomb accents come into focus as it finishes, emphasizing its overall concentration and pushing it to the top of Oregon's growing number of Albariños."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,26.0,91.0,"This is a ripe, wood aged wine that has great structure as well as ample fruit flavor. It has a touch of toastiness—50% is aged in oak—although it is sophisticated and subtle. Apple, fresh apricot and green plum flavors show through the still young texture. All native grapes—35% Viosinho, 35% Rabigato and other locals from the estate—are the same used for Port blends. To bring out the richer, more rounded side of this wine, wait until 2017 to enjoy."
Merlot,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,26.0,91.0,"This is an impressive undertaking, made from estate vineyards across the region, all certified sustainable. Medium in build and intensity, it allows acidity to balance out the strong, interwoven tannin and power to remain buoyant in high-toned cherry and currant. It finishes with a flourish of cinnamon spice."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Ambra,26.0,91.0,"Aromas suggesting truffle, crushed herb, prune and pressed blue flower slowly take shape on this elegantly structured red. The bright palate is firm and linear, offering Marasca cherry, cocoa and clove set against fine-grained, polished tannins and fresh acidity."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fenestra,26.0,91.0,"Delicious peach and pear flavors light up this full-bodied, soft and well-rounded wine. It has fresh floral aromas and nicely ripe fruit notes on the palate, with a smooth, graceful texture and beautiful, lingering finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Bianchi,26.0,91.0,"Pronounced like “Cyrano,” this blend of 63% Petite Sirah, 28% Pinot Noir and 9% Syrah successfully mingles these distinct varieties. Crushed mulberry, strawberry and black plum meet with thyme and mint-chocolate-chip aromas on the nose. The palate shows similar flavors, yet is more subtle than a typical Petite Sirah, with a plush mouthfeel."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Bründlmayer,26.0,91.0,"Ripe citrus notes appear immediately, recalling Amalfi lemon with rounder notions of tangerine and mandarine. The palate slims down to a light-footed, slender core of juicy, friendly and invigorating freshness. Streamlined and lemony, it evokes a citrusy brightness that seems almost cleansing."
G-S-M,US,California,Brophy Clark,26.0,91.0,"Ripe blackberry, smoked pork and black sage aromas show on the nose of this blend of 51% Grenache, 45% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre. There is lots of energy on the sip, with lighter olallieberry flavors mixing with savory teriyaki, black peppercorn and Sichuan pepper spice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,26.0,91.0,"Dried herb aromas are at the fore of this Cabernet; exotic spice, smoke, licorice and cherry notes follow. Cherry and chocolate flavors coat the palate, showing vibrancy, while a distinctive espresso note marks the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Poseidon,26.0,91.0,Enticing complexity and spiciness give this wine a great personality. Aromas like toasted baguette join buttery and savory spice-cabinet flavors on a base of crisp apple. It shows a tasty oaky element that doesn't overwhelm.
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Joseph Drouhin,26.0,91.0,"This is a ripe wine that's also fresh and fruity. It has some structured tannins, along with a dense texture. At the same time, the red cherry and blueberry fruits have a crisp edge that finishes the wine with fine acidity. While the charity Hospices of Belleville owns land as part of its foundation, the wines are made by Beaune négociant Joseph Drouhin. Drink from 2017."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Abad Dom Bueno,26.0,91.0,"A potent Mencía with concentrated berry aromas along with intense oak, rubber and graphite notes. Full-bodied and sound as a boulder, with balance, tannic grip and rousing flavors of black cherry, blackberry and dark spices. Toasty and black on the finish; top-shelf Bierzo to drink now through 2015."
Petite Verdot,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade das Servas,26.0,91.0,"A big, ripe wine, it shows richness from the superripe grapes. It is bold, full-bodied and packed with juicy black fruits. It's like a fruit bomb, but structure holds it together. Drink from 2015."
Sangiovese,US,California,Amador Cellars,26.0,91.0,"An attractive spicy, floral perfume joins rich fruit and spice flavors in this full-bodied, almost thick but luxuriously textured wine. An abundance of enticing oak aromas and flavors mingle with ripe cherry and blackberry notes, while piles of fine-grained tannin give a velvety mouthfeel."
Riesling,US,California,Imagery,26.0,91.0,"This producer continues to impress with varieties that are outside the usual suspects, showing finesse with this dry expression of waxy apple and tart lemon. Creamy on the palate, it exuberantly releases stony minerality as it goes, finishing with a taste of wet stone."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,SonVida,26.0,91.0,"Ripe and balsamic off the bat, this Malbec deals earthy, well-oaked aromas of baked black fruits. This is full but balanced, with nothing too severe or heavy on the palate. Black cherry, berry and vanilla flavors finish clean, mild and smooth. Drink through 2020."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château Jolys,26.0,91.0,"The vintage has given a rich wine, one that is still young. Over the wood notes are ripe yellow fruits, orange marmalade and intense acidity. Age this concentrated wine for 2–3 years."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Koyle,26.0,91.0,"Woodsy spicy black-fruit aromas include notes of balsam wood. This is deep and layered but not too heavy; flavors of chocolaty oak, peppercorn and blackberry finish with a rich helping of oak-based mocha and coffee. Drink through 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Tour des Gendres,26.0,91.0,"A warm, beautifully balanced wine, with a fine weight of black fruits, juicy acidity, all rounded with tannins and some wood. This ageworthy wine is concentrated while remaining poised and elegant."
Syrah,US,California,Bianchi,26.0,91.0,"Licorice, blackberry extract and a slate-driven mineral element power the complex nose. There's great tension between hearty, ripe olallieberry fruit and bitter plum skins on the palate, resulting in one of the winery's best 2011s."
Merlot,US,California,Rutherford Ranch,26.0,91.0,"Dusty Mexican chocolate meets black plum, cherry and pomegranate in this light-bodied, rounded wine that's juicy and delicious. It's well balanced and approachable now, so drink up."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Trenel Fils,26.0,91.0,"This is a complex cru wine that has ripe fruits, firm tannins and a good ageworthy structure. It has a dense texture, rich black-cherry fruits and a finish that brings out crisp acidity. Produced by this Beaujolais-based negociant, the wine will be ready to drink from the end of 2017."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,26.0,91.0,"The bitter-sweet edge of dark fir honey engulfs nose and palate which nonetheless has a core of bright, ripe, juicy and slightly sweet pear. The sweetness sings with that bitter tinge. This is rich but fresh and balanced and leaves with an off-dry aftertaste of more honey."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Charles Sparr,26.0,91.0,"Lifted notes of rose water and honeysuckle blossom rise immediately from the glass. They remain just as perfumed on the palate, clothing peach fruit in floral fragrance. There is a pleasantly bitter edge and just enough freshness to stand up to the opulent flavors. This finishes medium sweet and has a perfumed finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Jean-Max Roger,26.0,91.0,"Like most Sancerre producers, Roger also draws on vines across the Loire in Pouilly-Fumé. This ripe full wine shows the richness of this appellation and also its potential for aging. Its lime and green-plum fruits are shot through with acidity and balanced by a tangy rich texture. Drink from 2018."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Olarra,26.0,91.0,"This Rioja reserva hits all the standard checkpoints with aplomb. Earthy loamy mossy aromas of plum and berry fruits feature a hint of tobacco and vanilla. In the mouth, this is full, with round but serious tannins. Tea, wild herb, black plum and berry flavors finish with savory soupy notes and prodding tannins. Drink through 2022."
Grenache,US,Washington,Kerloo,26.0,91.0,"A blend of Grenache from Angiolina Farm and Upland vineyards along with 22% StoneTree Mourvèdre, this wine offers aromas of violets, raspberry, plum and assorted herbs. The plum and dark raspberry flavors are pure, ripe and full while retaining a pleasing sense of balance. The complexity only increases with some additional time open."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Municipal Winemakers,26.0,91.0,"Very easy-to-like aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and green tea ice cream show on the nose of this bright and vivacious wine by Dave Potter, one of the forefathers in the evolution of Santa Barbara's Funk Zone neighborhood. A powerful grip grabs hold of the palate, making for a very racy and chalky experience with lots of length, carrying more green-fruit and tea flavors."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Schiopetto,26.0,91.0,"Green apple, Bartlett pear and citrus aromas follow through to the bright, creamy palate, along with a stony mineral note. An elegant, balanced wine with a fresh, lingering finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,La Clarine Farm,26.0,91.0,"The name comes from the Josephine/Mariposa Complex soils, gravelly loam vineyard underlain with crumbly yellow slate. This is a finely tuned blend of 72% Grenache Noir and 28% Mourvèdre. The aromas are heady in rhubarb compote and wild raspberry with a candied, perfumed character. In taste, it's more bright red fruit with an underlayer of herb and stony minerality. Medium in body, the wine delivers substantial length and depth."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Bindella,26.0,91.0,"Bright and refined, this conveys aromas of dark berry, tobacco, smoke and underbrush. The vibrant palate delivers juicy wild cherry, orange zest, cinnamon and a note of licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2015–2012."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,26.0,91.0,"The extra concentration of low-yielding old vines is apparent in this dark, brooding wine. The minerally texture and firm tannins are all destined for long-term aging. Made from fruit that's sourced from the foothills of Portugal's highest mountains, this has a distinctly structured and dense finish."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Alvear,26.0,91.0,"Alvear is one of Spain's most consistent producers of sweet wines. This vintage Pedro Ximénez is big but fresh on the nose, with apricot and caramel aromas and some heat. A creamy, thick palate is a bit syrupy, while buttered toffee flavors are rich on a highly viscous finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Woodward Canyon,26.0,91.0,"A rare Walla Walla Sauvignon Blanc, this is rich and round in this new vintage, fully-ripened to lush flavors of apple, pear and papaya. Great concentration and length are in play, though the ripe fruit shows none of the lovely herbaceousness generally associated with this grape."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Prima Materia,26.0,91.0,"This wine really captures the personality of the grape variety. Aromas are smoky, meaty and a touch earthy, while the flavors combine black pepper, dark chocolate and roasted fruit. It's an adventure in a bottle."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Rocland Estate,26.0,91.0,"Rocland puts out a number of inexpensive wines, but this is evidence that the company has quality aspirations as well. Filled with plum, blueberry, licorice and dried-spice notes, this is a reasonably full-bodied wine with a long, dusty finish that would pair nicely with steaks or roasts. Drink now–2018."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Costaval,26.0,91.0,"Arguably on the heavy and rich side, but if you like chocolate, spice and pretty good pop across the palate, this is recommended. Rugged but not out of whack, with meaty dark-fruit flavors and bitter espresso/pepper on the finish. Should come together nicely over the next two years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Yardstick,25.0,91.0,"This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Domaine Berthoumieu,25.0,91.0,"Of course, this 90% Tannat wine is still very young. But it's impressive, rich and concentrated and promises to age well. It is dense with both tannins and fruit, black plum and berry flavors dominating, cut by acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2019."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Sainte-Marie,25.0,91.0,"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015."
Rosé,France,Provence,JCB,25.0,91.0,"An addition to the worldwide JCB brand, produced by the Boisset family of Burgundy, this feels rich and sumptuous, full of ripe red fruits and juicy plums. It is also balanced and well structured. Drink this wine with food."
Viognier,US,California,Terre Rouge,25.0,91.0,"From rocky estate soils, Terre Rouge's Viognier opens with delicious aromas of honeysuckle, mango and guava, lightly put together with a jolt of wet stone. Rich in mouthfeel, the finish is woodsy, like the finest herb garden."
Merlot,France,Bordeaux,Château Montlandrie,25.0,91.0,"This vineyard is at one of the highest Castillon points. Big in tannins and also fruit, this is a dense wine. It has a dry core as well as rich blackberry fruits. Concentrated and full, the wine will be seriously worth drinking from 2019."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Gancedo,25.0,91.0,"Initial aromas are oaky and a touch raw, but soon they settle on raspberry and plum. This is a chunky, fruit-forward Mencia with dark berry, raspberry, spice, resiny oak and salty flavors. A full, lively finish is muscular but also fresh and bright. It had only eight months in oak; drink now through 2015."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Septima,25.0,91.0,"A mixture of coconut, cedar and marzipan scents along with gritty, briary black-fruit aromas precedes a lively palate with weight, power and balance. Flavors of berry, plum and cassis are bold, oaky and chocolaty, while the finish hits hard with mocha, caramel and vanilla notes offset by bright acidity. Drink through 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Point & Line,25.0,91.0,"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Stoller,25.0,91.0,"Though pale in hue, this is big in flavor. It's a textbook Pinot Noir rosé, sharp, tight and showing deep flavors of rhubarb, rosewater and strawberry fruit. There's exceptional length along with the lovely, fresh fruit flavors."
Albariño,US,Oregon,Treos,25.0,91.0,"Albariño is rare enough in Oregon, but virtually unknown in the Willamette Valley. This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more. Tart and tangy with brightly defined flavors of grapefruit, apple and pineapple, this is deliciously bracing. There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish."
Pinot Gris,US,California,FEL,25.0,91.0,"This has a brighter yellow color than most of its peers, more body, riper fruit flavors and—unusual for this variety in America—probably some oak influence. Rather full bodied, but well-balanced and very smooth, it combines peach and pear flavors with a hefty mouthfeel."
Chardonnay,US,California,Santa Barbara Winery,25.0,91.0,"Warmed croissant yeastiness matches up with sea salt and lemon butter on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Santa Barbara Winery. The salinity carries on the palate, with apple pie and butterscotch presenting a nicely oaked but not overdone palate."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Potensac,25.0,91.0,"Coming from the same stable as Léoville las Cases in Saint-Julien, the wine is finely structured with firm tannins and dark fruit. Rich plum flavors are counterbalanced by solid tannins. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
Grenache-Carignan,US,Washington,Syncline,25.0,91.0,"The proportions favor Grenache 55% to 45%. Four vineyards from three widely different AVAs contributed grapes, yielding compelling aromas of wild berry, raw meat and a brambly character. This is a wine that wants you to take a walk on the wild side, so put on some Lou Reed while you enjoy it."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Ashan,25.0,91.0,"Aromas of candy corn, spice and almond butter are followed by full-bodied, tropical-fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of richness and intensity. It's a delicious example of the variety, with a lingering finish."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Cave de Cleebourg,25.0,91.0,"Fresh citrus and green apple have a leafy touch and something that is reminiscent of wet stone. That taut slenderness is apparent throughout the light dry palate where lemony freshness plays the central role. The fizz is fine and creamy and leaves the mouth filled with freshness. This is vivid, has lots of verve and a clean dry finish."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Clay Pigeon,25.0,91.0,"This is an orange wine, intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry, with comparable aromatics. What truly distinguishes this effort is the finish that lingers and develops more and more nuances for several minutes. Don't expect anything that resembles Chardonnay, but pair this with salted nuts, meats or fried foods and you will be delighted."
Pinot Noir,US,California,La Crema,25.0,91.0,"This is an impressive wine at the price and production level, a great go-to for multiple occasions. It delivers earthy, candied strawberry around a light, bright core, remaining soft and smooth in texture and intensity, finishing with a tease of milk chocolate."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,La Purísima,25.0,91.0,"Aromas of black cherry, cassis and alfalfa are ripe and appealing. This is 95% Monastrell with 5% Garnacha; the palate feels ripe, fresh and free-flowing, while flavors of blackberry and chocolate are moderate but appealing. A long, toasty, blackened finish is in excellent shape; drink through 2020."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Andeluna,25.0,91.0,"This is a high-quality Malbec with fleshy berry aromas that veer towards raisiny reduction but don't quite get there. It's plump and buttery on the palate, with baked berry, plum and herb flavors that lead to a smooth finish with a licorice accent. Drink now through 2017."
Godello,Spain,Northern Spain,Avanthia,25.0,91.0,"This barrel-aged Godello is about as elegant and elevated as they come. The nose of dusty apple with light spice and vanilla notes defines elegance, while flavors of apple, lemon, woodspice and vanilla interact seamlessly. Everything is composed and connected; the wine is well balanced, lightly oaked and classy. 400 cases produced."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Manon la Lagune,25.0,91.0,"A big, ripe and juicy wine packed with black fruit notes and laced with acidity. The tannins offer a contrast to the fruitiness, bringing balance and structure. This is an impressive wine, the smoky aftertaste bringing out the wood aging."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Mas Champart,25.0,91.0,"A blend of 74% Syrah, 10% Carignan, 6% Grenache, 6% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsault, this is an elegant and harmonious wine. It showcases a masterful balance between lush, ripe black berry fruits and earthy, toasty spice. With its crushed-velvet texture, bold fruit flavors and lingering spice accents, the wine is easy to appreciate and enjoy now, yet structured enough to age well for another 6–10 years."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Ferrande,25.0,91.0,"In its youth, this is intensely grassy, the grapefruit and green pepper flavors adding to the general crispness of the wine. It will be an attractive wine, full of pep, with a fine edge of minerality, spice and vivid white fruits."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château du Châtelard,25.0,91.0,"Aged in wood, this cuvée is powerful, ripe and intense. The jellied red fruits are all sweet and rich, touched by acidity but mainly with good depth of flavor and structure. It would even be worth aging this for another year."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ken Wright,25.0,91.0,"Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes. It's an astonishing value, lushly fruited, tangy and laced with appealing minerality. The mix of red fruits, earth, acid and mineral is a perfect encapsulation of the pricier cuvées' strengths."
Rosé,Austria,Burgenland,Umathum,25.0,91.0,"The deeper shade of rose-petal pink promises intensity that the nose does not fail to deliver. Ripe red cherry fruit is framed by the aromatic lift of nettle leaves. The palate is bone-dry but echoes with that refreshing trinity of nettle, cherry and lemon. A vestige of tannin provides welcome backbone.I"
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Adelsheim,25.0,91.0,"One of the finer Pinot Blancs from Oregon, this vineyard-designate has a lighter mouthfeel than the winery's Pinot Gris, yet in some ways shows more complexity and overall appeal. Fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon carry a touch of almond. The bracing minerality extends through the finish."
Syrah,US,Oregon,Plaisance Ranch,25.0,91.0,"Grown in a rather cool part of the Applegate Valley AVA, this offers aromatics of cured meat, peppery herb and a dash of iron ore. The fruit leans toward black cherry, and streaks of coffee and cola add to the complex finish. Drink now through 2025."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château du Cèdre,25.0,91.0,"The estate wine of Château du Cèdre is structured, balanced and full of fruit. It has black currant freshness under its solid tannins and dry core, poised between the intensity of the fruit and the firm structure. It will certainly age, and will be best from 2018."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine Cauhapé,25.0,91.0,"The quest behind the name of this wine is to make Jurançon wines better know. Cauhapé is well placed to do this, and this lightly wood-aged wine is a good point to start. It is rich, full in the mouth with a hint of toast that supports the quince and apricot fruit flavors. Drink from 2016."
Viognier,US,Washington,Burnt Bridge,25.0,91.0,"This is a knife-sharp Viognier, offering precise, chiseled flavors of citrus rind, Meyer lemon and grapefruit. The piercing acidity belies a wine whose flavors are fully ripe, and deliver an extended, mineral-drenched finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rodney Strong,25.0,91.0,"Sourced from several appellations, including the producer's heritage Russian River Valley site, this wine offers smoky oak, bacon and blackberry jam flavors. Thick and florally perfumed, it balances its brawnier side with spice."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Signal Ridge,25.0,91.0,"This is a beautifully balanced and well-rounded wine that has light spicy aromas and generous fruit flavors. Made from nearly equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, the mouthfilling texture boasts tiny bubbles, good acidity and excellent fruit concentration."
Zinfandel,US,California,St. Francis,25.0,91.0,"Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular. St. Francis makes a flat-out wonderful Zin year after year, vintage after vintage, big and bellisimo."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Finca del Marquesado,25.0,91.0,"A mix of raisin and tomato on the bouquet is touched up by spice notes. This has a medium-weight body and hard tannins in front of live-wire plum, raspberry and mild herbal flavors. A spicy, lengthy finish is just right for Rioja gran reserva, and this still has time left on the clock, so drink now or hold through 2020."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Avanthia,25.0,91.0,"Lemony oak, tobacco, sandalwood and berry fruit aromas come together in fine form. This is a full, heavily oaked wine with big tannins and plenty of ripeness and power. Baked black-fruit flavors are propped up by spicy oak, pepper and herb notes, while the finish is spicy, woody, dry and long. Drink through 2018."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Canoe Ridge,25.0,91.0,"This blend of Syrah (58%), Merlot (33%) and Malbec (9%) offers immediate appeal, with ready-to-go aromas of raspberry compote, mocha and cranberries. The polished red-fruit flavors show depth."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Steindorfer,25.0,91.0,"A distinct whiff of tiny, black elderberries promises joy. This is joined by white pepper and iron oxide to play on luscious but soft red and black fruit. The spice is exciting and pervasive and highlighted by freshness. The fine balance this strikes is expressed as straight-laced elegance. What unpretentious, honest joy."
Merlot,US,California,Mallea,25.0,91.0,"Merlot is on the comeback trail and this is a very fun style made by respected vineyard manager Erik Mallea. Woody red and black cherry meet with cola on the nose, while the palate remains bright, fruity, refreshing and easy to quaff. Flavors of black cherry soda meet with a milk chocolate character, yet without any overdone richness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Moulin de Guiet,25.0,91.0,"Ripe and soft, this is a smooth, dense wine. Yes, it has plenty of tannins, but they're smothered by the concentrated black fruit that gives it its generous, rich character. It's likely to age well, so drink from 2020."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Montes,25.0,91.0,"Everything about this mid-tier Carmenère seems right. The nose deals black-fruit aromas along with black olive, licorice and herbal notes. The mouth is round, friendly and textured, with a mix of roasted plum, berry, herb, spice, olive and tomato flavors. On the finish, it's balanced and tuned up. Drink now–2016."
Syrah,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,25.0,91.0,"Cedarville remains an estate producer to follow in the Foothills, melding a well-farmed site with clean, clear winemaking in the cellar. Grown on decomposed granite hillsides, this Syrah has 4% Viognier, just the right touch to bring out the best aromatics, highlighted by sage. Dark, earthy and leathery, this wine is holding onto its tannin and oak, but given time to rest in the cellar 5–7 years, it'll scream to be served with cassoulet."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Thelema,25.0,91.0,"This is a surprisingly bright and enticing wine, with forward scents of red apple and orange that are laced with notes of wood and baking spice. The palate is rich and creamy, but not overly so, with good acidic cut to the lingering flavors of wood-grilled apple and peach. Drink now–2019."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Carlson,25.0,91.0,"Dark red cherry and baked red currant fruit meet a slightly meaty aroma on the tangy nose of this bottling from Chuck Carlson. It's lively on the palate, with punchy acidity and grippy texture, showing dried herb and tart red fruit flavors, making a strong case for growing Cabernet Franc in the region."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château la Mascaronne,25.0,91.0,This is a beautifully structured ripe wine that is full of dense red fruits and tightly wrought acidity. Crisply textured raspberry flavors dominate. This is a rich wine that can be kept for a few months. Drink at the end of 2017.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Jäger,25.0,91.0,"This Grüner Veltliner's salty, yeasty savoriness comes with a tinge of sage and soy. Its slender palate, on the other hand, recalls zesty lime and lemon. Light and sprightly with spritz and verve, there is something weightless and animated here, with a lovely, savory, herbal finish."
Riesling,Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,Szigeti,25.0,91.0,"An almost exotic tinge of guava and lime plays on the nose. The palate majors on expressive, aromatic notes of lemon and green orange peel, supported by a fine, frothy mousse and dollop of stone-fruit richness. Made from Riesling grown in the coolest part of the Wachau, this wine is unusual but utterly moreish with a fruity but dry finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Suau,25.0,91.0,"This rich wine is already smoothly textured yet still has fine tannins that give aging potential. With its black fruit and acidity, it's ripe, smoky and likely to be very drinkable from 2020."
Red Blend,US,California,Rutherford Ranch,25.0,91.0,"This wine offers high-toned cherry amidst a fresh, acidic backbone. The secondary characteristics are defined by cedar, forest floor, coffee and leather. Light in body, this is a great crowd pleaser."
Cabernet Franc,Chile,Sagrada Familia,Valdivieso,25.0,91.0,"Leafy, herbal aromas of eucalyptus, olive and juniper are big players on the nose of this firmly balanced Cabernet Franc. Spicy, herbal berry flavors are fully oaked and chocolaty. On the finish, this is blackened and tannic, with fleshy black-fruit leftovers and a dusting of oaky cocoa. Drink through 2023."
Albariño,Uruguay,Montevideo,Bouza,25.0,91.0,"Beautifully composed white-flower and citrus aromas open this Uruguayan Albariño that in many ways is similar to those from Galicia in Spain. A juicy, bright palate offers flavors of lemon and orange, while bright acidity provides backbone and length to the finish. Drink through 2018."
Marsanne,US,Washington,McCrea,25.0,91.0,"Dry and delicate with mixed fresh herbs, melon, green berry, spice and rock—lots of rock. It shows surprising length and develops nicely in the throat, seeming to add flesh as you taste. A really nice bottle."
Port,Portugal,Port,Taylor Fladgate,25.0,91.0,"Initially it seems very dry, but there is freshness as well. The wine has a sweet, jelly core, with soft tannins, well balanced. Raisins and black figs dominate, with the aftertaste bringing a firming of tannins and structure. Powerful and impressive."
Mourvèdre,US,Washington,Michael Florentino,25.0,91.0,"The best of the new releases from Michael Florentino, which has changed hands since this vintage was harvested. Autumnal flavors marry vivid, distinctive fruit to hints of leaf and citrus, elegant and complex."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Pardas,25.0,91.0,"Punchy and pure on the bouquet, this has nicely presented blackberry and cassis aromas that are offset by a whiff of dried cheese and leather. It feels snappy, fresh and firm, with toasty, mildly-spicy plum, berry and toasted flavors. Lengthy, juicy and healthy on the finish. Drink now through 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Spain,Levante,Rafael Cambra,25.0,91.0,"Aromas of kirsch, licorice, mineral and blackberry are strapping as they lead onto a balanced, flowing palate with flavors of black fruit, spice and chocolate. Easygoing as a whole, with a smooth fade to the finish. Drink now through 2017."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,25.0,91.0,"The cranberry and dark raspberry notes dance alongside bittersweet chocolate and spice on this directly appealing, outright delicious wine. It's broad in feel, with rich chocolate and cherry flavors that keep you coming back for more."
Syrah,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,25.0,91.0,"This is a powerful, sappy, sensuous and fragrantly fruit-driven mix of Syrah from the Seven Hills, Clifton, Bacchus, Candy Mountain, Willard, Pheasant and Stone Tree vineyards—a true Columbia Valley potpourri. It's blended with 7% Grenache from Stone Tree as well, adding floral/violet highlights. It's a well-made Syrah that reflects the particular Washington profile of floral aromas, tart berry fruit and juicy acids. Excellent focus and definition in a style built for acid lovers."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Laporte,25.0,91.0,"Rich, full of citrus and ripe apple flavors, this is a sophisticated wine. The mineral texture and the dense fruit flavors offer a delicious take on Sauvignon Blanc, giving complexity and ripeness. Drink this wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Gitton Père et Fils,25.0,91.0,"Ostentatiously ripe, this full-bodied wine hardly hides its richness. It's generous and packed with fruitiness. The acidity and the tighter texture are backdrops to this great burst of fruit. Drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Weingut Stiftung St. Nikolaus-Hospital,25.0,91.0,Spice and saffron notes introduce this lavishly fruity sun-kissed wine. Pristine stone-fruit and pineapple flavors are delightfully plump but balanced in sweetness and jolted by shocks of lemon-lime acidity. This is gorgeously penetrating through a long lingering finish.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,25.0,91.0,"Wood-aged and ripe, this is a full, generous blend of Alicante Bouschet, Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional. Full of rounded black fruits and firm tannins, it needs further aging to bring out the full suppleness and richness. Drink from 2019."
Merlot,US,Washington,Barrister,25.0,91.0,"These Dwelley vineyard grapes display bright raspberry fruit, lively acids, and a more tightly refined structure than the other Barrister Merlots. Along with the higher acidity of the 2006 vintage, there seems to be a more gentle touch with the new oak as well, although plenty of coffee and smoke flavors roll out in the finish."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Chakana,25.0,91.0,"Heavily toasted and loaded with black cherry and blackberry aromas, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot pushes cola, chewy plum and black-fruit flavors. The back end is all about coffee, mocha and bitter chocolate, and as a whole this wine shows Argentina in a fine light. As for the winery, Chakana almost always gets it right."
Rosé,France,Provence,Mas de Cadenet,25.0,91.0,This estate wine has rich fruits that are totally balanced with the acidity and the ripe red fruit flavors. A crisp texture offers acidity and a full body. It will be even better by the end of 2014.
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Raats Family,25.0,91.0,"Ripe and forward, this attractive and well-balanced wine is delicious now but also shows the stuffing to evolve over the next few years. Complex yet focused, notes of apple, yellow melon, citrus zest, toasted brioche and beeswax mix harmoniously, ending with a long and evolving finish that transitions from bright fruit to lush oak and finally subtle sweet spice."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,25.0,91.0,"Still quite compact with youthful tension and energy, this will reward your patience. Dense flavors of raspberry, boysenberry and cassis are streaked with espresso and dark chocolate. The length is impressive."
Riesling,US,New York,Boundary Breaks,25.0,91.0,"The floral spray and sweet nectar of fresh yellow cherries persist from start to finish on this penetrating semi-sweet wine. It's rich and ripe with stone fruit flavors, but balanced with tart lime acidity and steely, honed minerality."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Cadence,25.0,91.0,"This four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend offers firm, concentrated plum and cassis fruit, stiff tannins and a touch of iron and graphite. It saw 45% new French oak—pretty impressive for a $25 red."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Sainte Roseline,25.0,91.0,"The wine feels rich, dense and packed with ripe fruitiness. Delicious, refreshing acidity gives these red fruits a lift and crispness. This is a serious wine, demanding food."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mendel,25.0,91.0,"This is a supremely rich, extracted Cabernet Sauvignon. Grapy black-plum aromas are more dense, inky and concentrated than elegant. That theme carries onto the palate, which is full and tannic. Blackened flavors of cassis, toast, chocolate and herbal black fruits finish with chewy tannins and a note of coconut. Drink through 2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Navarro,25.0,91.0,"Light apple and Anjou pear aromas, tangy fruit flavors shaded by butter and almond, and a supple texture add up to a sleek and flavorful wine. This is balanced, medium bodied and reflects the house style of Navarro that ensures a svelte mouthfeel with no rough edges."
Grenache Blanc,US,Washington,Two Vintners,25.0,91.0,"Sourced from the Boushey Vineyard, this includes 10% Roussanne. One-third was barrel-fermented, resulting in an especially rich mouthfeel, with a lush core of melon, tangerine, pineapple, papaya and citrus flavors. It has excellent length and power."
Chardonnay,US,California,Tondré,25.0,91.0,"Intriguing notes of honey, poached pear, apple with drizzled caramel and a light touch of marzipan show on the nose on this bottling that leans somewhat sweet in aromas. But the sip is dry, with Asian pear, jasmine and honeysuckle elements, quite crisp and engaging for the palate on multiple levels."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fritz,25.0,91.0,"Crème brûlée informs the creamy backbone of an otherwise high-toned Chardonnay, the acidity brisk on the palate without veering over the edge. Layers of apple and pear give additional lift in between a yeasty texture."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,25.0,91.0,"This is a wine for long-term aging, rich, wood-aged and seriously dense. Firm tannins, dark berry fruits and layers of wood extract come from 12 months in barrel. It has spice, acidity and a sense of brooding power. Drink from 2017."
Malbec,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Viu Manent,25.0,91.0,"Rich, ripe blackberry, cassis and leathery aromas are full, stately and fitting for this lush, layered, tannic offering from Viu Manent's top Malbec vineyard. Toasty flavors of blackberry, black currant, herbs and chocolate finish chewy, beefy and full, with a hint of resiny oak. Drink through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Double Canyon,25.0,91.0,"Wood spice, herb, tangerine peel and blue- and black-fruit aromas are followed by a fresh, flavorful palate. The grip of the tannins makes the variety unmistakable and the balance is spot on."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,25.0,91.0,"A kaleidoscope of sweet, sun-kissed fruit, this dazzling kabinett offers an array of glazed grapefruit, tangerine and stone fruit flavors. It's exceptionally light and airy in texture but penetrates deeply. Spry acidity and a sheen of crushed minerals freshens the midpalate, guiding a clean, citrusy finish. Drink now through 2021 to enjoy its youthful exuberance."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Les Frères Perroud,25.0,91.0,"A two-acre parcel of 75-year-old vines is the source of this jewel of a wine. It is ripe, full bodied and packed with dark fruits. The tannins and the structure promise some aging. Concentrated from the old vines and with a mineral, tight texture, the wine will take its time to be ready. Drink from 2018."
Syrah,Chile,Buin,Concha y Toro,25.0,91.0,"Earthy aromas of crushed rocks and sea shells are backed by scents of garrigue and herbal black plum. This wine feels both lush and racy. Spicy, peppery plum flavors run long on a finish that shows a toasty accent. Drink through 2021."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Bertrand,25.0,91.0,"From sand and granite soil, this firmly structured wine has dark tannins as well as the more familiar red-cherry flavors of Beaujolais. As it develops, it will become rich and fruity, juicy with good acidity. Drink from 2019."

Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Celler Bàrbara Forés,25.0,91.0,"This light dry red-fruit dominated offering is 70% Morenillo and the rest Garnacha. With tomatoey and earthy red-fruit aromas and a well-formed juicy palate, this delivers a nice mix of spice, pepper, plum and berry flavors prior to a peppery, fresh, elegant finish. Drink through 2020."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Geyerhof,25.0,91.0,A reticent nose merely signals zesty freshness and some spicy herbal hints. The palate fleshes this out with light-footed citrus freshness that has an appetizing tinge of soy-savoriness and a zesty yet spicy finish. This is light in body but heavy on flavor.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,25.0,91.0,"Freshly cut Conference pear peel notes abound. The palate has a slightly phenolic, pleasantly bitter edge that will come into its own with food. The beautiful pear and aloe vera notes last long after the last sip. This deserves a whole evening of your attention—the flavors here unfold slowly."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Howard Park,25.0,91.0,"Howard Park's single-vineyard Cabernet and Shiraz bottlings offer consistently good value for the money. The 2005 Scotsdale Shiraz delivers layers of mixed berries, baking spices and hints of dried fruit and toasty oak. It's full-bodied, lush and creamy-textured in the mouth, with a long finish powered by fruit and shaped by dusty tannins. Drink now-2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Landat,25.0,91.0,"Dry and serious, this firm wine is classic Bordeaux. It has weight, a core of tannins and black currant fruitiness that needs time to fully integrate with the dense structure. Give this exemplary wine another five years."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Ashan,25.0,91.0,"This wine offers a pleasing mixture of aromas and flavors of baking spices, pear and apple. Viscosity and weight gives it a sense of gravitas but never gets bogged down."
Chardonnay,US,California,Scott Family,25.0,91.0,"A buttery style, this bottling offers popcorn, sea salt caramel and vanilla cookies on the nose alongside tropical coconut, ripe peach and banana fruit, all judiciously presented. There's an immediate sizzle of acidity to cut through the butter on the palate, where pan-fried apples, squeezed lemons and almonds make for an excellent California Chardonnay."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stadt Krems,25.0,91.0,"Soft scents of leafy ferns and freshly cut Conference pears are subtly inviting. The palate then trumps with a textured dryness and that softly spiced pepperiness that is Grüner's hallmark. This is classy and grown-up, with lots of zesty, fresh citrus notes thrown in."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Paul Dolan,25.0,91.0,"The smell of new leather and cigar box continues right into the flavors of this deep-colored, densely textured, quite tannic and full-bodied wine. That funky vein meets deep fruit flavors like black currants, so those who like a little adventure in their wine will love it."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Ottella,25.0,91.0,"Jasmine, honeysuckle and tropical fruit aromas lead the nose. The round palate doles out juicy peach, mature pear and green apple. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while a mineral vein and an herbal note add depth."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Monterinaldi,25.0,91.0,"This vibrant blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Merlot opens with an intense fragrance of violet, lilac and raspberries accented with whiffs of orange peel and sandalwood. Juicy black cherry, black plum, white pepper and cinnamon-spice take center stage on the palate alongside a firm, tannic backbone. Already delicious, hold for complexity. Drink through 2018."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Foxen,25.0,91.0,"One of the more anticipated alternative whites from Santa Barbara County each year, this wine shows light honey brittle, sour tangerine and a touch of sour cream on a bright and lithe nose. The palate offers delicate cherimoya and soft nectarine fruit cut by lime juice and orange rinds, proving light but bursting with energy and flavors."
Riesling,US,Washington,Woodward Canyon,25.0,91.0,"Fragrant with scents of citrus rind, this brings a dense core of lemon, lime and grapefruit, just bordering hints of peach. It's quite dry, very fruity and substantial. It was sourced entirely from the DuBrul vineyard."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,25.0,91.0,"This is a full, perfumed wine that's medium sweet in flavor. It is rich in spice, packed with honey and lychees, and well balanced with light acidity. The wine has an opulence and a warming aftertaste. Drink until 2022."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Pierre Morin,25.0,91.0,"From old vines grown on two different types of chalk soil, this wine is intense and rich. It has ripe apple and pear fruitiness which is balanced by the tangy acidity. The natural concentration from low-yield old vines adds to the density of the wine. Drink from 2018."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Chacewater,25.0,91.0,"This is a full-bore, concentrated and tannic wine that lives up to the reputation of a not exactly “petite” varietal. It starts with smoky black pepper aromas, then offers concentrated blackberry, dark chocolate and charred meat flavors, along with a rich wrapping of fine-grained tannins. Best after 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Rocim,25.0,91.0,"This ripe, black-fruit-flavored wine is concentrated and intense. Big, bold tannins partner with rich blackberry and black-plum fruits. The weight is balanced by acidity and bright fruit at the end. Drink this wine now."
Rosé,Germany,Baden,Franz Keller,25.0,91.0,"Offering buoyantly fresh fruit and mineral intensity, this Pinot Noir rosé is well worth finding in quantity to enjoy year-round, not just as a summer quaffer. Zesty acidity and a light, finely textured body are amplified by plump, fresh raspberry and peach flavors. Its briskly mineral finish is exhilarating."
Pinot Noir,US,Washington,Analemma,25.0,91.0,"Fermented 50% whole cluster and aged in neutral oak and concrete, this appealing wine offers notes of wild strawberries, brown stems and cigar box. It's fully flavored with a supple feel, with tannins that will benefit from some time in the cellar and a cinnamon-filled finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Larose-Trintaudon,25.0,91.0,"One of the largest estates in the Médoc, this misses being in Pauillac by being—literally—on the wrong side of the rail tracks. Regardless, the location ultimately gives the wine depth and richness. It's ripe, dark, dense and very structured, showing the new wood that will integrate. Drink from 2018."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Balgownie Estate,25.0,91.0,"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a lush, velvety Shiraz that nevertheless seems to possess enough structure to age successfully. Cassis, molasses and vanilla all play roles in the aroma and flavor profiles, while a mocha note chimes in on the long finish. Drink now–2025."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Tranche,25.0,91.0,"Emblematic of the new direction for Tranche, this pure varietal has power and presence. It gracefully captures the herbaceous aspect of the grape, without sacrificing the deep purple fruit. Fragrant on entry, though the tannins are still a little hard and chewy. Balanced and complex."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Siaurac,25.0,91.0,"The ample fruitiness of this 80% Merlot wine is right up front. It comes from a large 116-acre estate on the extension of the Pomerol plateau. Firm tannins as well as generous black plum and berry fruits are well balanced, just needing time to soften and fill out. Drink this full, rich wine from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Parras Wines,25.0,91.0,"Aged for eight months in new wood, this wine has enough rich fruit to balance out the toast flavors. The result is a ripe, full-bodied wine packed with black-currant and black-plum flavors. It is a dense wine, likely to age well over the next few years. Drink this serious wine from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Santa Barbara Winery,25.0,91.0,"Warm butter and light toasted oak scents meld with smoked lemon and walnut hints on the nose of this reserve bottling. The palate is soft and almost sweet upon entry, its cashew and roasted apple flavors buttressed by a grippy tannic texture."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de l'Escarelle,25.0,91.0,"From an old vineyard on chalky soil, this wine has some concentration as well as a tight mineral texture. This is warm and ripe as well as fruity and crisp. It is a rich wine that has also retained crispness and great acidity. Drink from the end of 2017 or even early 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Hyland,25.0,91.0,"Old vines, ungrafted, comprise the core of this rich and sappy wine. It's definitely on the dry side, with a mix of peach flesh and skin, Meyer lemon, melon and vanilla. Drink now through 2025."
Syrah,Chile,Limarí Valley,Undurraga,25.0,91.0,"It's taken time, but Undurraga has finally hit paydirt with this Limarí Syrah. Cool, gritty aromas of black olive, herbs, asphalt, cassis and boysenberry are stacked and complex. This feels just plush enough, but with bracing acidity. Flavors of hard spices, pepper, wild herbs and leather blend with plum and berry notes prior to a savory, meaty, leathery finish. Drink through 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Von Schleinitz,25.0,91.0,"Dusty mineral and herb tones lend complexity to the plush, sunny peach and apricot in this bristling semidry Riesling. It's juicy and plump yet revitalizing and fresh, marked by tangerine acidity and a lacy fringe of sugar that lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2025."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Forgeron,25.0,91.0,"The blend includes 2% Muscat, an experiment that may not be repeated, though it worked quite well, boosting the aromatics and adding pretty floral notes at the top. The fruit is solidly anchored in citrus, pear and peach; and the barrels add a pleasing toastiness to the finish. There's a hint of anise as well. Lovely balance and fullness throughout."
Shiraz-Viognier,Australia,Victoria,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier,25.0,91.0,"Has the peripatetic Michel Chapoutier found his new Côte Rôtie? The aromas of this wine are simply intoxicating, combining peppery spice, raspberries and olives, while the flavors fold in bloody-meaty notes and blueberry fruit. Its remarkable complexity is packed onto a relatively light frame, with delicate, silky tannins suggesting early drinkability. Drink now–2012."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Bründlmayer,25.0,91.0,"Grapefruit zest, yeast and freshly cut kitchen herbs add to the enticing flavor of green pear on this light-footed, energetic wine. There is lots of drive, joy and ease. Yet there's nothing facile here—just the most nimble expression of clean-cut, refreshing Grüner."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Cenyth,25.0,91.0,"A partnership between Julia Jackson of Jackson Family Wines and Hélène Seillan, whose mentor is her father, Pierre Seillan of Vérité, this wine is lithe and complex, made from 100% Cabernet Franc, and shows plum and tangerine atop layered, pronounced acidity and a depth of weight that belies its lightness of being."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine du Grand Cros,25.0,91.0,"This is a rich wine, full bodied and packed with fruit. Ripe red-berry flavors are just touched by pepper and spice. It comes from selected parcels in the Faulkner family's estate, giving a concentrated, dense wine that will work best with food."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Elena Walch,25.0,91.0,"White spring blossom, orchard fruit and a whiff of Alpine herb come together on this delicious, structured white. The juicy, full-bodied palate offers white peach, mature pear and tangerine alongside bright acidity that lifts the creamy flavors. A precise mineral note closes the lingering finish and lends finesse."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Tyrrell's,25.0,91.0,"This is meant to provide a counterpoint to the Tyrrell family's Hunter Valley offerings, but it retains similar sensibilities. It's a medium-weight, crisp Shiraz that features a slight herbal tinge to notes of cracked pepper and red raspberries. It finishes bright and lively; drink now–2025."
Rosé,US,California,Comartin,25.0,91.0,"In honor of Adam Comartin's daughter, who's named after the Australian city where he learned a bit of winemaking, this bubblegum pink wine offers plush and inviting aromas of light strawberry, peach skins and watermelon juice. Rounded pink and red fruits show on the palate, cut by orange zest, packed up with edgy acid and grippy tension. Quite complex."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fritz,25.0,91.0,"Integrated and low in oak, this bright, clean and refreshing white doesn't skimp on body or texture. Lemon and lime rind play off toasted almond and apple crisp for a satisfying seesaw of savory and succulent."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Pierre Morin,25.0,91.0,"This wine comes from the two districts of Bué and Sancerre, from vines that are between 30 and 60 years old. A blend of richness and a tight mineral structure, it is a firm wine, full of white fruit and likely to age well. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Paul Dolan,25.0,91.0,"This is serious and concentrated, probably built to age a few more years before its peak. It smells soaked with black cherry and black currant aromas, tastes deep, ripe and compelling, and feels full bodied and firmly tannic. The flavors are powerful enough to match the big texture, so it should improve through 2020."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Josef Ehmoser,25.0,91.0,"Subtle hints of green pear meet yeasty pepperiness head-on. The palate is focused and concentrated and has a spine that tingles with crisp acidity and more pepper. This is inviting, moreish and very drinkable despite its comparative seriousness. Pepper and zest linger."
Syrah,US,Washington,McCrea,25.0,91.0,"A full six years old, this wine is in a sweet spot, with aromas of fresh and dried blue and red fruit. It's rich in style with plump, luscious fruit flavors. It still has time but it's hard to imagine it could get much better. Drink now."
Cinsault,US,California,Michael David,25.0,91.0,"This almost delicate wine has wonderful light cherry and floral aromas, pure and vivid raspberry and red cherry flavors and a texture as smooth as silk. A rarity made from old vines, its medium body balances nicely with ample acidity, mild tannins and a lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Rodney Strong,25.0,91.0,"This fine new offering is whimsically packaged with a screw cap and a floral label. That spirit is further evidenced by the wine's pretty pink color and subdued, light building of flavor, highlighted by orange, peach and strawberry notes and a substantial bite of mouthwatering acidity."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Wittmann,25.0,91.0,"Fresh tangerine and lemon aromas turn a shade riper on the palate of this approachable but elegant dry Riesling. It's luscious and mouthfilling, brightened by tart lime and grapefruit acidity that extends through a long finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Coyote Canyon,25.0,91.0,"A blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre, it's an immediately appealing wine with notes of coffee, black olive, blueberry and smoked meat. There's a pleasing texture and richness running from head to tail with coffee and chocolate flavors that linger on the finish."
Barbera,US,California,Oak Farm,25.0,91.0,"Alluring toast and spice aromas lead to bright red cherry and raspberry flavors that are well accented by oak flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper. The wine has good complexity combined with a firm and appetizing texture due to moderate tannins and acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Chantemerle,25.0,91.0,"This wine is full of all the right elements, from juicy acidity to black currant fruit and a supporting layer of tannins. It has weight, concentration and delicious spice and berry flavors. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Gauthier,25.0,91.0,"Eucalyptus aromas add to the ripe fruit in this wine to give both structure and fine potential. With its black plum flavors, rich texture and warm character, it's impressive and ready to age. Drink from 2020."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Barrister,25.0,91.0,"The fruit is perfectly ripe and succulent, a juicy mix of berries and black cherries. It's set against firm but ripe and polished tannins, which provide muscle and add some spice as well. The oak contributes just the right level of toast, not too heavy. The exceptional, sweet and tasty fruit takes the center stage, while the pretty oak flavors do the final curtain call."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Vinum Ferus,25.0,91.0,"An inviting plum color, this continues with plummy fruit, accented with tart flavors of Meyer lemon, Satsuma mandarin and nectarine. Fermented on the skins for a full week, then aged in neutral French barrels, it exhibits a discreet suggestion of toast as it winds down. An all-around excellent bottle of rosé, with the body and power to accompany a winter's roast chicken."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,American Thread,25.0,91.0,"Fermented in stainless steel, this is a pretty wine, with a darker tint of pinkish-orange color. Tangy peach and lime provide a crisp, clear and light-bodied experience atop persistent acidity and texture."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ken Wright,25.0,91.0,"Ken Wright produces as many as a dozen or more single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine is blended from many of those same sites, whose vines were often planted back in the 1980s. It's light and elegant, yet powerfully flavorful, with strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit pushing deep into the palate. It's clean and fresh, with crisp defining acidity, perfect balance, refined tannins and a long finish. Best of all, it's widely available."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,La Braccesca,25.0,91.0,"Wild berry, tilled earth, new leather and truffle aromas lead the nose of this vibrant red. The linear palate offers tart cherry, cranberry, white pepper and clove flavors, framed by tightly wound, polished tannins and firm acidity. Give it time to fully come together. Drink 2020–2033."
Syrah,US,California,Wrath,25.0,91.0,"Winemaker Sabrine Rodem strips wines down to their essence in her Ex Anima line, showing the savory side of this cool-climate Syrah. Black peppercorn, rosemary, cola and blueberry aromas show on the nose, while the palate packs cracked pepper, ripe olallieberry and dried beef flavors with tarry tension."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,OS Winery,25.0,91.0,"This wine explores the variety's savory side, with aromas of fresh herbs, green pepper and dried tobacco followed by flowers and cherry. It brings suppleness and richness of flavor but also exceptionally well-balanced acidity with length to match, with cedar notes on the finish."
Syrah,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Cypress,25.0,91.0,"Blueberries and spice—think baking spices and cracked pepper—mingle easily in this medium-bodied, velvety-textured Syrah. Vanilla oak makes an appearance as well, but overall the wine is savory, with ample spice and structure. Drink now–2020."
White Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,25.0,91.0,"Dominated by the local Loin de l'Oeil grape, this wood-aged wine has flavors of pears, spice and attractive, light vanilla. Acidity and a delicious, tasty structure give complexity to this wine that could certainly age. Drink now, although it will be better from 2016."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château du Port,25.0,91.0,"On one of the high terraces above the river Lot, Château du Port produces a highly structured wine. It is full of tannins as much as fruit, with a dark, firm character that brings out the potential of this concentrated wine. Drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,CARM,25.0,91.0,"The Côa valley is at the remote eastern end of the Douro. The wine revels in its firm, mineral, structured character, with acidity, spice and a dry center. There is weight, richness and the potential for aging."
Pinot Blanc,Germany,Baden,Franz Keller,25.0,91.0,"Alluring honeysuckle notes accent aromas of fresh apples and pears in this unusually blossomy Pinot Blanc. Floral notes penetrate through the palate as well, adding exuberance to flavors of white peaches and yellow cherries. Dry in style, with a bold, expansive mouthfeel, it's elegant and superbly satisfying."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Vidigal,25.0,91.0,"Strong wood aromas continue to the palate of this firm, dry wine. Underneath, there is enough juicy fruit to bring richness as well as structure. It still needs time. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Saviah,25.0,91.0,"Sourced as previously from the Stillwater Creek vineyard, this is a substantial, mouth-filling Chardonnay. At first tight and aggressively oaky, it softens up with air time and reveals hidden complexity. Lanolin, vanilla custard, lemon meringue and a mix of stone and tropical fruits keep it interesting. This is a Chardonnay that could improve for another five years or more."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Berberana,25.0,91.0,"Mature, solid and alluring on the bouquet, with cigar box, dried leaves, citrus peel and mature berry fruit aromas. Stylish, lifted and fresh in the mouth, with herb, tobacco, caramel and dried fruit flavors. Composed throughout, with coffee and mocha on the finish. Drink now through 2014."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Castillo Clavijo,25.0,91.0,"Rusty to the eye, then dry, spicy and elegant on the nose in a traditional manner. Focused and crisp in the mouth, with juicy currant and cherry flavors sweetened by cocoa. Long and remains bright on the finish. Drink this classy wine now through 2014."
Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Château Pesquié,25.0,91.0,"This blend of 80% Roussanne and 20% Clairette is rich and round, sumptuous and honeyed. It's largely barrel fermented, and carries a hint of tannin through the finish, which actually helps balance out the wine's lushness. Drink now."
Pinotage,South Africa,Wellington,Diemersfontein,25.0,91.0,"A beautiful Pinotage with superb expression and balance. Intriguing aromas of spicy cured meat, pepper, raw vanilla bean and mulled boysenberry abound, while the lush mouth offers concentrated dark fruit flavors of plum preserves and berry pie filling. Enjoyable now thanks to a creamy texture and silk tannins, though this wine also shows the potential to cellar for another 3–5 years."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Le Morette,25.0,91.0,"It opens with fragrances of stone fruit, Granny Smith apple and white almonds. The succulent palate delivers juicy pear, white peach, nutmeg, white almond and mineral alongside crisp acidity. It's nicely balanced with great length and finesse."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Fabrice Larochette,25.0,91.0,"While this domaine is based in Chaintré it also has vines in Pouilly-Fuissé. This wine comes from a 2.4-acre vineyard on the clay and chalk soil that marks this appellation. It is rich, full in the mouth with a mineral texture and lively acidity. It is still young and will be better from late 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Levendi,25.0,91.0,"This is a Pinot-based refresher with substantial body, dry and tart with streaks of cranberry and raspberry. The stand-out character comes from its savory element of spice and sea spray, in addition to the weightiness that makes it welcome with food."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Rui Roboredo Madeira,25.0,91.0,"Dominated by Touriga Nacional (70%), this is a dark-hued, beautifully perfumed wine. Still young and dense with tannins and very fresh black currant fruits, it is a wine that will develop slowly. The oak aging has smoothed the corners of the fruit, bringing out spice and enhancing the firm texture. Drink from 2018."
White Blend,US,Washington,Brian Carter Cellars,25.0,91.0,"An aromatic blend of 46% Viognier, 37% Roussanne, 17% Riesling, this bears complex scents and flavors of oranges and apricots, which are joined by notes of grapefruit and melon, and complemented with juicy acidity. One-third was barrel fermented in neutral oak, and a portion was left on its lees for added texture."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Seven Hills,25.0,91.0,"Still young, steely and firm, but classy and deep. This has the best attributes of the '05 and '06 Columbia Valley Cabs from Seven Hills—ripe and polished black fruits, firm tannins, a supple finish with a veneer of smoke and licorice. In other words, this is a complete, complex and intriguing Bordeaux blend, with plenty of aging potential."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Beast,25.0,91.0,"Fragrant and plush aromas of cassis, blueberry and black cherry mix with strong notes of licorice and black olive. Silky, detailed, supple and beautifully proportioned, this is a terrific value."
Syrah,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Luca,25.0,91.0,"Violet, black cherry and berry aromas are elevated by mocha and coffee aromas, while the palate is deep and layered. Flavors of boysenberry and plum are creamy and rewarding, and the finish offers plenty of fruit in addition to oak. Maybe not super complex, but the wine's bold meatiness makes up for that. 1,000 cases produced."
Grenache Blanc,US,Washington,Callan,25.0,91.0,"This is an impressive wine from a new producer. It's aromatically expressive in notes of ripe apple, star fruit and pear, with lemon-pith accents. The melon and citrus flavors are rounded, fresh and clean, offering a great balance of acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Roc,25.0,91.0,"This wine's juicy fruit and ripe tannins show it's full of potential. Firm now, it has rich black fruit and perfumed wood flavors that will soften with time. Drink from 2021."
Zinfandel,US,California,Quivira,25.0,91.0,"Spicy, tangy and tart, this well-made wine is softly layered and complex—a moderate and balanced version of the variety that shows cranberry and red-cherry goodness dotted in cinnamon and black pepper."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,North by Northwest,25.0,91.0,"NxNW makes much less of its Walla Walla Cabernet than of its Columbia Valley bottling, though both wear the same price tag. This is the one to find—a deep, dark wine rife with smoke and espresso. Black cherry and cassis fruit—equally dark and quite thrilling—carries the center into a rich, ripe finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Elevation Cellars,25.0,91.0,"Earth and olive streaks wrap around tight, compact fruit flavors of berry and plum. The aging in French oak—60% new—adds a light touch of spice without dominating. The tannins are clean, crisp and gently powdery."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Olsen Estates,25.0,91.0,"A wonderful follow-up to the debut vintage, this generous Chardonnay brings green apples, stone fruits and suggestions of pineapple, with a judicious use of new oak that refrains from becoming more than a pleasing nuance. Excellent balance, with a firm, lingering finish that brings in butterscotch and ripe, sweet lemon."
Red Blend,Moldova,Moldova,Purcari,25.0,91.0,"Bright ruby in the glass, this wine is a blend of the Bastardo grape with indigenous varieties Saperavi and Rara Neagra. It offers a fruit-forward bouquet of cherry and blackberry. On the palate, flavors of freshly picked plum and black cherry with a touch of green pepper are sheathed in a lattice of supple tannins."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Villa Bel Air,25.0,91.0,"Great style here, a wine that sums up the white 2007 vintage's freshness well. On that is built a discreet structure of yellow fruits, pears, kiwi and spice from wood. Behind is the fresh herbaceous acidity of young Sémillon. Age for 2–3 years."
Syrah,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,Lapostolle,25.0,91.0,"Exotic, attractive aromas of blueberry, cardamom and sandalwood get this Syrah off on the right foot. It feels concentrated and jacked up, with fully ripe, creamy flavors of blackberry, cassis and pastry. This is a chewy, layered, dense and jammy New World Syrah ready to drink now–2014."
Kerner,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,25.0,91.0,"Fragrant and polished, this radiant wine offers enticing scents of elderflower, yellow peach and aromatic herb. The elegantly structured palate delivers apricot, nectarine zest and a hint of white pepper, all framed in vibrant acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Patrice Moreux,25.0,91.0,This is a ripe and fat wine. That combination gives it a rich character and a full-bodied texture. The spice and the yellow fruits enhance the concentration and the generosity of this rounded wine. Drink now.
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Pascual Toso,25.0,91.0,"Aromas of tar and rubber give way to rich black fruits and toasty oak. A hard, tannic palate means this needs air or meaty foods. Oaky, resiny berry and cassis flavors finish chocolaty, with intense tannins. Drink through 2021."
Zinfandel,US,California,Paul Dolan,25.0,91.0,"Packed with juicy berry flavors, this outgoing wine blends great freshness and pure grape flavors with a lip-smacking texture of tannins and acidity that keep it well balanced. It resembles black berry, raspberry and boysenberry juices, has a tangy mouthfeel and lingering, tingly finish."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Woodinville Wine Cellars,25.0,91.0,"Designated unoaked, this flavorful Chardonnay proves the grape has more going on than its reputation suggests, when sourced from a great vineyard (such as Conner Lee) and carefully managed. Textural with melon, pear, apple and light tropical influences, this is long, complex and utterly delicious."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Judean Hills,Montefiore,25.0,91.0,"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of black plum and cherry with a touch of iodine. A network of gentle tannins provides the backdrop for flavors of black cherry, blueberry, cranberry, smoked meat, vanilla and lavender. There is a hint of smoke on the otherwise fruit-filled finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Taillan,25.0,91.0,"Owned by the Cruse family, part of the old Bordeaux elite, the estate is in the southern Médoc. The wine, with its firm character and rounded fruit, has weight and considerable richness. It will develop into a plush full-bodied wine. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Mersiol,25.0,91.0,"Maturity gives a bruised apple aroma to the generous mellowness of ripe pear on the nose. The palate is more taut than the nose leads you to expect, but there is concentration and richness and more bruised apple skin texture. Fruit, evolved flavors and freshness make for an intriguing wine. Drink soon."
Red Blend,US,California,Naggiar,25.0,91.0,"A classy, spicy oak aroma and very concentrated fruit flavors highlight this full-bodied and firmly tannic wine. It's so layered and saturated with delicious dark fruit that the impression stays on the tongue and palate for a long finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Board Track Racer,25.0,91.0,"This is a fluid, fruit-laden, well-balanced blend. Spicy and herbal purple fruits are highlighted with cayenne pepper, chocolate and a pleasing hint of violets."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château la Gordonne,25.0,91.0,"Complex and rich, it has ripe red fruits that are full of sweetness as well as some fresher acidity. With red plum, minerality and vanilla, it can age for a few months. Wait until 2015."
Fiano,Italy,Southern Italy,Mastroberardino,25.0,91.0,"It opens with intense honeysuckle, wisteria and jasmine aromas. The delicious palate delivers juicy peach, pear and green apple accented with aromatic herbs and energizing mineral alongside fresh acidity. It's nicely balanced with a lingering finish."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Weinrieder,25.0,91.0,"Crisp and perfumed, this shows white berries, crisp white stone fruit and a great twist of lemon zest. It's light, floating, the acidity like a whisper within the fresh flavors. The final acidity stays forever."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Cherrier et Fils,25.0,91.0,"A smooth, soft and full wine, rich in fruits and warm acidity. A touch of minerality expresses the chalk soil of the vineyard. Still dominated by young fruitiness, it will be better in 2015."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Rochemorin,25.0,91.0,"Full-bodied herbaceousness is the hallmark of this ripe wine. It offers great acidity while also having rich yellow and grapefruit fruits. Dense with fruits and acidity while also structured, this is a wine to age for a few years. Drink from 2017."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Aldonia,25.0,91.0,"Black-fruit aromas along with floral violet notes are draped all over the nose on this impressive mondern-styled Rioja. A juicy, zesty palate is acidic but offers enough body to handle it, while flavors of plum, berry and oaky vanilla and chocolate finish warm but fairly quick. Drink  through 2020."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Quady North,25.0,91.0,"Though this is just the first vintage from the estate vineyard's Viognier grapes, it is immensely satisfying, with juicy, rich, dense flavors of limoncello and tropical fruits. Peach and papaya, mango and pineapple, all sharply defined by just enough tangy acid."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,25.0,91.0,"Balance is what typifies all the latest Walla Walla Vintners's reds. Here, the grape's natural herbal highlights are linked to well modulated acids and tart rhubarb and berry fruit. Young and full of life and lift, this excellent Sangiovese should continue to improve for up to a decade."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Cellers Unió,25.0,91.0,"Schisty aromas of licorice and blackberry are touched up by a shot of cedary oak. This feels juicy and not that heavy or compact on the palate. Reedy, spicy plum and blackberry flavors come with lemony oak notes. This is toasty and spicy on the finish, with a spot of licorice. Drink through 2022."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Cepa 21,25.0,91.0,"Black-fruit aromas are made more complex by notes of leather and oak. This is full, blocky and tannic on the palate, with dark-fruit flavors of black plum and blackberry touched up by oak. A woody but long finish suggests that this will find its prime in a couple of years; drink through 2024."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Anselmo Mendes,25.0,91.0,"The family vineyards of consultant Anselmo Mendes are in the north of the Vinho Verde region the home of Alvarinho, so it's no surprise that this wine is a great interpetation of the grape. It is almost luscious in its intensity and richness. Orange, ripe apple and intense citrus flavors are encased in a generous, full-bodied wine. Drink now, although this wine will be even better from 2017."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Hyland,25.0,91.0,"A delightful, dry, citrusy Gewürztraminer, with a mix of dried rind and lightly candied fruit flavors. Lemon-lime and tangerine, a wash of rose water, and a balanced, elegant style, mark this as special."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château de Gaudou,25.0,91.0,"Dominated by wood and spice, this is still a wine in progress. It has the weight of black fruit, dark tannins and licorice, while chocolate flavors promise a wine that will age over the long-term. For now, wait and don't drink this powerful wine before 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Felsner,25.0,91.0,"A hugely-rich wine that is very concentrated, offering as much pepper flavor as fruit. With its weight and soft, velvety texture, there are notes of ripe yellow fruit and pear. This should age over several years. Screwcap."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Caves Aliança,25.0,91.0,"This fine wine has firm tannins and a solid feel from serious wood aging. The toast and spice flavors merge with the black fruits, the dark plums and the rich texture of this ripe wine. It is still young, needing further aging to soften those tannins. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château L'Escadre,25.0,91.0,"This wine is ripe and juicy, with delicious damson and berry fruit. Being rich and full bodied, it's also densely textured, with smoky touches of wood from barrel aging. Drink from 2020."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,J. Portugal Ramos,25.0,91.0,"A barrel-aged Alvarinho, but one that is so delicately toasty that the fruit is what this ripe generous wine is all about. It is rich with citrus and pear flavors, zesty and tangy while also having room for a round ripe aftertaste. This is an impressive wine, ready to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,South Africa,Stellenbosch,DeMorgenzon,25.0,91.0,"This Bordeaux-style blend, made from 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Malbec, 16% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc, is a complex and layered wine. Pleasant green notes of savory herbs, peppercorn, blackcurrant leaf and brambly berry drive the bouquet, while the medium-weight palate offers flavors of black-fruit skin, char and cigar box all framed by a crushed-velvet texture. It shows good grip, concentration and length, and should drink well through 2021."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Broadley,25.0,91.0,"Broadley offers well-ripened, estate-grown Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at affordable prices. This juicy, concentrated cuvée brings a lively mix of boysenberry, blackberry and black cherry. It was aged for one year in one-year-old French oak. The focus, concentration and sheer pleasure cannot by overstated."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Garricq,25.0,91.0,"This is a small property under the same ownership as Château Paloumey. It is unusual in the 20% Petit Verdot that goes into the blend. That gives the wine its deep color and rich generous black-plum fruit. Solid and dense, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,de Lancellotti,25.0,91.0,"This outstanding value is sharp and precise, its black-cherry fruit holding down a compact core, annotated with streaks of coffee, truffle and chocolate. It punches well above its price, and should drink nicely into the early 2020s."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,25.0,91.0,"Zesty lemon and lime acidity takes center stage in this invigorating medium-dry kabinett. It's leaner and more linear than the producer's regular-label kabinett, but offers loads of cutting white grapefruit and red apple flavors. The finish is refreshing and penetrating, lingering on a note of sugar cookie."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,25.0,91.0,"Hints of lanolin and beeswax lend a luxurious slick to this delicately framed yet remarkably complex medium-sweet wine. White peach and pineapple flavors are luscious and ripe, but pierced with a streak of lime acidity and steely minerality. It finishes long with a swathe of fresh green herbs and lime zest."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Baden,Franz Keller,25.0,91.0,"Fresh cherry blossoms and cranberries breathe zest into luscious notes of preserved black cherry, sweet beets and earth in this ruddy, ripe and yet complex Pinot Noir. Dense on the palate and framed in baby-soft tannins, it's enjoyable now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,San Simeon,25.0,91.0,"Dark chocolate and black cherry converge for an elegant and dense nose in this wine from the Riboli family.

Chardonnay,Australia,South Australia,Sidewood,25.0,91.0,"This silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,25.0,91.0,"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Walla Walla Vintners,25.0,91.0,"This is Walla Walla Vintners' signature wine, and it is a classic: rich and oaky, sculpted but also chewy, with big cherry and baking chocolate flavors. There is an unusual flavor streak running through that tastes a bit like Thanksgiving turkey, believe it or not, but it's good. Tannins are polished and the toffee and chocolate finish ends things on a sweet and creamy note."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Cambria,25.0,91.0,"This single-vineyard selection from the Jackson Family's Santa Maria Valley winery kicks off with scents ranging from red, blistered tomato to pomegranate reduction and mole sauce.

The rich palate offers juicy black cherry and red raspberry accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon clove and cocoa alongside bracing tannins. It closes on a note of black licorice. Drink 2020–2030."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaines Dominique Piron,25.0,91.0,"Produced by Dominique Piron in association with the Lameloise family, this wine from strong granite soil reveals a firm texture and dense tannins. The fruit suggests very ripe, concentrated black plums and damsons. It is wine to age, drink from 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lynmar,25.0,91.0,"This wine sings in the glass, offering substantial aromas and flavors of charcuterie, dried herb and orange creamsicle, conjuring up visions of picnics in a glass. It will do well in such settings, but is also a worthy addition to the table, balanced and structured to pair memorably with a wide range of foods."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta das Marias,25.0,91.0,"A rich, full-bodied, yet also elegant wine that is ripe and mature. A selection of the best lots, it has spice, rich red plum and generous texture. Drink now."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Luiano,25.0,91.0,"This savory wine opens with aromas of violet, red rose, wet soil, woodland berries and a whiff of Mediterranean herbs. The fresh, inviting palate doles out juicy dark cherry accented with hints of cracked black pepper, sage and clove. It's straightforward, balanced and enjoyable now but will drink well for through 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Upper Galilee,Binyamina,25.0,91.0,"Dark red violet in color, this wine has aromas of cherry, lavender and rose petal. It is a well-balanced wine with flavors of black cherry, raspberry, Turkish delight and herbes de Provence. Silky tannins coat the palate into the lasting finish, which is punctuated by a note of bright cherry."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Winzer Krems,25.0,91.0,"An intense wine that has powered, nervy acidity, lots of citrus with lime zest. The wine is still young and should be aged to become an impressive Riesling."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Ronco Blanchis,25.0,91.0,"Classic varietal aromas of hay, tomato vine and tropical fruit take center stage in this expressive white, accented with a whiff of wet stone. The savory palate doles out juicy grapefruit, green melon, yellow peach and mineral flavors, with tangy acidity."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Central Otago,Mud House,25.0,91.0,"Made from fruit that was sourced from Central Otago's Bendigo subregion, this is a ripe and concentrated wine that still manages to show a surprising degree of elegance on the finish. Black cherry fruit is framed by maple syrup and brown sugar timbering. The wine seems chunky and full at first, but it smooths out and turns supple by the finish. It should drink well for the next five years or more."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Minho,Quinta da Soalheiro,25.0,91.0,"This is a ripe, tropical take on Alvarinho. The effects of partial malolactic fermentation in wood are there in the round, creamy character of the wine and the lights touch of oak. It is all ready to drink although it will be even better from late 2016."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Wolf Blass,25.0,91.0,"An excellent value, the 2008 Gold Label Shiraz is a full-bodied, powerfully built wine, filled out by cassis, chocolate and tobacco flavors. It's long and velvety on the finish, not just an upfront powerhouse. Drink now–2020."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Emilio Moro,25.0,91.0,"Rooty, earthy aromas of cola, baking spices, blackberry and pepper are potent and ripe. Like always, this is a generous, well-balanced example of Ribera del Duero with toasty oak flavors riding on top of baking spice, plum and cassis notes. Vanilla and mint flavors on the finish are oak-based, while modest heat and burn call for short-term aging. Drink through 2019."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,25.0,91.0,"Located on high ground to the east of Cahors, this estate was replanted in the 1980s at a high density. Rich, smooth and dense, this shows concentrated ripe plum and juicy blackberry flavors and, above all, firm tannins. Wood aging has smoothed the rough edges."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Judean Hills,1848 Winery,25.0,91.0,"Inky red violet in the glass, this wine features aromas of raspberry, vanilla and violet. Ever-present tannins form a backdrop for flavors of blackberry, ripe summer cherry, vanilla and black pepper that are heightened by opulent floral notes. The finish offers a pleasing amalgam of rose petal and cherry pie."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Berceo,25.0,91.0,"Raw oak, herb and floral aromas are complex and on the light side of the fence. This feels tight, tannic and edgy, while resiny oak gives off a lactic flavor to accompany core red plum and currant. This stays tight, punchy and drying on the finish. Drink through 2021."
Chardonnay,US,California,MacRostie,25.0,91.0,"The largest production offering of this variety for this producer, this features fruit sourced from a who's who of local growers, including Sangiacomo, Dutton and Martinelli, in addition to the estate-run Wildcat Mountain Vineyard. The result is satisfyingly impressive in viscous oak, graham cracker and Meyer lemon. Tangy and flinty on the finish, it's smooth and focused."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ponzi,25.0,91.0,"Who puts their lowest-priced Pinot Noir in 20% new French oak, and includes fruit from their best vineyards in the blend? Ponzi does, and the result is a terrific vintage for Tavola. Bright, compact, aromatic and lushly fruited with plum and black cherry, this is a stunning value. Cola, caramel and cinnamon spice add further details and highlights."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Obrigado,25.0,91.0,"The Dão's very own Encruzado is the backbone of this beautiful fresh wine. Made by top winemaker Alvaro Castro, the wine is rich, full of pears, apricots and pears with a touch of nutmeg. It needs another year to age. Drink from early 2016."
Red Blend,Italy,Central Italy,Antonelli,25.0,91.0,"Vibrant and savory, this blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot delivers succulent black cherry, crushed plum, black pepper, grilled herb and mocha flavors alongside firm but velvety tannins. It's well balanced with surprisingly fresh acidity for the hot vintage. It's already drinking well but will be even better after 2016."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Lauren Ashton Cellars,25.0,91.0,"Leesy and nicely textured, this has lime and green apple notes that rest on a bed of bracing acidity. It has length, focus and detail, all without intrusive new oak—just a small percentage of the wine was barrel-fermented."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Hestia Cellars,25.0,91.0,"This Meritage red is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, and 15% Petit Verdot. There are noticeable high toned aromas hinting at nail polish. The fruit is bright cherry and darker black currant, with milk chocolate coating the finish. The wine is still tightly wound and opens very slowly, so decanting is recommended."
Riesling,US,New York,Damiani,25.0,91.0,"While demure on the nose, this dry Riesling offers a palate that is surprisingly bold in both flavor and textural intensity. Bursts of ripe grapefruit and tangerine flavors are accented by a kiss of rose-petal perfume. Zesty orange-peel notes lend a touch of astringency to the finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Richard Rottiers,25.0,91.0,"Smoky wine, rich as well as structured. The acidity of the year is integrated into the structure, the firm tannins and juicy red berry fruits a balanced pleasure to taste."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Vall Llach,25.0,91.0,"Rubbery and gaseous on first sniff, and then upon airing it shows pretty black fruit scents and richness. Forget about minerality and llicorela here; this wine is modern, lusty, big and dark, with licorice, blackberry and chocolaty flavors. Finishes thick, long and tasty."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Vincent Vatan,25.0,91.0,"Very mineral and textured from the limestone soil, this is a concentrated and complex wine. It boasts considerable acidity and very crisp fruit, with grapefruit and juicy lemons coming through strongly. Age until at least 2016."
Chardonnay,US,California,La Chertosa,25.0,91.0,"Waxy pear and white plum provide the fruit-forward flavors of this wine, which exhibits plenty of minerality on the midpalate before offering a wave of richness and vanilla cream. The finish finds a focus and balance between these two ends, ending light and bright."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Mas del Périé,25.0,91.0,"With the richness of the vintage in mind, this wine makes a powerfully extravagant statement. There is nothing subdued about the concentrated tannins or the intensely rich black fruits. Even with 3–4 years aging, this will still be a bold wine."
Shiraz,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Radford Dale,25.0,91.0,"A vibrant, fresh, violet petal and orange oil streak cuts through the overall heavy character of this wine. Brimming with black cherry, plum skin and blueberry fruit aromas and flavors, the palate is big and gripping with an earthy black tea leaf- and spicy-bark flavored finish that lingers nicely. Drink now–2015."
Red Blend,South Africa,Western Cape,Warwick,25.0,91.0,"This gorgeous Cape blend, made from 30% Pinotage, 31% Syrah, 30% Cab Sauv and 3% Mourvèdre, is ripe and immediately enticing on the nose with aromas of crushed Thin Mint cookies and iris petals mingling perfectly with the blackberry, blueberry and fig fruit core. Well balanced and firmly structured with a spicy, lingering finish."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Mas del Périé,25.0,91.0,"Dense and almost black in color, this is concentrated, with intense tannins and black plum fruit. It bursts with the rich fruit and acidity, finishing on a smoky, juicy note."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ghost Hill,25.0,91.0,"Stainless-steel fermented and the color of wheat, this still white wine is stylish and compelling. If you've wondered why anyone would bother to make a white Pinot Noir, this is the answer. It's fragrant with sweet grass and melon, then the flavors follow along with grapefruit and kiwi."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,25.0,91.0,"A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass. The palate is bright and just thick enough, with wild berry, cherry, plum and oak-based flavors. Another whack of oak, along with vanilla, chocolate and tobacco flavors, graces the finish. Drink now–2015."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Bucelas,Companhia das Quintas,25.0,91.0,"Wood-aged, this is a ripe-textured wine that has rich flavors of yellow and white fruits and toast. It has concentrated, intense fruit that bursts in the mouth. Delicious and impressive, this could be aged for another two years."
Chardonnay,Portugal,Duriense,Real Companhia Velha,25.0,91.0,"A wood-aged Chardonnay from mountain vineyards above the Douro. The wine has spice, yellow fruits and a strong toast character. Acidity is there to add some freshness to the concentrated, rounded taste."
Riesling,Canada,British Columbia,Tantalus Vineyards,25.0,91.0,"This Riesling specialist strikes a unique chord, with precise yet individualistic wines. Crisp, tart, tongue-tickling flavors of green apple, grapefruit and orange peel are among the penetrating highlights. Concentrated and high in acid, this rocks on through a long finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Gassier,25.0,91.0,"This wine has an herbal aroma and a crisp palate that delivers tropical fruits cut by grapefruit. The wine comes from the privileged Mont Saint-Victoire vineyards, named after the path that runs along the south side of the mountain. It has a distinctly mineral texture and perfumed acidity. At the end, the wine is bright, tight and crisp."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Mas Igneus,25.0,91.0,"This is deep and fruity up front, with blackberry and cola aromas that come with creamy oak and offsetting minerality. Full and jammy on the palate, with flavors of blackberry, fine herbs and lightly applied molasses. Round and concentrated on the finish. Drink now through 2016."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Lusco,25.0,91.0,"This is Albariño in fine form. The nose is succulent and marble-smooth, with pure citrus and melon aromas. The palate is lively but refined, with exuberant citrus flavors that come on strong but with proper restraint. Long and ripe on the finish, which only adds to the experience. Drink now."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Bestheim,25.0,91.0,Honeyed ripe pear fruit fills the nose. The palate amplifies this rich notion even more with a generous touch of residual sweetness that bathes the pear fruit in caramel richness. There is a glint of pleasant phenolic bitterness here and there but the pear fruit conquers all. This is rich but fresh with a medium-sweet finish ideal for blue cheese.
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Case Paolin,25.0,91.0,"Fragrant yellow flower, crushed thyme, Bartlett pear and citrus aromas carry over to the dry vibrant palate together with green apple and crisp acidity. Small, continuous bubbles lend finesse."
Port,Portugal,Port,Quinta do Infantado,25.0,91.0,"This is a dense, smooth wine with fine tannins and rich fruit. It has concentration, with suggestions of bitter extraction that need to soften. The structure and the fruit are still young, so wait to drink this powerful wine until 2018."
Red Blend,US,California,Lynch Wines,25.0,91.0,"Savory, smoky, sagey and floral, this wild and remarkable rendition of a Rhône-style blend is made from 50% Mourvèdre plus Syrah, Grenache and Counoise. Aromas recall grilled herbs and stewed berries, while flavors bring out sour cherry, chocolate and beef broth. It's full in body, with a firm and tannic texture."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Baron de l'Ecluse,25.0,91.0,This is an ageworthy wine from 60-year-old vines. There is a fine structure that offers rich tannins and equally rich black plum fruits. It is worth keeping this finely structured cru wine to allow its tannins to integrate and soften. Drink from 2018.
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine du Vissoux,25.0,91.0,"One of a series of single parcel wines from the Chermette family estate, this is dark and rich. It has generous tannins alongside the dark cherry and plum fruit. The cru wine's structure and richness will allow it to age. Drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Dürnberg,25.0,91.0,The nose is almost closed but the palate paints a subtle picture of toned-down intensity. A savory core is made mellow with lees and a slight oak influence that becomes more apparent on the finish. Fruit—pear and yellow plum—plays second fiddle to the yeasty midpalate.
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Fillaboa,25.0,91.0,"Peach and floral aromas are ethereal and reach out. This is round and full on the palate, but minerally and cut by citric acidity. Flavors or orange, mango and caramel end with ripe peach and melon flavors. Drink through 2016."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Nigl,25.0,91.0,"At first there is the juiciness of freshly cut green pear, then there is an explosion of white pepper bedded in yeasty softness. Framed by citrus and more green pear fruit, the pepper just continues to delight on the concentrated core. Lovely, full-flavored finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Stolo,25.0,91.0,"Extremely light in color save for a slight shade of pale pink, this awesome rose invites the nose with unique aromas of baked lemon and strawberry cream sauce, proving both delicate but richly layered. It's clean, crisp and quaffable on the palate, where lime rind and nectarine flesh make for a flavor profile that goes down like water."
Roussanne,US,California,Wellington,25.0,91.0,"Crisp and light with a sticky mouthfeel that fills up the palate with grace, this wine is abundantly floral and inviting in apricot and pear. Made in a medium-bodied style and 100% varietal, it has a slight undertone of herbal goodness buoying the ripeness of the fruit."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Lange,25.0,91.0,"This is an outstanding value, offering rich and complex varietal character. Raspberry and cherry fruit comes with a vein of licorice, and the texture and depth emulate Willamette Valley Pinots selling for twice the cost."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Sandeman,25.0,91.0,"Quite the classic, with rich toffee and nut-like aromas that come through with piercing power. The briny palate is all about dried citrus and nuts, while the earthy, long finish has an unmistakable and very nice mushroom quality. This is a precise, somewhat reserved and dainty amontillado, but it's structured and quite real as far as style and impact."
Red Blend,US,California,Hunter DeHaven,25.0,91.0,"Meaty, smoky aromas and equally meaty, smoky, peppery flavors give an untamed personality to this full-bodied blend made with Syrah, Petite Sirah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and a touch of Viognier. An emphasis on savory elements clearly separates it from the pack of simply fruity wines, so it's a fun little adventure in a bottle."
Baco Noir,US,New York,Hudson-Chatham,25.0,91.0,"This perfumed floral red made from Baco Noir, an underappreciated French-American hybrid grape, offers surprising depth of complexity and finesse. Hints of dark char, porcini and spice mingle amidst prettier tones of violet and black cherry. It's crisp and lively on the palate, edged by layers of fine feathery tannins and a crush of granite on the finish. Ready to drink now, but tuck a few bottles away to enjoy from now until 2022 if you can."
Cabernet Franc,US,Oregon,Leah Jørgensen Cellars,25.0,91.0,"Deep purple/black in color, this wine carries varietal scents of violets and cassis, with fresh and focused flavors following. The mix of black cherry, black licorice, chalk and tobacco is complex and powerful, and that power and balance continue through the long finish."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Principe Corsini,25.0,91.0,"Smooth and juicy, this opens with aromas of wild berry, blue flower and a whiff of grilled herb. The soft, succulent palate doles out black cherry, chopped mint, cinnamon and a hint of mocha alongside dusty tannins and bright acidity. It's rather straightforward but delicious."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Epiphany,25.0,91.0,"Crisp and clean aromas of honeydew melon, lime peel and slate greet the nose on this zesty bottling of a tremendously promising grape for the Central Coast. The palate offers a creamy yellow-pear center, framed by fantastic citrus-zest acidity and Meyer lemon-pith grip, redolent with interesting texture and tension."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Eredi Enzo Raspi,25.0,91.0,"Wild berry, iris, tilled soil new leather and a whiff of Asian spice unfold on this radiant red. The palate has elegant structure and balance, offering black cherry, chopped mint and star anise framed in firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink from 2018–2023."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,25.0,91.0,"The 147-acre vineyard on a high chalk plateau in the east of Cahors was first planted in the Middle Ages. It has produced a structured, mineral wine, very textured and with firm, dusty tannins. Underneath the black currant fruits are developing and will give a fine juicy wine from 2019. Grands Vins de Seigneur is a group of growers who approve each other's wines."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Septima,25.0,91.0,"A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date."
Sauvignon Blanc,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tenuta San Leonardo,25.0,91.0,"This elegant but firmly structured white wine opens with an alluring fragrance of honeysuckle, exotic fruit and cantaloupe. The linear palate offers juicy white peach, apricot and mineral alongside crisp acidity."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Vivanco,25.0,91.0,"Spicy saucy red-berry aromas announce a flush palate that's more balanced than outright bullish. Flavors of wild berry, nutmeg, vanilla and chocolate finish lively, with good weight. Drink this delicious Reserva through 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Armida,25.0,91.0,"This white is blended with 20% Pinot Gris, making for an unusual, interestingly crisp and delightful wine. Stony minerality defines it more than fruitiness, which leans more into savory stone fruit and hazelnut. It offers length and breadth in a medium-sized body."
Viognier,US,California,Terre Rouge,25.0,91.0,"A pretty Viognier with oaky pear and apricot aromatics, lean, dry and crisp in style with plenty of depth on the finish that will appeal to fans of Condrieu. This wine will be available in 2013."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Amici,25.0,91.0,"This light, bright and remarkably floral white from the Musqué clone impresses in its balance and lingering mouthfeel. Subtle flavors of nectarine and peach invite one in and become more pronounced in the glass over time, providing refreshment and elegance."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Frankland Estate,25.0,91.0,"From a remote Western Australia region, this is a fine value. Ripe mulberries and cracked pepper mingle easily on the nose, picking up a hint of mint on the palate. It's medium to full in body, with a supple, creamy texture and a long silky finish."
Chardonnay,Germany,Pfalz,Fitz-Ritter,25.0,91.0,"Luscious and creamy in mouthfeel, this ripe, full-bodied Chardonnay showcases almost tropical flavors of mango, melon and quince. Hints of vanilla and sweet spice are integrated nicely, leaving a crisp, clean finish that's surprisingly mineral. Ready to drink now but should hold till 2020."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château la Varière,25.0,91.0,"Although this wine is labeled as dry, its honey and smooth apple character suggests a definite sweetness. Rich, full and concentrated, it brings in spice, ripe tropical fruits and just a touch of acidity at the end."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Trinity Vineyards,25.0,91.0,"This family-owned boutique winery is releasing some outstanding Pinots at modest prices. This saw 50% new French oak—the quality barrels put a toasty frame around juicy fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry. The scale, definition  and balance are exceptional for the price."
Pinot Noir,Chile,Aconcagua Valley,Errazuriz,25.0,91.0,"After an initial wave of briny rubbery aromas, this turns towards lively raspberry scents topped by toasty oak. Fresh and punchy in the mouth, with elegance, this tastes of red raspberry and herbal plum. A lightly salty finish with tomato and plum flavors is fresh and lasting."
Grenache Blanc,US,Washington,Two Vintners,25.0,91.0,"Blended with 25% Roussanne, this wine brings light aromas of straw, lees and spice. The palate is medium bodied, with tart lemony acidity followed by a lingering finish. It's perhaps the best example of this variety from the state to date."
Carmenère,Chile,Peumo,Undurraga,25.0,91.0,"Tight-grained oak, vanilla, graphite, plum and cassis aromas are attractive as a whole. This feels good but a bit tartaric and scratchy. Ripe black-fruit flavors are pure Peumo, while touches of licorice and chocolate add to the fun. A saturated finish tastes of blackberry, black currant and peppery spice. Drink through 2022."
Port,Portugal,Port,Poças,25.0,91.0,"Tasting mature for a 10-Year-Old tawny, this ripe wine has lost fruit but gained in spirit, wood and acidity. Balanced just right, it finishes dry and fragrant."
Moscatel,Spain,Andalucia,Jorge Ordóñez & Co.,25.0,91.0,"On this medium-bodied, sweet Moscatel, the tangerine peel and lychee aromas require airing to get beyond the basics. Mango, melon and lychee are the lead flavors, while the finish is peachy and easy, with richness but nothing cloying. Drink through 2018."
Riesling,US,New York,Standing Stone,25.0,91.0,"The crown jewel of the winery's ice-style wines, it's gorgeously aromatic with notes of tropical mango and pineapple adorned with honey and blossoms. Dripping with nectar and yellow peach preserves, it's lusciously sweet, yet impeccably balanced with acidity and an elegant mineral tone that lingers on the finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Margüi,25.0,91.0,"Full of fresh raspberries, laced with red cherries and given a lift by the acidity and minerality, it is both ripe and full of brightness."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Airfield Estates,25.0,91.0,"This wine is a blend of Syrah (45%), Mourvèdre (27%), Grenache (25%) and Cinsault. It charms with complex, pure aromas of boysenberry, white pepper, raspberries and herbs. The flavors are full in feel, with the judicious use of oak heightening the enjoyment."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,25.0,91.0,"Apricot, damask rose and earth frame this vivacious Gewurztraminer that benefits from 2014's verve. The palate comes with some of the characteristic viscosity but the zest of orange and lemon peel balances this out beautifully, creating a lovely, refreshing arc."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Pflüger,25.0,91.0,"Smoky mineral tones and a racy, acidic edge lend structure to this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Crisp green apple and lemon flavors are mouthwatering and juicy, leading to a pleasantly bitter lime pith finish. Enjoy now through 2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta de Vale Veados,25.0,91.0,"Smooth and ripe, this wine comes from vines planted in what was once a royal hunting ground. It is a full-bodied blend of Douro grapes with a more local southern variety, giving both structure and warmth. An impressively concentrated wine, it needs to age. Drink from 2019."
Rosé,US,California,Tablas Creek,25.0,91.0,"This is an extremely textural pink wine, with delicate touches of raspberry, strawberry, watermelon and the slightest twist of lime on the nose. The blend of 68% Grenache, 13% Counoise, 11% Mourvèdre and 8% Syrah shows grip and acidity on the sip, where lime-soaked nectarine and red apple flavors reign."
Viognier,US,California,Terre Rouge,25.0,91.0,"An exotic, inviting aroma like apricot and sliced almonds leads to complex and compelling flavors that seem European as they layer peach skin on pastry shell on something almost briny. It is a flavorful, dry, rich, but almost astringent wine with great energy."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,Garofoli,25.0,91.0,"Alluring aromas of acacia flower, beeswax, citrus and a whiff of honey float out of the glass. The elegant, linear palate offers green pear, grapefruit, lemon zest, almond and mineral framed in racy acidity. Give this time to fully develop. Drink through 2021."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château les Valentines,25.0,91.0,"The fuller rosé of the two made at Les Valentines, this is rich, balanced and dense in character. That makes it a serious wine, its acidity finely integrated into the red plum and orange zest flavors. It's a perfect food rosé."
Red Blend,Morocco,Morocco,Ouled Thaleb,25.0,91.0,"A blend of 50% Arinarnoa, 50% Tannat and 25% Malbec, this inky, garnet-colored wine has aromas of blackberry and brambles with a touch of green bell pepper. Flavors of cherry, blackberry, oregano, black olive and coffee make for a lively mix on the palate, backed by a core of chewy tannins. The fruit-laced finish has a savory kick of Kalamata olive and thyme."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château les Valentines,25.0,91.0,"Finely balanced wine, showing the warmth of 2009 as well as keeping bright peach, pink grapefruit and red berry fruit flavors. The wine shows lively final acidity for a delicious aftertaste."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alma de los Andes,25.0,91.0,"Smoky aromas of graphite, road tar and wild berry set up a wiry, full-force palate with a can't-miss beam of tartaric acidity. Blackberry and chocolaty flavors finish forward, with unabashed freshness and drive. Drink through 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,25.0,91.0,"Zesty limes and lemons brighten aromas of fresh pear on this irresistibly nimble-bodied Riesling. Ripe tangerine and peach flavors are semi-sweet on the palate, but zippy with acidity and a delicate fringe of minerals that lend complexity to the finish."
Moscatel Roxo,Portugal,Moscatel de Setúbal,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,25.0,91.0,"A perfumed Moscatel, it features spice, honeyed fruitiness and a strong spirit character. When it was bottled, it had just begun to exhibit the old-wood aging flavors and resulting acidity.it offers a delicious orange-peel aftertaste."
Pinot Gris,US,Washington,Cerulean,25.0,91.0,"Pale in color but rich in flavor, this offers a compelling mix of scents and flavors. Acacia flower, pink grapefruit and Honeycrisp apples lead into a delicious wine with excellent length, balance and texture. Drink now through 2020."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Belasco de Baquedano,25.0,91.0,"Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Boeckel,25.0,91.0,"Slenderness and light touch are apparent with the first sniff of fresh citrus blossom. The palate of this wine shows the full fruit of 2015 with pear, peach, orange and apple shimmering through. The soft, bouncy palate is super-clean, fresh and dry."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Battle of Bosworth,25.0,91.0,"The aromas carry with them a bright raspberry note, which adds amplitude to the other scents of peppery spice, while the flavors revolve around the same raspberry core, embellished with vanilla, pepper, clove and cinnamon. It's medium-bodied wine, with creamy-soft tannins, balanced acids and a lingering finish."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Vallana,25.0,91.0,"Structured and loaded with finesse, this opens with a bouquet of blue flower, perfumed red berry and a whiff of cake spice. The silky, focused palate delivers creamy red cherry, ripe raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mineral tones set in a framework of supple tannins. Drink through 2020."
Viognier,US,California,Peachy Canyon,25.0,91.0,"Tropical aromas of mango, banana and honeysuckle lead the nose on what first seems like a fruity wine. But then the palate is much more restrained, clean and mineral-driven, with steely flavors surrounding the remnant ripe plantain-like tropicality."
Red Blend,US,California,Redwood Ridge Estate,25.0,91.0,"The winery is owned by Candice Wozniak, ex-wife of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. This nontraditional blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir impresses, with aromas of ripe berries, wildfire and smoked herbs. The smoky palate picks up licorice, tobacco, cedar, asphalt and acai fruit, altogether reminiscent of a blueberry crusted pork roast."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Mário Braga,25.0,91.0,"Bottled in June 2009, nearly four years after harvest, this is a limited production wine. It has great structure, tannin and beautiful ripe fruits. With a perfumed black-currant character, it is ready to drink now, but its tannins suggest aging potential."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Te Awa,25.0,91.0,"A top-flight Cab-Merlot from Hawkes Bay, Te Awa's 2007 is loaded with plum and cassis, dressed up by elegant oak-derived notes of vanilla and baking spices. It's full-bodied, lush and layered in texture, with a long velvety finish. So good now, the only question is how long it will last. Drink now–2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Concannon,25.0,91.0,"With serious structure and a firm grip, this 100% Cabernet from Livermore's vaulty Concannon is a very impressive effort from a strong vintage that's easy drinking and well integrated, tasting great right now with plenty of rich tannins, pleasing blueberry and cassis with a shot of chocolate on the finish for good measure."
Rosé,US,California,Cornerstone,25.0,91.0,"Made from Syrah grapes with purpose, not as a saignée, this is an alluring wine, its aromatics exuberant in wild strawberry and rhubarb, with a pithy, textured vibe. With just the right amount of power and body, it's vibrant and yet has body and weight, retaining substance through the long finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Whitehall Lane,25.0,91.0,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot, this is soft and sublime. The Cab and Syrah influences charge through the dense, substantial tannins and meatier notes of leather, cigar box and oak."
White Blend,Italy,Central Italy,Castello della Sala,25.0,91.0,"Heady aromas of citrus blossom, tropical fruit and yellow stone fruit lead the way. The fresh, enjoyable palate doles out apricot, pineapple, nectarine and a hint of chopped herb alongside lively acidity."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weszeli,25.0,91.0,"The fulsome, ripe flavor of yellow Mirabelle plums beckons and is joined by peppery watercress notes and the zest of freshly grated lemon peel. Despite its slender, taut palate this has generous, joyful and appetizing fruit and an ultraclean finish. So moreish."
Red Blend,Spain,Spanish Islands,Ànima Negra,25.0,91.0,"Lightly roasted and stalky on the nose, this shows dry aromas of cherry and raspberry along with earthy spice notes. The palate offers proper balance and nothing complicated. Flavors of oak-driven spice, cinnamon and pepper accent earthy plum and berry, while the finish is smooth but a touch hot. Drink through 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mascota,25.0,91.0,"Lush, jammy, soft aromas of black plum and cassis are full but a touch lazy. On first take, this feels saturated but deeper examination reveals zesty tartaric acidity. Flavors of jammy black fruits are a touch citric, while this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is plump on the finish. Drink through 2020."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Mettler Family Vineyards,25.0,91.0,"For a wine from a sometimes rough-edged variety, this is especially smooth, sculpted and drinkable. That's not to deny that it's intense in color, full bodied and firm textured. But the tannins feel polished so the texture is smooth, letting ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors come out."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Forgeron,25.0,91.0,"The new vintage of Ambiance is again a blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc, from a trio of excellent vineyards. At first firm and phenolic, it opens up gracefully, with vivid flavors of candied orange peel, honeydew melon and apricot jam. Aging in neutral French oak helps to round out the animated flavors. Drink now and over the next two years."
Arinto,Portugal,Bucelas,Companhia das Quintas,25.0,91.0,"Wood-aged Arinto in the right hands, as here, gives an opulently ripe wine that hints at the richness of Chardonnay. Yellow fruit, pear skin and a touch of toast are beautifully combined to give a full and complex wine that can age. Drink from 2014."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Mettler Family Vineyards,25.0,91.0,"There is no mistaking the strong influence of new oak on this very deeply colored, full-bodied and flavor-saturated wine. It smells like toasted baguette slices and wood smoke and tastes almost like blackberry jam laced with cloves and black pepper. It's terrific fun to drink."
Chardonnay,US,California,Niner,25.0,91.0,"Light and delicate aromas of Gravenstein-apple custard and lemon curd grow a tad stronger with patience, delving into white peach, vanilla cream and a touch of bubblegum. There is solid textural tension on the palate, where Meyer lemon pith meets with cashew and browned butter flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Stephen Ross,25.0,91.0,"Steve Dooley has championed this region since 1994, and this appellation blend is another strong argument. Aromas of sour tangerines, tangy pear, sea salt and hints of quinine are leveled by the slightest touch of brown sugar on the nose. The palate is dusted lightly with vanilla and offers ripe cherimoya and pear-custard flavors, bound together by steely, crisp minerality."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Salomon-Undhof,25.0,91.0,"An aromatic nose suggests fresh green pear, a touch of yeast and both citrus flesh and foliage: think lemon and lime. The palate has a stonger impression of yeast, giving an almost-salty texture, with a bright lemon streak of freshness. It's taut, dry, slender and refreshing."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Jean Rijckaert,25.0,91.0,"This tangy, perfumed single-vineyard wine also has some ripe fruit. A zesty character dominates at this early stage, leaving room for richer yellow fruits to come through in time. The wine has good potential, so wait until 2017 to drink."
Riesling,US,Washington,Carmina Burana,25.0,91.0,"From Long Shadows, a rare, barrel-fermented Riesling. Sappy, tart, juicy and stylish, this is loaded with pear, grapefruit and Meyer lemon. The acidity is generous but softened up a bit by the extra oxygen from the fuder."
Marsanne,US,Washington,Darby,25.0,91.0,"Bee pollen, honey mead and lemon polish mingle in the bouquet; turning smooth and supple in the mouth. This is a rich and buttery wine, with excellent acidity behind the ripe fruit. The flavors gather strength as the wine pours over the tongue and down the back of the throat, finishing with a lick of butterscotch."
Merlot,US,Washington,Olsen Estates,25.0,91.0,"The best of Olsen's 2008 reds, this 100% Merlot is generous and forward, with rich cherry and raspberry fruit. Spicy in the nose and in the mouth, it is lightly herbal, adding texture and length, and has the concentration and depth to develop nicely over the next decade."
Chardonnay,US,California,Alma de Cattleya,25.0,91.0,"A focused line of lemon balm meets with gardenia, soft jasmine, light butterscotch and green tea on the nose of this county blend by Colombian-born, French-trained Winemaker Bibiana González Rave. Lemon, light vanilla and a touch of warm pastry show on the palate."
Syrah,US,California,Renwood,25.0,91.0,"This wine is drenched with dark fruit flavors, like blackberries and boysenberries, and fills the mouth with a velvety texture. It's just so expressive and generous, without much oak influence, that it comes off as simply delicious. Best after 2018."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Laurent Gauthier,25.0,91.0,"Volcanic ash over granite gives this vineyard its structured character, which carries over into this wine. Wood aged in large barrels, it has a rich firm character that will allow the wine to develop. Powered by acidity and tannins, the ripe black fruits are juicy and concentrated. Drink this wine from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Aconcagua Valley,Arboleda,25.0,91.0,"Briar spice, olive and asphalt aromas create a firm bouquet of black plum and blackberry at the core. This feels lively and serious, with black olive, herb, licorice, chocolate and dark-berry flavors. Herbal notes, blackened toast and mocha flavors on the finish are typical for Chile. Drink through 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Peyrefaure,25.0,91.0,"Black cherry aromas are followed by rich black fruit, plum and damson flavors in this wine. There is plenty of juicy acidity here as well, with tannins to support the richness. Drink from 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos,25.0,91.0,"Named in remembrance of the lost love of Portuguese king João V, this concentrated and rich wine is impressive. Its firm tannins are surrounded by the richest black fruits. They, in turn, are balanced with acidity and with a dry core that will allow the wine to age further. Drink from 2019."
Syrah,US,Washington,:Nota Bene,25.0,91.0,"Much more accessible than the winery's 2006 Syrah, this mixes muscle and meat, highlights from smaller component parts (Mourvèdre and Grenache) and overall clever blending. While bringing in the tart red fruit, the composted leaves, the moist loam and light funk of Washington Syrah, it also shows some pretty baking spices and a tight, precise finish."
Vermentino,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Vigne Surrau,25.0,91.0,"This impressive white from Sardinia opens with aromas of ripe orchard fruit, Mediterranean brush and a whiff of exotic fruit while the juicy palate doles out apricot, pineapple and candied citrus zest. An energizing mineral note brightens the creamy flavors."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Olivier Rivière,25.0,91.0,Spiced plum and cherry aromas get this live-wire Rioja going. A clawing palate with rubbery tannins needs time to settle. Toasty flavors of black fruits and oak finish with a rubbery texture due to drying tannins. Give this more time; drink from 2018–2028.
Picpoul,US,Washington,Syncline,25.0,91.0,"From an extremely rare grape variety for the state, this delivers citrus rind and flower blossom scents and sleek fruit flavors backed by mouth-puckering acidity. It screams for shellfish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Dirler-Cadé,25.0,91.0,"The wannabe Grand Cru of Belzbrunnen has produced this marvellously mature wine. It's fully ripe and shows its perfumed flavors strongly. The acidity is still very present, giving a tight presence to this impressive wine."
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Hans und Christine,25.0,91.0,"Warm, cinnamon-spiced blueberry and plum flood the palate, while approachable and supple tannins charm their way from start to long finish. This has wonderful balance of structure, fruit and medium-full body. This has huge charm right now and is very seductive, but it will also age well, if you can wait."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Gernot and Heike Heinrich,25.0,91.0,"This is a wood-aged wine that shows structure, dense tannins as well as juicy red fruits. The wood is finely integrated, lending a round texture to go with the dry character of the wine. For aging 4–6 years."
Merlot,US,Washington,Fidelitas,25.0,91.0,"Merlot is certainly one of the real strengths at Fidélitas, and two different versions are offered. This broad and flavorful effort has pretty cherry fruit backed with pleasing baking spices. The finish is focused and precise, adding streaks of cinnamon and chocolate."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Hiedler,25.0,91.0,"Gentle Mirabelle and lemon envelope nose and palate in a refreshing but soft embrace. This delicate wine combines lightness of touch with immense and sprightly citrus freshness. It works like a lemon sorbet: it cleanses, refreshes and tones. The lasting citrus flavors are a real bonus."
Rosé,US,California,Blackbird Vineyards,25.0,91.0,"Winemaker Aaron Pott saignées nearly equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon to craft this impressively complex, light-bodied and ethereal celebration of cranberry, strawberry and grapefruit. It shows more tartness on the finish as it pushes a final, refreshing suggestion of mandarin orange."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,25.0,91.0,"This is an excellent, dry, well-balanced and nicely tannic wine that would love to come to your next dinner featuring a roast bird or grilled chop. It's a bit reserved, not as showy as a lot of other wines, but has the gripping texture and firm acidity that is great at the table."
Riesling,Australia,Western Australia,Frankland Estate,25.0,91.0,"This vintage of Rocky Gully Riesling comes across as quite ripe and rich despite the modest alcohol content. Smoky hints of struck flint and heating oil spice up flavors of baked apple and vanilla, then linger on the finish."
Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Volker Eisele Family Estate,25.0,91.0,"A delightfully memorable blend of 76% Sémillon and 24% Sauvignon Blanc, this is a lithe, crisp and medium-bodied experience. The grapes were organically grown, whole-cluster pressed and fermented in stainless steel. It shines in Meyer lemon and wet stone, just a hint of creamy tropical fervor bubbling beneath the surface."
Rosé,US,California,Pennyroyal Farm,25.0,91.0,"Light and lively, this Pinot Noir-based wine has subtle but delicious, fresh and tangy cherry and raspberry flavors that unfold on the palate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Secret Squirrel,25.0,91.0,"The aromas bring notes of generous wood spices, high-toned herbs, black currant and black cherry, along with a vanilla top note. The black-fruit flavors show richness but also restraint, with dusty tannins giving support."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Tablas Creek,25.0,91.0,"This blend of 56% Grenache Blanc, 23% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 9% Marsanne from nine vineyards offers a pretty nose that mixes Key lime, honeydew, just-ripe nectarine and lily florality. It's bright and fresh on the tightly wound and texturally intriguing sip, with lime pith and lemongrass flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Agassac,25.0,91.0,"The second wine of Agassac is smooth, full of the fruit of this fresh year. With bright red-berry fruits and soft tannins it is a wine that is developing quickly. It will be delicious and ready to drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Hyot,25.0,91.0,"This is a ripe, fruity wine with its black-currant fruit and balanced sweet tannins. It has a fine elegant texture and juicy acidity.

Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Epiphany,25.0,91.0,"This year's blend of 53% Mourvèdre, 18% Counoise, 17% Grenache and 12% Cinsault shows squeezed elderberries, black raspberries, dried rose petals, potpourri, dried sagebrush and wet slate on the nose. The palate pops with more raspberries, pomegranate, dried fennel, white pepper and a touch of cooked lamb."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Castra Rubra,25.0,91.0,"The result of a joint project between Michel Rolland and Jair Agopian, this Bulgarian Bordeaux-style blend has primary aromas of ripe blackberry, dark cherry and black plum that give way to intriguing secondary notes of saddle leather, tobacco leaf and graphite. It exhibits nice weight on the midpalate with juicy flavors of cassis, black raspberry and cherry vanilla. The tannins are firm yet velvety and there is a surprising burst of bright fruit in the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Arndorfer,25.0,91.0,"Green pear, miso and soy sauce mingle spicily on the nose. The palate is a combination of rich, rounded yeastiness and fresh, zesty lemon. Sage and white pepper provide further layers. This is full of interest and freshness."
Syrah,US,California,Zaca Mesa,25.0,91.0,"The pioneering winery's basic Syrah, this is impressively complex and delicious, with aromas of coffee, blueberry, purple flowers, graphite and the slightest touch of beef jerky.

Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Inconceivable,25.0,91.0,"High toned aromas of spice, herbs and sweet plum are followed by black currant and blackberry flavors. It brings undeniable appeal."
Pinot Noir,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Franck Millet,25.0,91.0,"Partly barrel-fermented, this impressively ripe wine has structure and tannins, as well as attractive, perfumed fruits. The tannins add spice as well as a touch of pepper while integrating well with the lively, fresh fruits at the end. Drink from 2018."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Yangarra Estate Vineyard,25.0,91.0,"A unique blend of spice and blueberry sets this Shiraz apart from the pack, and it pulls away even further due to a lush, creamy texture and long, mouthcoating finish. There's great purity to the fruit, but enough peppery spice for complexity. Drink now–2016."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Lynmar,25.0,91.0,"Dark pink in color, this wine is marked by a nutty layering of light acidity and orange, Gravenstein apple and cherry flavors. It's delicate yet has enough stuffing and structure to pair with a wide array of dishes."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Alix,25.0,91.0,"This 40-acre estate in Pessac-Léognan has produced a spicy, wood-aged wine from 100% Sauvignon Blanc. The wine has a tang while also having concentration, a touch of toast and a floral aftertaste. It will age for a few years, and be ready from 2019."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Sparkman,25.0,91.0,"This wine is mostly Syrah (58%), Grenache (18%) and Petite Sirah, with small amounts of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cao and Tinta Madeira rounding it out. It brings aromas of dried herb, earth and blue and black fruit that are followed by palate-coating blue-fruit flavors, speckled with barrel spices, showing vibrant acidity."
Chardonnay,US,California,Moniker,25.0,91.0,"A beautiful and lightly spicy nutmeg character lights up this full-bodied wine from the first sniff to the lingering finish.

Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Clos de Tafall,25.0,91.0,"This is ripe and a bit raisiny with prune and fig notes to the bold bouquet. This feels chunky on the palate, but not fat or out of shape. Baked black fruit and raisin flavors finish solid and ready, with a note of licorice and an overriding sense of richness. Drink through 2020."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Lucien Lardy,25.0,91.0,"This offers plenty of tannins and a dry, firm structure along with the weight of ripe plums, blackberries and a rich character. The wine is certainly going to age, with its solid texture and bold fruit aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Perlage,25.0,91.0,"Made following the principles of biodynamic agriculture, this bright, savory sparkler offers aromas of white peach, green apple and chopped herbs.

This would be perfect for toasts or as an aperitivo."
Chardonnay,US,California,Cuvaison,25.0,91.0,"Crisp, yet fuller bodied, with a creamy voluptuousness to the mouthfeel, this wine offers a taste of lemon pith and peach, accented by a floral bouquet of orange blossom.

Pinot Noir,US,California,White Hart Wine,25.0,91.0,"From a vineyard that's 40 years old, this smartly priced bottling shows vanilla, clove, hickory smoke and black cherry on the hearty nose. The palate is soft upon entry, showing more of that clove against a baked black-plum background."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Lucas & Lewellen,25.0,91.0,"This distinctive bottling offers aromas of tobacco, wet coffee grounds, roasted pasilla chili, charcoal and charred beef that seem curious at first but quickly grow interesting. The palate shows much of the same, recalling a chile-flecked dark-chocolate brownie served atop a black cherry-blackberry reduction sauce."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois,25.0,91.0,"The small village of Saint-Andelain is at the heart of Sauvignon Blanc in Pouilly Fumé. This wine is ripe with melon and peach flavors cut with intense acidity. It is well textured, full bodied and should be held until well into 2017."

Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Pierre Gaillard,25.0,91.0,"Perhaps better known for his Côte-Rôties, Pierre Gaillard is obviously comfortable working with schist. Transhumance is an intense and complex wine, with assertive notes of kirsch, sweet smoke, wild game and garrigue accents of thyme, rosemary and violet. Rich and lush in the mouth, the texture is like crushed velvet and the finish evolves from a dark fruit blast to sweet vanilla bean and finally ending on a smoked cedar and spice note."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Hermann,25.0,91.0,"Layers of crisp nectarine, lime and tangerine burst from nose and palate of this vibrant Kabinett. While sweetly honeyed, it's a wine with precision, calibrated by zesty acidity and elegant crushed-mineral tones. Its lovely already but should maintain its intensity through 2021."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Clément Klur,25.0,91.0,"Pure notes of black cherry rise from the glass. The palate comes in with equal purity and quite some concentration.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Devise d'Ardilley,25.0,91.0,"From a small estate, this big, ripe and fruity wine has swathes of black fruits to go with the dark, brooding tannins. Very broad and fruity, the wine is always likely to be structured. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,25.0,91.0,"Ripe, juicy peaches and nectarines burst from the nose and palate of this semisweet Riesling. Sunny and pristine, with a soft, lacy sweetness, it's balanced by bristling acidity and a delicate minerality on the finish."

Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Fouassier,25.0,91.0,"Very pure—this has a straight line of acidity right to the wine's citrus- and pineapple-flavored heart. It is structured and taut, with its acidity dominant. It is concentrated and ready to age for 2–3 years."
Champagne Blend,US,New York,Dr. Konstantin Frank,25.0,91.0,"Saline and mineral tones accent fresh apple, pear and lemon in this zippy, invigorating sparkling wine. Made in a Chardonnay-based traditional-method style, its delicate pétillance and whiffs of caramelized sugar and brioche are enticing."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,T'Jara,25.0,91.0,"Sweet spice, sage and oregano accent this gorgeously complex, penetrating Cabernet Franc. It's satisfyingly plump with black fruit, but also brambly, herbaceous, and accented by deep, rich soil notes.

Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,25.0,91.0,"A ripe, creamy Chardonnay-like wine, the tropical orange and lychee fruits pointed up with new French wood. The fresh lime acidity cuts through the richness like a knife. This is a complex wine that would profit from a year's aging."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,25.0,91.0,"Very spicy, lychee-flavored wine, rich and concentrated. It is full of this perfumed character, with pepper, sweet spice and an edge of honey."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Castello di Spessa,25.0,91.0,"Alluring scents of white flower and beeswax fill the glass. Smooth and full bodied, the rich palate doles out ripe apple and pear set against a round polished texture."

Syrah,US,Washington,Tenet,25.0,91.0,"This is the inaugural release from this project that pairs Chateau Ste. Michelle with Rhône stars Michel Gassier and Philippe Cambie. Coming from a variety of vineyards across the Columbia Valley, it offers aromas of black cherry, smoke, incense and cocoa. The flavors are plush in feel with a finish that lingers—an impressive first offering."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,25.0,91.0,"This wine over-delivers a mouthful of juicy quality vis-a-vis price, combining Cab with smaller dabs of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Savory blackberry and cassis lift the fruitiness, seasoned in savory tones of black tea and cranberry that give it an edge. Fleshy and smooth, it's a good wine to stock up on."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Fiddlehead,25.0,91.0,"A slight hint of petrol on the nose of this wine by veteran Kathy Joseph then ventures into delicate and soft aromas of preserved lemons and scratched grapefruit skin. It's edgy in style, treading a pithy line of tangelo, pomelo and yellow grapefruit, with racy and lingering lemon-spritz acidity."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tiefenbrunner,25.0,91.0,"This opens with alluring aromas of Granny Smith apple, citrus zest and a hint of flint. On the creamy palate, notes of Alpine herb and mineral accent Abate Fetel pear and tangy nectarine. Lively acidity gives it a crisp finish. While enjoyable now, it will also drink well for several years. Enjoy through 2020."
Merlot,US,Washington,Kiona,25.0,91.0,"Despite the Columbia Valley label this is all Red Mountain, old-vine Merlot from the winery's estate vineyard.

Pinot Gris,Austria,Burgenland,Kracher,25.0,91.0,"Hints of ripe Mirabelle and yellow apple show on the rather restrained nose. The palate adds bright, lemony freshness and zesty, pleasantly bitter citrus pith to the fruit, creating a texture alive with juiciness and shot throught with freshness. It leaves a lasting, lemony aftertaste."
Merlot,US,Washington,Januik,25.0,91.0,"This wine's plum, vanilla, milk chocolate and blue fruit aromas are followed by a palate saturated with supersmooth fruit and barrel flavors. The variety isn't immediately apparent, but it's delicious all the same."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Ottella,25.0,91.0,"This elegant wine opens with enticing white spring flower, freshly picked orchard fruit and herb aromas.

Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Navarro Correas,25.0,91.0,"Smoky aromas of fresh-cut wood blend with berry and cassis form a welcoming, generous bouquet. This feels lively on the palate, albeit tartaric. Oaky plum, cassis and vanilla flavors finish full and agreeable. Drink through 2019."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Aigner,25.0,91.0,"Fleshy, ripe notes of yellow pear lead to a yeasty palate that fizzes with citric lift.

Chardonnay,France,France Other,Domaine Daniel Dugois,25.0,91.0,"This is a beautiful, ripe wine, flavored with quince, pear and apricots. It is above all the zesty texture that gives this wine its character and attraction. Fruity, structured and likely to age well, the wine should be drunk from 2015."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Hansen-Lauer,25.0,91.0,"Exuberantly floral, with notes of honeysuckle and orange blossom, yet not at all cloying or perfumy, this sparkler showcases all the delicacy and verve you expect from a Mosel Riesling. Softly effervescent, it's dry and spry on the palate, with an exceptionally long, peach-tinged finish."
White Blend,US,California,Kivelstadt Cellars,25.0,91.0,"Subtly delicious flavors merge with a creamy, luxurious texture in this deceptively light-bodied and graceful wine blended from Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier.

Rosato,Italy,Southern Italy,Pietraventosa,25.0,91.0,"Made with organically cultivated Primitivo grapes, this has enticing scents of red berry, wild flower, Mediterranean scrub and a whiff of pastry dough. The juicy delicious palate presents succulent morello cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and tangerine drop. It's a great example of why Puglia's rockin' the rosato scene in Italy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Viu Manent,25.0,91.0,"With integrated aromas of balsam wood, cassis, cherry and mixed spices, this smells elegant and inviting. A concentrated palate is slightly narrow in feel, while flavors of baked plum, cassis, black cherry and hard spices finish with toasty oak and chocolate notes. Drink through 2017."
Merlot,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,25.0,91.0,"High density planting of a vineyard on the slopes of the Azeitão mountains has produced a rich and seriously dense wine. It has enormous amounts of spice, oak-aged flavors and bitter tannins. The red fruits are lost at this stage in the welter of other flavors. but with time its true, impressive colors with shine. Drink after 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta de Lemos,25.0,91.0,"All four of Dâo's indigenous red grapes—Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Jaen and Alfrocheiro—are in this blend. It is rich and fruity wine, showing a lightly perfumed character against ripe black fruit tones. Drink now."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Schoffit,25.0,91.0,"An elegant, poised wine that's bone dry, nervy and lightly fruity. The wine is balanced between its fresh acidity and ripe fruitiness. With its bright texture, it's a wine that needs food. Drink from 2016."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière,25.0,91.0,"With its ripe red fruits and crisp acidity, this has a brightness that exudes charm and freshness. The aftertaste brings out a more textured character from a tangy orange zest flavor."
Riesling,US,California,V. Sattui,25.0,91.0,"This Riesling has just the right amount of minerality balanced against apple and peach flavors, and an underlying core of lime. Fermented in stainless steel, it is bright and joyful to drink, boasting a long finish. Pour alongside all the classic pairings from Asian takeout to a proper curry."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Lobo Hills,25.0,91.0,"Dried herb, plum, black licorice, woodspice and cherry aromas are followed by palate-coating black fruit flavors, showing depth and density. It's tightly wound at present, so give it a short decant."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Comartin,25.0,91.0,"Extremely tight and herbal aromas of cut grass, chives, scallions and oregano ride a fascinatingly rainy cement minerality on the nose of this fresh and vibrant bottling. The wet-cement flavors show powerfully on the sip, with lemongrass, wild lime leaves and more mowed-lawn touches."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Pewsey Vale,25.0,91.0,"The winery has kindly aged this bottling for you and is charging a relatively small premium for the service, so this is one to snap up if you can find it. Hints of grilled toast, marmalade and honey remain dry on the palate and extend through a long finish. Ready to drink."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Prats & Symington LDA,25.0,91.0,"This wine is stylish, with layers of wood, black currant notes and a structure that will allow the juicy fruitiness to develop relatively quickly. It's balanced, with fruit, texture and acidity all coming together. Drink from 2016."
Rosé,US,California,Sidebar,25.0,91.0,"Made from 100% Syrah, this dry, succulent wine is copper-colored and bursting in watermelon, cranberry and bristling acidity. Seamless, it's medium bodied and has plenty of texture to offer around a crisp, meaty finish. The label is a second offering from David Ramey, who makes this wine."
Red Blend,US,California,Volatus,25.0,91.0,"Lush aromas of black cherry pie, mint, graphite, fudge and vanilla bean show on the nose of this aged blend of Syrah and Malbec by former Navy pilot Hal “Bull” Schmitt. The palate is powered by garden herbs, from thyme to oregano and marjoram, as well as smoked meats and blackberry jam."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Villa Maria,25.0,91.0,"At first glance, this appears to be a well-made but fairly innocuous Marlborough Sauvignon. But give it a little more time in bottle, or air in the glass, and it fills out, gaining length and complexity. Pineapple and stone fruit aromas and flavors are appealing from the start, but the quality shines through on the long, vibrant finish that's filled with suggestions of nectarine and wet stone."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Larose Trintaudon,25.0,91.0,"This wine comes from a vast 460-acre vineyard on the plateau just west of Pauillac. The wood-aging just shows in what is otherwise a ripe and fruity wine. A firm tannic core indicates the youth of the wine rather than masking the fruit. Generous and fruity, this wine will develop well. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Studert-Prüm,25.0,91.0,"Fresh green plum, peach and honeydew flavors taste crisp and sweet in this refreshing semi-sweet spätlese. It's concentrated with fruit yet deft and dancing on the palate, accented by hints of dusty pollen and fennel. High-toned acidity leads a long, squeaky-clean finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Aubichon Cellars,25.0,91.0,"This is packaged in a hock bottle, as if to emphasize the bone dry minerality of this all-stainless cuvée. Aromatic and crisply dry, it was aged on the lees for five months, and deftly mixes nuanced flavors of citrus, wet stone, fresh herbs and light greens."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Guardian,25.0,91.0,"This wine is a blend of 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Merlot, and 29% Syrah from Ciel du Cheval, Obelisco, Quintessence and Conner Lee vineyards. Aromas of cigar box, herb, cranberry, smoke, sawdust and pencil lead are followed by rich, ripe red-fruit flavors. It has a lot of appeal."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Tablas Creek,25.0,91.0,"This 11-vineyard blend of 51% Syrah, 31% Grenache, 14% Mourvèdre and 4% Counoise represents an excellent value in the realm of expertly balanced but boisterously flavored wines. The fruity nose shows smashed raspberry, boysenberry, violet and potpourri, leading into a lively palate full of rose petals, exotic red cherries and turned earth. It's easy to drink yet intellectual as well."
Syrah,US,Washington,Tenet,25.0,91.0,"The aromas bring a sense purity, with notes of mountain blueberry, high-toned herb and whiffs of smoked meat. The flavors are fruit forward, showing a pleasing approachability and sense of freshness, with a finish that glides."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,25.0,91.0,"Perfumed, and still quite youthful, this is a wine with potential both from its texture and its acidity. There is a strongly chalky, mineral element that lends structure to the aromatic, crisp white fruits. On the finish, the wine has a cool, elegant character."
Viognier,US,Washington,K Vintners,25.0,91.0,"Now one of three Viogniers produced by Charles Smith, this is from Art den Hoed's Yakima Valley Vineyard, and was barrel fermented in neutral French oak. Clean and pure fruit aromas lead into fresh, natural, tree fruit flavors of peach and apricot. There's a nice kick of citrus in the vibrant acidity."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Bélingard,25.0,91.0,"From a selection of bunches that were left on the vines to gather noble rot, this wine is rich and wonderfully concentrated and with layers of botrytis and ripe fruits. Apricots and honey are balanced by the drier edge of the noble rot. It's a young wine still and will be even better from 2019."
Syrah,Spain,Catalonia,Alta Alella,25.0,91.0,"Ripe yet fresh aromas of black plum and cassis show notes of iodine and iron. This is exceedingly solid in feel, with a slight hint of bright acidity. Flavors of plum, blackberry and leather end in smooth fashion; drink through 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tour Bayard,25.0,91.0,"From a single parcel in this estate, this wine is a rich Merlot-dominated wine. It has dark tannins and plenty of juicy blackberry fruits that are deeply spiced by the wood aging. It is a full wine, ripe although with a fine streak of finishing acidity. Drink from 2019."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Dominio de Atauta,25.0,91.0,"Sophisticated aromas of blackberry, dried cherry, shoe polish and crushed leaves set up a grabby palate with ripe, bullish tannins. This wine offers black-fruit flavors along with spice, chocolate and herbal notes. On the finish, ripe berry and chocolaty oak flavors are generous. Drink through 2019."
Gewürztraminer,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Elena Walch,25.0,91.0,"Botrytised Gewürztraminer produces a rich, intense, luscious wine with layers of complex spice. A touch of Sauvignon Blanc introduces some clean, crisp freshness to give the wine a fine sense of balance."
Chardonnay,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Concha y Toro,25.0,91.0,"At first the nose is like caramelized popcorn, a forward combination of oak and toast. The flavors are of apple, pear and citrus, and that well-blended package is carried by excellent acidity, the type you could call “bracing.” The finish goes on for quite some time, proof that this is a ripe, healthy wine that's hitting its stride."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Black Stallion,25.0,91.0,"Earthy in black tea and leathery funk, the feral aspects of this wine are entirely compelling, giving a savory edge around grippy, full-bodied texture and weight. A Pinot for Cabernet fans, it'll stand up to steak and a whole lot more, delivering tremendous value for the quality."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,San Simeon,25.0,91.0,"Dried red cherries, woody elderberry, dried oregano and smoked brisket aromas show on the nose of this wine by the Riboli family. The palate offers lavender and other purple-flower extracts along with plums, black cherries and lots of tobacco and cigar box complexity."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaji,Dobogó,25.0,91.0,"Medium gold in the glass, this wine has a nose of Valencia orange, pear and kumquat. Flavors of lychee, kumquat and apricot mingle on the palate, remaining strong into the mineral-rich finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alma de los Andes,25.0,91.0,"This charred specimen smells resiny and of blackened oak, with grapy berry scents thrown in. In the mouth, this is rock solid and balanced. Heavily oaked resiny flavors rest on top of core blackberry fruit, while this shows woody dry tannins and salty baked berry flavors on the finish."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Montebaco,25.0,91.0,"Blackberry, dark plum, mineral, char and leather aromas are what you want from a quality wine from Ribera del Duero. A layered, fresh palate houses lightly brined plum, black cherry and leathery flavors. A toasty finish with licorice notes hums along in fine form. Drink through 2021."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de la Bonne Tonne,25.0,91.0,"This is a rich wine with the wood aging giving extra complexity and structure. It has cherry, plum and spice flavors, a dark sense that comes from the texture and the minerality. Drink this solid wine from 2014."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Gadais Père et Fils,25.0,91.0,"This is a ull, rich wood-aged Muscadet from old vines in a single vineyard. It is ripe, yellow fruit flavored and concentrated, the natural acidity of the Melon grape rounded and softened. It can be aged so drink now through 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Prim Family,25.0,91.0,"This very attractive, richly oaked wine melds all the wood smoke, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla of new barrels with delicious, ripe fruit flavors from the grapes. It has a suave, layered texture from the initial sip to the lingering finish, and is very hard to resist."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Pral,25.0,91.0,"This limited-production wine shows great structure appropriate for a wine that can age. It has a solid texture, full of rich cherry and black-plum fruits and a fresh line of acidity. The tannins give shape to the wine, which will certainly age. Drink from 2017."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Robert Perroud,25.0,91.0,"Made from selected parcels, this wine is structured and firm while not losing sight of rich red berry and cherry flavors. It's a dense wine, the tannins still developing and filling out to balance the fruits. Drink from 2017."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Stolo,25.0,91.0,"Almost as clear as water in the glass, this lively wine from an extreme coastal vineyard shows kiwi, crisp red apple and tons of limestone on the nose. There is lots of fresh energy once sipped, with yellow grapefruit, a touch of smoked Marcona almond and the warmth of sandstone. It continues growing more complex through the sip, leaving the mouth singing."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Foundry Vineyards,25.0,91.0,"Varietal bottlings of Sangiovese are an extreme rarity in this appellation, yet this wine makes its case for more. It shows aromas of herbs, cigar box, mocha, plum and raspberry jam. Flavors convey purity and concentration, with the tannins providing a lightly chalky feel."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Castello d'Albola,25.0,91.0,"An elegantly structured Sangiovese, this opens with aromas that recall fragrant blue flowers, underbrush, tilled soil, dark berry and a whiff of Mediterranean herb. The firm palate delivers black cherry, plum, vanilla, mocha and licorice alongside chewy but fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2019."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Le Bèrne,25.0,91.0,"This 100% Sangiovese opens with pretty aromas of iris, violet, dark berry and a blend of cooking spices. On the palate, ground black pepper, anise and espresso accent a core of dried black cherry while tightly knit, assertive tannins provide backup. Drink 2017–2022."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Nine Hats,25.0,91.0,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up the majority of this wine, which comes from The Benches and Weinbau vineyards. The dark brewed-coffee, herb, milk chocolate and cherry aromas, with rich, full-bodied flavors, provide plenty of allure and value."
Roussanne,US,California,Zaca Mesa,25.0,91.0,"Lemon-lime soda aromas meet with orange blossom, toast, lanolin and steel on the nose of this voluptuous yet well-defined bottling. It's tightly wound on the palate, with lemon, grapefruit rind and crushed limestone flavors, bound by a chalky texture, showing deft restraint for a Roussanne."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Penedo Borges,25.0,91.0,"This inky Malbec opens with an oaky blend of vanilla, blackberry, prune, cassis and tobacco aromas. A compact, firm palate is just lush enough, while oak-based flavors of cinnamon and baking spices rest on top of spiced plum and cassis. A peppery finish is intermixed with tobacco notes. Drink through 2021."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Chakana,25.0,91.0,"Compared to the regular 2006 Malbec from Chakana, this wine steps up in weight class and wins the crown. It's a serious but inviting red with spongey, ripe berry aromas topped by pure raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's both racy and composed, with a pile of bitter chocolate on the long finish. Good through 2009 at least."
Syrah,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Lapostolle,24.0,91.0,"Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry, coffee and spice flavors. On the finish, burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Los Vencejos,24.0,91.0,"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac,24.0,91.0,"A dark, brooding wine, packed with firm tannins and solid plum-skin and licorice flavors. The wine is dense and complex—a powerful evocation of Malbec—allowing the juicy fruits to merge with the young structure that needs agng for at least 4–5 years."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Rex Hill,24.0,91.0,"This sensational effort was fermented and briefly aged in neutral oak. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special. Red berries, blood orange, a touch of Grand Marnier, impressive body and spicy highlights all combine in a darn near irresistible rosé with the power to be a four season wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château de Crézancy,24.0,91.0,"With an average age of 45 years, the Chevreau family's vines bestow intensity and richness. This is a generous wine, the green fruits lifted by good acidity and a taut mineral texture that comes from the chalk in the soil. This wine is young but very ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,24.0,91.0,"Refined and complex, this limited-production, vineyard-designate wine starts with lemony acidity, but there's much more to discover as it bores down through the palate. Meyer lemons, grapefruit and nectarines are in the mix, with refreshing minerality."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Pali,24.0,91.0,"Another stunning deal on this annual bottling, this wine is jammy and fruity on the nose with buttered cherries and berry jam, yet layered with baking spice and wet clay minerality. Dried strawberries, black cherries and plums show on the palate, enhanced by a toasted clove, graphite, juniper and forest floor mintiness."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Stephen Ross,24.0,91.0,"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Azamor,24.0,91.0,"Still firm in tannins, this has developed into an austere and dark wine. It is serious and solid, with a firm, brooding character and layers of acidity as well as black currant fruits. It is probably ready to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut-Logat,24.0,91.0,"A wine that is rich in both tannins and ripe fruit. The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the concentration of the wine, with spice and black berry fruits that are given an extra richness by the intense dark plums. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2018."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Raventós I Blanc,24.0,91.0,"Smoky, oaky aromas of popcorn and buttered toast are louder than this bubbly's citrus and white-fruit scents. A bright, juicy, citrusy palate is full of pulse, while tangerine, orange and lemon flavors cut a direct path to a zesty finish showcasing white peach and nectarine flavors."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Montevannos,24.0,91.0,"For a crianza with eight years of age, this is still fresh and tight as a drum. The bouquet deals earthy, roasted berry aromas while the palate is earthy and toasty, with chocolate and loads of berry flavor. The finish is woody, smoky, firm and focused; drink now through 2016."
Red Blend,US,California,Toccata,24.0,91.0,"This blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Freisa is very approachable and food-friendly, showing baked black-cherry pie, star anise and pine resin on the nose. The palate dries up with red plum and flashes of strawberry set against shaved clove spices. It's layered in flavor but softly textured."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Ken Wright,24.0,91.0,"Pinot Blanc in a warm year such as 2012 veers closer to the fruitiness of Pinot Gris, as shown here. Barrel fermented in French oak, it remains sleek and crisply defined, with pure fruit flavors of golden apple and ripe pear."
Pinot Gris,New Zealand,Waipara,Mountford,24.0,91.0,"The only trouble with this bargain-priced version of a vendange tardive Pinot Gris will be finding some, as only 40 cases were imported. At only 11.6% alcohol, there's plenty of sugar left in the wine (67 g/l), concentrated and enriched by the inclusion of 50% botrytis-affected fruit. The impressions are of honeyed pineapple, ripe melon and peach preserves, finishing long and sweet. Delicious now, but should still be good 5–6 years down the road."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Dunham,24.0,91.0,"This is a juicy, buttery, nicely defined bottle with caramel and butterscotch flavors that run through its heart. Thoroughly delicious fruit notes of key lime and apple pie complete the picture."
Alsace white blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,24.0,91.0,"A pure rendition of honeysuckle blossom rises from this wine along with notes of ripe pear. The palate has something both crystalline and stony, pure and distinct. Beyond its central seam of freshness the wine shimmers with rich, earthy nuance of ripe pear on one side, of brisk zestiness on the other. Drink now and until 2020."
Red Blend,US,California,Naggiar,24.0,91.0,"A fabulous blend of Zinfandel, Sangiovese and Syrah, this wine has earthy, dried herb aromas, dense fruit and dark chocolate flavors and considerable soothing tannins. It is dry in style, not too full-bodied, and has a lingering finish. Needs time to mature, and will best after 2018."
Syrah,US,California,Lawer,24.0,91.0,"Perfumed and floral, crisp and modulated in acidity, this is an exuberant expression of the variety. Ample acidiy and cherry and orange flavors unfold on the palate, followed by a brisk finish that's laced in spicy nuance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Undurraga,24.0,91.0,"Herbal blackberry, raspberry and leather aromas are solid and inviting on the nose. The palate is juicy and lithe, with a springy, bouncy mouthfeel and lightly herbal, earthy flavors of cassis and raspberry. Drink through 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Vale Meão,24.0,91.0,"Meandro, named after the horseshoe bend on the Douro that surrounds the Vale Meão vineyard, is the second wine from this quinta. In its own right, it is a fine wine, solidly based around smooth, rich black berry fruits and spice. Age for 5–6 years at least."
Champagne Blend,France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre,24.0,91.0,"Named after the delicious perfume that wafts across the vineyards in the evening, Egarade is a fine example of how close in character Crémant de Bourgogne is to many Champagnes. It has just the right steely character, crisp and structured, a very mineral feel to the aftertaste."
Zinfandel,US,California,Oak Farm,24.0,91.0,"This big, ripe wine wraps intense and delicious fruit flavors in a plush but tannic texture, and does it so well that it's hard to put down the glass. The blackberry and cherry flavors taste pure and concentrated, seeming to gain intensity with each sip, and they linger through the finish with lip-smacking intensity."
Chardonnay,US,California,Riverbench,24.0,91.0,"A fresh, zesty bottling very much in the style of Chablis, this bottling by Clarissa Nagy shows steely minerality on the nose alongside sharp green apple, Anjour pear, scratched lime and white lily notes. The racy, apple-driven palate is bolstered by lemongrass and cut-lawn flavors, showing a shred of passion fruit as well."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Johannishof,24.0,91.0,"Pink grapefruit and peach nectar flood the palate of this intensely concentrated off-dry Riesling. It's buoyantly fruity and forward, but balanced squarely by a frame of lemon-lime acidity. The finish is pristine yet lingering."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château du Galoupet,24.0,91.0,"An eclectic range of grapes including Tibouren and Rolle go into this harmonious wine. The Provence cru classé estate has made a rich wine, full with red fruits as well as intense acidity and a tight structure. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2018."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Gassier,24.0,91.0,Organically grown grapes from one of the top Provence estates have produced this light grey-pink colored wine. It is a delicious fruity confection of bright red berries and tangy acidity. There is an attractive touch of minerality to give the wine structure. Drink now.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weszeli,24.0,91.0,"Despite the zesty lime notes which abound there is a hint of riper, more generous, almost tropical fruit: both mango and peach come to mind. The palate plays the same contrasting game and draws you in both with freshness and fruitfulness. A joy to drink."
Syrah,US,Washington,Watermill,24.0,91.0,"Smooth and chocolaty, this palate-coating Syrah brings ripe black-cherry flavors into a lush and compelling core. Just a hint of leather does not detract from the powerful fruit."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Trenel Fils,24.0,91.0,"The sense of structure that is so evident in 2010 wines is particularly apparent in this perfumed, rich and firmly tannic selection. It shows the hard edges of granite soil, plus juicy red fruit. Concentrated and complex, it needs several years to mature."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Duck Pond,24.0,91.0,"More orange or lightly blush than straw-hued, this is a fine single-vineyard wine. It's bone-dry, complex and sophisticated, with persistent pear and peach skin flavors, offering more detail and less obvious fruit than most Oregon Pinot Gris."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Guardian,24.0,91.0,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts out with aromas of dark coffee, toast, blackberry, fresh herbs and barrel spices (53% new French). It pulls no punches with rich blackberry and cherry flavors."
Aligoté,US,California,Calera,24.0,91.0,"Josh Jensen was the first to plant this alternative Burgundian white varietal in America, and this bottling offers notes of honeyed apricot juice, ripe nectarines and melons and toasted almonds. It's waxy and fleshy on the palate, with grilled lemon warmth, squeezed lime acidity and a nutty finish."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Derby,24.0,91.0,"Honey, crisp lemon and poached apple make for an excellent nose on this blend of 31% Marsanne, 26% Roussanne, 22% Grenache Blanc, 11% Viognier and 10% Picpoul. The flavors are equally impressive, with nectarine, white flowers and yellow pear making for an easy-to-quaff white wine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Symington Family Estates,24.0,91.0,"Still quite closed up, this is going to be a rich wine with great structure. For now, polished wood and stalky red fruits are filled out with fine tannins and a dry, tough core. It's a wine for aging, needing to soften. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Celler Piñol,24.0,91.0,"This five-grape, Garnacha-led blend captures the essence of Terra Alta with laser-focused aromas of blackberry, spice and stony minerality. A full, lively, acid-driven palate is balanced by creamy oak, while flavors of vanilla and coconut accent plum and berry fruit. Lasting acidity creates definition and length on the finish. Drink through 2020."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Franco-Españolas,24.0,91.0,"Ripe, easy aromas of dried cherry, raisin and cedary spice are not unfamiliar for aged, traditional Rioja like this. The palate is fresh in feel, with a touch of oak resin impacting the mouthfeel. Common flavors of cherry, plum and spice finish with cocoa, dill, vanilla and tomato notes. This is a classic Gran Reserva to drink through 2024."
White Blend,US,California,McCay Cellars,24.0,91.0,"Winemaker Michael McCay considers this white a field blend, listing Vermentino, Verdelho, Muscat and an improbable dollop of Pinot Noir as the varieties. Together they equate to deliciousness, a light, stainless-fermented statement of pineapple and guava, the Vermentino's salty head rearing just slightly."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Easton,24.0,91.0,"From a 2,500-foot elevation site, this Cab Franc is intriguingly peppery, light in oak and resplendent in raspberry liqueur aromas and a trace of pine forest. Moderate in tannins and silky in texture it's ready to be enjoyed now with cheese and charcuterie."
Syrah,US,Washington,Three Rivers,24.0,91.0,"This is pure Syrah from a winemaker who makes a number of single-vineyard and blended Syrahs. This dark, sappy, seductive wine has you from the first sniff. Though the fruit is big and briary, winemaker Holly Turner manages to capture the polish and elegance of Washington Syrah in the way the flavors are sculpted together. Veins of tar, chocolate, smoke, black licorice, pepper and tobacco accent the young, tight fruit flavors. This wine definitely needs breathing time to show its stuff."
Merlot,US,New York,McCall,24.0,91.0,"Wisps of cocoa powder and cinnamon lend a warm, spicy tone to this rich, berry-toned wine. Ripe black plum and blackberry flavors are lipsmackingly fruity but calibrated neatly by crisp acidity and fine, chalky tannins. The finish is long and lingering."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Trimbach,24.0,91.0,"Pear laced with subtle notes of smoke hints at a taut palate. The dryness and discipline of the poised flavors nonetheless allow the ripe, luscious pear fruit to glow and shine. Mouthfeel and texture are reminiscent of pear peel and bitter almond, and echo long after the last sip."
Syrah,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,Valle Secreto,24.0,91.0,"Cherry and plum aromas are pure and appealing as peppery accents pop up. This is flush and a bit lush, with spiced red plum and oaky chocolate flavors that end dry, elegant and focused. Valle Secreto makes consistently good Syrah; this is one of the winery's best to date. Drink through 2018."
Roter Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Leth,24.0,91.0,"A wonderfully subtle but aromatic nose combines appetizing notes of red apple, dried orange peel and a hint of yeast. These flavors combine into the most charming, easy-drinking but textured white wine. This strikes a wonderful balance between an aromatic, almost plump richness of aroma and a sprightly, fresh but concentrated palate. The edges show appetizing white pepper and orange zest. This is highly unusual (this grape represents just 0.4% of Austria's vineyards) but all the more joyous for it."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Shane Wines,24.0,91.0,"Melon, sea salt and white peach aromatics lean into a pomelo pith and wet concrete backbone on this crisp, nearly austere and completely impressive bottling. There is great lime peel and yellow grapefruit tension to the palate, which is linear and acid-driven, and possesses a chalky texture as well as warmer yellow pear flavors."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,a-non-ah-mus,24.0,91.0,"Apple strudel and lime sorbet met with crisp pear, tart lemon peels and a touch of quinine on the edges of this wine's nose. The palate is incredibly chalky and mineral-driven, with flavors of yellow apple peels and lime skins vying for attention amidst the grippy texture."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Prats & Symington LDA,24.0,91.0,"The second wine of the Prats and Symington partnership is rich and powerful in its own right. It is packed with blackberry, ripe tannins and a solid, dense structure. Acidity cuts through this dark wine that still needs to age. Drink from 2017."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Douro,Symington Family Estates,24.0,91.0,"A rich and luscious wine that has sweet tannins, blackberry fruits and ripe tannins. It's a complex wine, elegant with full fruits, juicy acidity and a strong, firm textured core. Big and full-bodied, this is a wine that can age. It is drinkable now and until 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Soudars,24.0,91.0,"A powerful, ripe wine with great sweet tannins, piled with black fruits, a dense texture and layers of wood. Despite all the richness, it still retains a sense of structured balance, finishing with good Bordeaux dryness and acidity."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,24.0,91.0,"Enticing scents of chamomile, white spring flower and white stone fruit mingle together in the glass. The creamy full-bodied palate doles out ripe honeydew melon, juicy yellow pear and nectarine zest while a ginger note adds depth. A far cry from the many bland Pinot Grigios that flood the market, this one is loaded with personality."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Refugio Ranch,24.0,91.0,"This delivers the best of both worlds for this aromatic grape. Crispy cut-grass notes blossom into tropical pineapple guava and green papaya. A laser focus of lime on the palate subsequently opens toward green pears, freshly cut oregano and dill, and an apple skin-driven bitterness."
Roussanne,US,California,Consilience,24.0,91.0,"This is a big wine on the nose, with lemon curd, vanilla cream, hot pie crust and white and yellow flowers mixing into a very lush invitation. The palate shows great restraint, though, with lemon peels and pudding balanced by a tight line of lime pith."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,24.0,91.0,"This is a well-made wine at a more-than-fair price. Labeled varietally, it also holds smaller additions of other Bordeaux red grapes, most notably 6% Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, leather and cassis surround smoky oak and firm, integrated tannin, making for a complex, full-bodied and balanced experience."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,24.0,91.0,Hints of earth and yeast deliciously suggest themselves onto the typical green pear notes. They also haunt the palate and give real resonance to the textured palate. This manages to be rounded yet svelte. The finish is lasting and combines pear and herbal notes of sage and savory yeast.
Riesling,US,Oregon,Penner-Ash,24.0,91.0,"Dry and sappy, this potent effort is heavily influenced by botanical flavors, to the point of being almost grassy. Dry extract and lemon/lime acidity keep the riper fruit flavors in check, but with ample breathing time the wine fills in with highlights of fresh peaches."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bench,24.0,91.0,"Sourced from two vineyards, including Sangiacomo Amaral Ranch, a cool site near the bay, this is a tremendous offering for the price. The wine is light, bright and brambly in raspberry and cherry kirsch, with a mischievous streak of cola. Pretty and fresh, it finishes in a tease of black tea."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Jean Reverdy et Fils,24.0,91.0,"This ripe, full wine has layers of green fruits over the acidity and mineral texture. It is structured and shows plenty of tight texture. But the fruitiness dominates, giving a refreshing edge and a crisp aftertaste."
Grenache,US,California,Clif Family,24.0,91.0,"This wine has just about the lightest pink color possible, very tempting floral and cherry aromas, and vibrant, mouthwatering cherry and grapefruit flavors. It's essentially light in body but so alive with fruit that it will drink well with almost any dish."
Fiano,US,California,La Folia Winery,24.0,91.0,"Aromatic in earthy green apple and mint, this is a bright, creamy California take on a white grape native to Campagna in southern Italy. Dry and moderate in body , it has a texture that's fresh and elegant, with a whispered suggestion of saltiness on the back-palate. Enjoy with spicy shellfish or a dish of briny olives."
Viognier,US,California,1850,24.0,91.0,"This wine pairs toasty, buttery, fresh bread aromas with ripe fig, cream and almond flavors. It's medium to full bodied, rich and viscous, keeping the luxurious flavors flowing over the palate and the toasted bread and almond notes echoing on the finish."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Maurodos,24.0,91.0,"While this is a bit scratchy and rugged up front, that's Toro in a nutshell. In the mouth, things are built like a brick house, while flavors of cassis and berry come with a medicinal note and chocolaty richness. Licorice, pepper and more chocolate flavor define the finish on this stout Tinta de Toro. Drink through 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Labat,24.0,91.0,"A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot has produced this fruity, juicy while also structured wine. It has concentration with layers of wood aging to support and fill out the fruit. It is still developing— still a young wine. Give it until 2018."
Petit Verdot,US,Washington,College Cellars,24.0,91.0,"It's rare to see a varietal bottle of Petit Verdot come out of this appellation, let alone a single vineyard offering but this one clearly deserves it. The aromas of flowers, soil, green herbs and purple fruit are light and brooding and lead to full but in balance black-fruit flavors. A lengthy finish caps it off."
Zinfandel,US,California,Pessagno Winery,24.0,91.0,"A lighter style Zinfandel, it's also lighter in color. Aromas align more with fresh minerality than deep fruit, though there is tobacco, plum jam and some pepper on the nose. Once sipped, cranberry and pomegranate compete for the fruit side, while cedar and pepper form the spice element. It's great for sipping on the porch and shows how Zinfandel can be impressively lean, even with 14.7% alcohol."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Sottano,24.0,91.0,"Chocolate and charcoal aromas form a dark and masculine greeting. There's also coffee and an herbal note to the nose. Lush but not heavy, tannic or plodding, with powerful black fruit and herbal flavors. Runs deep and long on the finish; impressive."
Chardonnay,US,California,Treana,24.0,91.0,"The Hope family dives into Chardonnay with this sleek bottling. The nose is tight with pink-grapefruit pith, unfurled white flowers and crushed seashells. Intriguing and elegant flavors of grapefruit blossom, guava shavings and sea salt buzz across the palate with humming electricity."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Martinborough,Stonecrop,24.0,91.0,"A terrific Pinot Noir value, Stonecrop's 2008 exhibits smoky, cedary aromas, but balances the oak with a solid foundation of cherry fruit and savory, mushroomy complexity. It's full bodied yet elegant, with a meaty finish. Drink now–2013."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Sainte Marguerite,24.0,91.0,"Red fruits dominate this rich wine. It has great balance and a smooth texture, with red plum, loganberry and caramel flavors. With its structure, it could even age a year."
St. Laurent,Austria,Burgenland,Pittnauer,24.0,91.0,"Subtle but very pure notes of morello cherry rise aromatically. The morello expression becomes even stronger on the toned, elegant and ever-so-slender palate with just the right amount of tender, tannic structure. This is effortlessly stylish and at the same time very honest and fresh-faced."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,24.0,91.0,The bracing freshness of green pear peel mixed with lemon freshness soon yields to a softer fruit note on the nose. Some creamy midpalate texture lends extra weight to this slender wine that charms effortlessly with lemony verve.
Spätburgunder,Germany,Baden,Franz Keller,24.0,91.0,"Tart Morello cherries and black plums are accented with spice, cocoa and balsamic notes throughout this earthy, nuanced Pinot Noir. It's already showing signs of maturity, but elegantly so. Enjoy now through 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Fields Family,24.0,91.0,"This is a complex Lodi old-vine Zinfandel with boysenberry and blackberry notes poking through layers of complexity and a touch of dusty plum. It has a strata of black licorice throughout the midpalate, with a peppery, wild herb flavor keeping it interesting. Notes of espresso and leather mark the finish, and a controlled amount of acidity keeps in balance."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Ventisquero,24.0,91.0,"Spicy, dry plum and berry aromas are lightly floral and complex on the nose. This Cab is elegant and sturdy on the palate, with plum, raspberry and chocolate flavors that finish with grip, length, complexity and a welcome freshness. Drink through 2021."
Sangiovese,US,California,Naggiar,24.0,91.0,"Richness makes this wine exceptional, while it still keeps its varietal personality. Aromas are grapy, almost jammy, then the flavors are quite fruity and berrylike, accented by mineral and chocolate notes. A finely tannic texture braces everything for an appetizing mouthfeel."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,24.0,91.0,"The Pfeiffer Vineyard also contributes fruit for the winery's excellent Unity bottling. Here, its grapes are the whole show, and the wine is focused and substantial. It drills down with precise flavors of peach and pear with a touch of citrus, all showing excellent length and depth."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Winzer Krems,24.0,91.0,"The richest of the Grüner Veltliners from the Krems cooperative, this has power as well as the ripest fruit. The flavors are of pear, melon and freshly ground spice, edged with a green apple skin texture. There is depth of flavor, the fruits going right into the core of the wine."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,24.0,91.0,"Lavishly oaked, but richly fruited as well, with layers of ripe peaches and grilled nuts leaving a creamy impression of luxury on the palate. The finish is long and vanilla-tinged yet features mouthwatering citrus. Drink now–2012."
Petite Sirah,US,Washington,Angel Vine,24.0,91.0,"Aromas of tar, flowers, barrel spice and dark fruit lead to palate-staining purple-fruit flavors backed by firm but quite well integrated tannins. It shows a compelling sense of purity."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Pittacum,24.0,91.0,"A bit rubbery and earthy at first but with time it develops, yielding syrupy berry aromas, woodsy oak notes and dried cheese. The palate feel is deep, lush and silky smooth, while it tastes of ripe berry, coconut and vanilla. Softer than some, with a lush texture that will allow for near-term drinking."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Setriolo,24.0,91.0,"This lovely wine has hallmark aromas of violet, wild cherry and berry, with whiffs of pressed powder. The palate is bright and delicious, with marasca cherry, raspberry and licorice flavors."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,24.0,91.0,"A wine made from dried Moscatel with Sherry characteristics? This is that and more. Aromas of raisin, cinnamon, flowers and caramel are particular for dessert wines. In the mouth, this is fresh and juicy but substantive, with caramel, toffee, coffee and spice flavors running onto a long finish with toffee and chocolate notes. This is ripe and sweet but balanced and delicious."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Ken Wright,24.0,91.0,"Barrel fermented in neutral French oak, this mouth-watering Pinot Blanc uses fruit from the Meredith Mitchell and Freedom Hill vineyards. It rested on the lees until bottling, yielding a rich, even creamy wine, with a gentle spiciness and plenty of acidity. A hint of beeswax and the lightest suggestion of toast bring more interest to the finish."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,24.0,91.0,"A wine that shows its wood aging from the mint aromas and dark, dry texture. At this young stage, the 18-month barrel aging weighs heavily on the fruit, but this should certainly soften after 3–4 years. An impressive wine showing the richness of 2009."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Coto de Imaz,24.0,91.0,"Classic Rioja aromas of earthy berry, cassis and raisin along with cocoa and dry spice notes announce a ripe wine with complexity. A dense palate with good acidity sets the stage for baked berry, cassis and raisin flavors. This Tempranillo is earthy and smooth on the finish. Drink through 2020."
Syrah,US,California,Scott Harvey,24.0,91.0,"Blackberry, boysenberry, smoke and grilled meat flavors fill this rich, well-balanced and medium to full-bodied wine. The aromas are charming and appetizing, making it seem ready to drink now. However, the mouthfeel is very firm with tannins and acidity, signaling that the wine should age well through at least 2020."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Ca' Viola,24.0,91.0,"Fragrant and fresh, this offers scents of blue flowers, wild berry, moist earth, chopped herbs and a hint of baking spice. The vibrant, supple palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside fresh acidity. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink through 2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Héroe,24.0,91.0,"This ode-to-the laborers twist-top bottling is a solid sipper, with aromas of turned earth and black slate giving depth to black cherry and blueberry fruits that sit atop a mole sauce made from chocolate and dried bell peppers. The palate offers more dark fruit, chocolate and lava rocks, set amidst fine-grained tannins."
Primitivo,US,California,Macchia,24.0,91.0,"Intensely aromatic in spicy black cherry and earthy leather, the Devious Primitivo is more structured than some of Macchia's Zinfandels, more savory than sweet, with tannic grip. Smooth and velvety, it'll impress alongside salumi and other charcuterie."
Merlot,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Lapostolle,24.0,91.0,"Fully oaked plum and berry aromas are dense and inviting. This feels flush and full, with scratchy tannins. The flavor profile offers plenty of oak and related chocolate to go with blackberry and plum notes. Oak remains in the lead on the finish, which is stacked with blackberry, dark plum and wild-berry flavors. Drink through 2025."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Robertson,De Wetshof,24.0,91.0,"This is a young, fresh and very attractive Chardonnay, brimming with aromas and flavors of wood-grilled apple, honeydew, Honeycomb cereal, buttered popcorn and toasted oak. The palate is round and full, yet with ample acidity, citrus flavor and a mineral streak that all provides lift and character to the close. Drink 2016–2020."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,24.0,91.0,"Ripe yellow pear and red-cheeked apples combine into a fresh and lively fruitiness. The edges are just seamed by a little peppery herbal spice while fresh citrus delivers refreshment. This delivers squeaky-clean lightness, fruit with a little peppery twist."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Fouassier,24.0,91.0,Tropical fruits dominate this rich wine. Mango and pineapple flavors are freshened with a twist of lemon. There are only hints of a more steely character in this full and round wine that's ready to drink now.
Barbera,US,California,Rosa d'Oro,24.0,91.0,"This has a vivid, ripe, black cherry flavor, with fresh sweetness and bursting acidity. It makes for a gorgeous, generous character buoyed up by firm tannins, a lively texture and finish, and no noticeable oak. A great find from a small, ambitious Lake County winery that loves Italian varietals."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Lapostolle,24.0,91.0,"Dark in appearance, with reduced, grapy, inky aromas, this compact Carmenère nearly collapses under its own weight. Heavily toasted blackberry flavors finish stout, with blackened spice notes. If there's a knock on this blockbuster, it's that it lacks layering and elegance."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Grand Boise,24.0,91.0,"Made from organic grapes, this estate wine from the high-altitude property is crisp and tightly fruity. It boasts great acidity and refreshingly bright red-currant fruitiness. This is ready now."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Clos Gautier,24.0,91.0,"Produced from vineyards around the chateau Gilles Pedini took over in 2011, this is warm and ripe wine. It balances rich red-berry fruits with acidity to give a crisp edge to a smooth wine. With intense fruitiness and a delicious aftertaste, this is a great food wine, ready to drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Longplay,24.0,91.0,"This is a delight—a supple, polished, ripe and full-throttle Pinot Noir offered at a mid-1990s price. Winemaker Aron Hess keeps the alcohol at 13.5%, the oak a moderate 20% new, and the earthy underpinnings gracefully in check. Lush purple and blue fruits are lightly licked with chocolate; the result is a very satisfying mouthful of wine."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Johann Heinrich,24.0,91.0,"Vanilla and notes of mocha pervade nose and palate: this peppery, ripe and cherry-laden Blaufränkisch has a good dollop of fine oak spice. The generous body counters dill fruit and mellow spice with ample freshness and ripe, pliable tannins. Lovely now but a year or two of bottle age will reveal more of the rich fruit."
Pinot Grigio,US,New York,Channing Daughters,24.0,91.0,"Like rose gold in a glass, this skin-fermented Pinot Gris glimmers with complexity. Aged in a combination of French and Slovenian oak, it's lavishly aromatic, penetrating the palate with tones of potpourri and spice, citrus rind and smoked tea leaves. Tart tangerine acidity lends vibe and refreshment through a long, long finish."
Petite Sirah,US,Oregon,J. Scott Cellars,24.0,91.0,"Capturing the dense essence of Petite Sirah, this marries deep berry flavor to a highlight of Bourbon-soaked chocolate. It's not overly sweet, but it's definitely a dessert wine."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Zull,24.0,91.0,"Planted with cuttings from many Austrian wine regions, the Aussere Bergen vineyard produces a ripe, full wine, packed with yellow fruits, spice and a feeling of opulence, while always balanced."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Baker & Brain,24.0,91.0,"There is an exuberance to the nose of this bottling, with peach and apple blossoms, honeysuckle, cherimoya and nearly a tropical, banana-like scent. Yet it tightens up nicely on the sip, where pithy apple flesh, Meyer lemon tang and Asian pear flesh combine for a zesty palate."
Gelber Muskateller,Austria,Niederösterreich,Nigl,24.0,91.0,"Evoking green grape, peach, honeysuckle and ripe melon, this Muscat's aromatic profile is as enticing as ever, all wrapped in a slender, absolutely dry and light-footed package. Full of rich flavor without the attendant weight, it embodies the scent and joy of summer and finishes on a refreshing note of zesty lemon."
Chardonnay,US,California,Center of Effort,24.0,91.0,"A solid, compelling bottling for an entry-level wine, this was aged in a combination of French oak, acacia wood and concrete, and shows clean Gala apple and brioche aromas. Grippy tension and sizzling acidity fire up the palate, bringing the wine's apple and peach flavors to the fore, sprinkled with savory sea salt and spice."
Grenache-Syrah,Spain,Central Spain,Tres Patas,24.0,91.0,"Méntrida is an island wine region in the middle of central Spain, and this blend of Garnacha and Syrah is lively, juicy and delicious. The nose is deep and luscious, with mounds of cassis and blackberry. The spunky palate shows big tannins but plenty of offsetting fruit and pulp. Finishing notes of chocolate and pepper leave a positive lasting impression. Should age for several more years; 400 cases produced."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Peñagudo,24.0,91.0,"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking. A really nice crianza that will settle and only grow more complex over the next few years."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Torres,24.0,91.0,"Since Torres launched Celeste a few years ago, the wine has gotten better and better with each passing vintage. The 2006 is friendly and complete, with no outlying or iffy aromas or flavors. This is textbook Ribera; it has smoothness and size along with intriguing black cherry, plum, herbs, tea and tobacco. A bottling for pretty much any wine lover."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,24.0,91.0,"A terrific example of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Swamp Block features ripe melon and nectarine fruit, balanced by hints of garden greens, such as tomato leaf and bell pepper. It's plump and succulent on the palate, with a long, slightly honeyed finish."
Grenache-Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de la Mordorée,24.0,91.0,"Located in Tavel, Domaine de la Mordorée has been one of the quality leaders in neighboring Lirac. This wine is dark and earthy at first, but opens with airing to reveal bold notes of blueberry, mocha and peppery spice. This 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah is full bodied, richly textured and finishes long."
Red Blend,US,California,M2,24.0,91.0,"Turbo-charged fruit flavors, full body and an almost thick texture make this wine opulent and compelling. While technically dry, it has such ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors that it tastes like a syrup, coating the sides of the mouth with fruit flavor and powering to a lingering finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Bernard Magrez,24.0,91.0,"This is a rich wine still dominated by solid, firm and dry tannins. Its black and red fruits are ripe and juicy, and its freshness comes from acidity that appears on the finish. Age this balanced effort for 4–5 years, at least."
Rosé,US,California,Kokomo,24.0,91.0,"The vineyard-designated Grenache grapes are given a whole-berry press before fermenting in stainless steel, encouraging the lithe strawberry and watermelon essence of this wine to sing unabashedly, adorned by supporting minerality and an overall lightness of being. This is a lovely sipper for all manner of moments."
Viognier,US,California,Claudia Springs,24.0,91.0,"From a cool, inland section of Mendocino County, this Viognier opens with gorgeous aromatics—heavenly honeysuckle and grapefruit—and offers up crisp, dry, borderline bracing acidity that pulls back just at the right moment. Nicely textured, the finish lingers."
Chardonnay,Canada,British Columbia,Quails' Gate,24.0,91.0,Full barrel fermentation in French oak yields a delicious Chardonnay with fruit tasting of grapefruit and peaches. The buttery mouthfeel and streak of vanilla cookie match up well with the expected acidity from Okanagan grapes.
Albariño,US,California,Cambiata,24.0,91.0,"The potential for this grape grown in cool California climates remains very high, as evidenced in this crisp and bracing bottling. Cut limes, chalk and wet slate are leveled by richer nectarine and lime blossom notes on the nose, while the sizzlingly acidic palate combines fresh citrus with green pear, green apple and lemon balm flavors."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,24.0,91.0,"This deep and rich wine is as much about tense structure as about fruit. It's a full-blown, very ripe wine that hasn't lost one iota of elegance. From selected fruit, this is a serious wine for aging. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,La Honda Winery,24.0,91.0,"Almost crystal-clear in the glass, this bottling shows broad aromas of red apple and peach before the grass, wet hay, squeezed lime and rainy sidewalk aromas stand up. There is a sharp texture and tension to the sip, where the warmth of poached pear is cut by mowed lawn and wet river stones."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Mumm Napa,24.0,91.0,"A hearty 80% Pinot Noir dominates in this sparkler, rounded out with 20% Chardonnay. With a pink-salmon hue, it offers peach and wild strawberry aromas followed by similar, medium-bodied flavors, with the addition of succulent plum."
Riesling,US,California,Standing Sun,24.0,91.0,"This wine shows a very intriguing nose of iodine, preserved lemons, orange marmalade and dried daffodils. The palate is quite distinctive with dried jasmine flowers, dried lemon peels and a sour-orange element shining throughout."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Storm,24.0,91.0,"A slight skunky, entirely pleasant aroma of damp herbs hits the nose first on this bottling by South African vintner Ernst Storm, then a slick rush of lemon-lime peels, ripe kiwi and green apple blossoms washes in. Flavors are driven by grapefruit and pomelo, with a wet-cement minerality."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,24.0,91.0,"From volcanic soil, this ripe, but tight style of Muscadet is one that needs aging. Even after two years, the acidity has not completely molded round the fresh grapefruit flavors. It's lively, very crisp, demanding food."
Colombard,US,California,Y Rousseau,24.0,91.0,"From decades-old, dry-farmed vines, the wine then 100% barrel fermented, this vintage the grapes were picked particularly early and were still quite rich and full, prompting this experimentation. Lemony bright, floral aromas and flavors meet a lean, refreshing body of apricot and green apple, a pleasant experience from start to finish."
St. Laurent,Austria,Burgenland,Gerhard Pittnauer,24.0,91.0,"Aromatic ripe, red cherries reveal a tart touch of redcurrant on the nose. The palate has that same appetizing, red-fruited allure: refreshing and juicy, but never heavy. A fresh-faced and authentic red, it has been captured at the perfect intersection of ripeness and crunch. It can even be served a little chilled."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Catena Zapata,24.0,91.0,"This is quintessential Argentine Malbec. Aromas of roasted black fruits and smoke transition to a toasty, oaky palate with a spectrum of flavors ranging from herbal to jammy berry. In between are notes of tobacco, spice and molasses. Drink now through 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Left Coast Cellars,24.0,91.0,"A splendid example of affordable Oregon Pinot, this benefits from a great vintage for forward, fruit-driven wines. It has additional assets: balance, texture and length, all compact in a young wine still in its infancy. The sappy raspberry fruit and overall polish suggest giving it another couple of years of bottle age before opening."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Leasingham,24.0,91.0,"This mouthfilling red features lashings of oak, but the bountiful blackberry and blueberry fruit still shines, framed by notes of maple syrup and vanilla. The finish delivers a powerful finale of tannin, but the bold fruit powers through. Drink now–2015."
Grüner Veltliner,US,Oregon,Chehalem,24.0,91.0,"This is a delicious, tongue-tickling wine, crisp and solidly built with fresh fruit flavors of apple, lime and tangerine in abundance. Beyond that there is body and depth, with the fresh acidity that supports a great variety of lighter seafood, shellfish and poultry."
Riesling,France,Alsace,René Muré,24.0,91.0,"Jasmine and summer blossom hover over ripe, aromatic aspects suggesting melon or quince that shine with power on the dry, streamlined and taut palate. The freshness is immense in this precise, bracing and charming wine."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Lamadrid,24.0,91.0,"Earthy aromas of Boston baked beans and stewed berry fruits set up a stout, dense, ripe palate. This wine tastes of baked berries and cassis. A finish with spice-cake flavors feels dense and meaty, with a savory aftertaste."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Messias,24.0,91.0,"This Messias family vineyard is close to their main winery in Bairrada. The wine, with its proportion of Baga, is full of acidity as well as tannins and black-currant fruit. It offers a touch of saltiness as well as spice. The wine is just approaching maturity so drink from 2018."
Roussanne,Australia,South Australia,Yangarra Estate Vineyard,24.0,91.0,"Made in a rich, opulent style for near-term consumption, Yangarra's Roussanne features exotic notes of toasted hazelnuts, bananas Foster and ripe pineapple. It's full-bodied without being overly heavy, with a long finish redolent of tropical fruit and citrus."
Zinfandel,US,California,Quivira,24.0,91.0,"Earthy dried herb and truffle provide a rough-and-tumble point of view in this wine, a mix of complexity and contoured acidity. The shy, juicy red fruit is cradled in integrated oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Judean Hills,Jerusalem Wineries,24.0,91.0,"Deep red-violet in the glass, this wine has a nose of black cherry, smoked meat and a hint of green pepper. It is a well-balanced wine with sturdy tannins and flavors of black cherry, blackberry, anisette, violet and ground black pepper. The finish is characterized by a touch of orange peel and a sense of salinity."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Stéphane Aviron,24.0,91.0,"This wine is packed with cheerful red fruits that are given a more serious edge by the tannic structure and acidity,. With its touch of pepper and minerality, it will age well over the next two years. The cru wine comes from a family-owned property on steep slopes."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Terras Gauda,24.0,91.0,"Peachy, floral aromas are friendly and clean. This blend of mostly Albariño and some Caiño Blanco and Loureira is round on the palate, with ample volume. Appealing flavors of melon, peach and apple finish dry and with a hint of white pepper. Wines like this are why almost everyone loves Albariño from Rías Baixas."
White Blend,US,California,Derby,24.0,91.0,"This blend of 83% Albariño and 17% Grenache Blanc is slightly incongruous from the juicy nose to the tight sip, but it works. Sunny aromas of honey, peach and white flowers hint at a sweeter wine, but the palate is tight, bright and bone dry, showing orange mousse, Key lime and grassy flavors."
Syrah,US,California,La Clarine Farm,24.0,91.0,"The Suma Kaw Syrah from Hank Beckmeyer is an intriguing combination of great site and experimental winemaker. It's woody and herbal with a menthol sheen and an unexpectedly bright crispness contrasted by dark, savory meat and smoke. A wine that'll start conversations, enjoy it with roasted, herb-encrusted meats—the culinary equivalent of the wine."
Monastrell,US,California,Los Portales,24.0,91.0,"This is a generous, mouth-filling and deftly complex wine that's also deep and concentrated. It seems to blend the meaty character of Mourvèdre, also known as Monastrell, with more fruity and spicy nuances."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Hall,24.0,91.0,"A woody, toasted note speaks to well-integrated yet present oak in this white that maintains medium-bodied texture on the palate. Bright, lemony acidity complements the creaminess, dashing in wet stone and undeniable floral notes of apple and orange blossom."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Carol Shelton,24.0,91.0,"A zesty blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this shows melon, tuberose, white lily and sharp lemon zest on the nose. The palate treads between energy and warmth, offering citrusy acidity against buttered, toasted nuts, all framed by a pithy grip that keeps the texture center stage."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Greece,Atalanti Valley,Hatzimichalis,24.0,91.0,"Aromas of red fruit, vanilla and cigarbox start this Cabernet Sauvignon from Greece. Its flavors are rich but balanced—cinnamon, cedar, cherry and savory spice—and the wine finishes clean and dry. Elegant with ageable potential."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine Fond Croze,24.0,91.0,"If you haven't puzzled it out from the name, this is a Syrah-based cuvée. Aged 14 months in second-use oak, it features dark, smoky notes on the nose to balance the bright raspberry aromas, then turns darker and meatier on the palate, ending with a hint of coffee. The tannins are supple and impart a rich texture. Drink now–2017."
Barbera,US,California,Fiddletown Cellars,24.0,91.0,"This wine is concentrated, richly textured and full of great dark fruit character. It smells like plump blackberries and raspberries, tastes ripe, lush in the mouth, and lingering on the finish. What's more, it has very good balance, full body and well-integrated tannins."
Zinfandel,US,California,Uvaggio,24.0,91.0,"Concentrated fruit flavors, full body and a smooth, broad mouthfeel make this wine soothing and satisfying to drink. Made from vines growing on their own roots, the wine delivers a ripe berry and cherry character that floods the palate and lingers nicely on the finish."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Brooks,24.0,91.0,"The vines date back to 1974, and there are suggestions of old-vine complexity throughout. The nuanced flavors mix Meyer lemon, apricot, peach and papaya, with defining acidity that is almost sweet rather than tart. A streak of minerality zips through the finish."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Angel Vine,24.0,91.0,"Coming from the Horse Heaven Hills region, this wine offers appealing aromas of cranberry, raspberry fruit leather, red currant and spice—all displaying a fine sense of purity. The tart fruit flavors are broad and generous but stay in balance."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,The Four Graces,24.0,91.0,"Refined flavors of lime, grapefruit, pineapple, citrus skin and stone combine in a clean crisp delightful wine. The naturally bright and refreshing acidity puts a pleasant pucker into the finish, and will have you reaching quickly for that next glass."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bouchaine,24.0,91.0,"This blends 70% whole cluster-pressed juice with 30% saignée, vinified entirely in stainless steel. Fresh flower, cherry, strawberry and tangerine flavors wash brilliantly over the palate, lifted by acidity and just enough weight to feel lush."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Sottano,24.0,91.0,"Opens with lovely blackberry and herb aromas that suggest richness and ripeness but not overt weight. It feels lush and deep, and tastes totally pleasant and easy, with black fruit, toast and pepper flavors. A thorough and balanced blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Syrah."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Paul Blanck,24.0,91.0,"Developed, creamy notes of pear have an aromatic edge of banana bread. The palate is equally creamy and rich with notions of vanilla, baked frangipani pear and vanilla spice, but lemony freshness at the core provides balance, direction and freshness. Flavors linger long."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Gadais Père et Fils,24.0,91.0,"Wood-fermented Muscadet is rare and this limited edition from 40-year-old vines is certainly unusual. The toast and spice have taken away the natural fruitiness of the Melon grape while adding a richer texture and a ripe, full-bodied ageworthy feel. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,Chile,Curicó Valley,Aresti,24.0,91.0,"This wine has traveled miles in the right direction compared to its early incarnations. It's piercing and potent up front, with cigar box, mocha, toast and coffee aromas in addition to fine flavors of tobacco, cassis, vanilla and lightly baked berry and cassis. Finishes wavy and long; 50% Syrah along with Merlot, Cab and Carmenère."
Muscat,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,24.0,91.0,"A totally luscious notion of tropical fruit on the nose is surprising: both pineapple and passion fruit appear. The palate is light and slender, fresh and precise, but the tropical richness persists. This is intriguing, delicious, dry and fun. The finish is whistle-clean."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Hansen-Lauer,24.0,91.0,"Opulent tropical fruit and florals perfume this decadently ripe yet bracing wine. It's intensely fruity and juicy yet spine tingling with acidity. Blossom and honey notes leave a lingering, pleasantly viscous trail of sweetness on the palate. Delightful now but likely to hold through 2022."
White Blend,US,California,Steven Kent,24.0,91.0,"Vivid flavors and zippy fruit acidity give this medium-bodied blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon a big but refreshing personality. It has vibrant citrus and fresh herb aromas, crisp grapefruit and lemon flavors, and a sense of depth on the palate without being heavy. There are so many ways this would start a meal off right."
White Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Seilly,24.0,91.0,"This full-bodied wine with its spice and creamed pear fruit flavors, feels rich and smooth. Structured and textured, the balanced acidity shows through well, giving a warm, off-dry aftertaste."
Syrah,Australia,South Australia,Sidewood,24.0,91.0,"Interestingly, Sidewood's 2008 Reserve Shiraz comes in considerably lower in alcohol than the regular bottling. It features a complex interplay of herb, spice and olive that gives it a stylistic resemblance resemblance to northern Rhône Syrahs. The tannins are silky, the finish long and balanced. Drink now–2018."
White Blend,US,California,Markus Wine Co,24.0,91.0,"This dry, fruity wine made from Germanic grape varieties gains extra richness in mouthfeel and body due to being fermented in 60% new barrels. It has ripe apple and peach notes and buttery, toasty accents that add interest and complexity."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Terlan,24.0,91.0,"Here's a savory Pinot Grigio that's loaded with character, offering inviting aromas of white spring flower and ripe orchard fruit. The round, medium-bodied palate has just enough weight, doling out ripe Bartlett pear, creamy yellow apple and a hint of juicy tangerine while an energizing mineral note closes the finish."
Rosé,Germany,Rheinhessen,Wittmann,24.0,91.0,"Intensely concentrated sour cherry and raspberry flavors ripple throughout this lusciously textured Pinot Noir rosé. It's intensely forward and fruity yet nuanced with hints of nut, spice and toast. Supple and slightly clinging on the palate yet briskly structured, it can stand up to a wide variety of cuisine and far beyond those fleeting summer months."
Albariño,US,California,Mattina Fiore,24.0,91.0,"There's an almost green tint to this wine and the nose shows honeyed peach, Key-lime pie, kiwi fruit and a touch of white pepper. The palate is tightly focused yet brings ample structure, with lime rinds, green-apple skin and red-apple flesh combining for a strongly complex sipper."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,24.0,91.0,"The beautiful perfume that unites tangerine peel and apple, lemon and blossom makes for an inviting nose. The palate brims with the same generous and utterly fruit-driven flavors. This is Riesling at its most charming. The finish is off dry, but all the more fruit driven for that."
Merlot,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Lapostolle,24.0,91.0,"Black in color, with sweet, full-force aromas of cola and black fruits. There's staunch acidity on the palate, something that will barely be noticed if drunk with food. Meanwhile, the flavors are flashy but smooth, with a play toward coffee, blackberry, chocolate and herbs. Dense and deep; very nice Merlot."
Red Blend,South Africa,Swartland,Spice Route,24.0,91.0,"Chakalaka is always a bold and powerful selection, and the 2012 follows suit, with dense notes of black berry, plum and cherry that are framed by hints of lavender, licorice, laurel and celery seed. The medium-bodied palate offers spicy notes of pepper and bittersweet cocoa, with a lingering espresso tinge on the finish. A blend of 29% Syrah, 29% Mourvèdre, 13% Grenache, 13% Carignan, 8% Tannat and 8% Petite Sirah."
White Blend,US,California,Miller Wine Works,24.0,91.0,"A smoky stony mineral element gives this Rhône-style blend an unorthodox, austere but fascinating personality. Those earthy qualities meet crisp reserved grapefruit and white peach on the palate where a tangy and at first slightly astringent texture warms up to reveal a richer lingering finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,24.0,91.0,"This exceptional release is firm and focused, with lip-smacking acidity. Tart apple and tangy limeade pack the core flavors, underscored with wet-stone minerality."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,24.0,91.0,"Pure, poised citrus lift combines pink and yellow grapefruit peel on the nose, with more cushioning on the textured, concentrated palate. A stony, mineral background plays against the lively, bright acid that leaves you wanting more."
Red Blend,Chile,Maule Valley,Chilensis,24.0,91.0,"This six-grape blend is led by Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of toasty, rooty berry fruits come with an essence of cola. The palate is layered and mellow, offering mild tannins. An oaky flavor profile includes coconut and vanilla, while the finish is spicy, mildly herbal and a touch chocolaty."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Schoffit,24.0,91.0,"Honeysuckle richness and lemon freshness vie for attention on the nose. The palate comes in with lots of concentration and very pithy, almost bitter texture as well as residual sweetness. Together they create balance and a very intense tangy finish and leave a lasting impression."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Venta del Puerto,24.0,91.0,"This blend of Syrah, Tempranillo, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot shows the upside potential of Valencia, one of Spain's low-profile regions. A nice mix of vanilla, root beer, spice, plum and chocolate aromas reflect 18 months in oak. With full stout tannins and deep ripe flavors of plum, cassis, tobacco and chocolate, this barrel-influenced middleweight should age nicely through 2022."
Chardonnay,US,California,Talley,24.0,91.0,"A sharp brine character gets warmer boosts from underlying pear, nectarine and buttered sourdough aromas. Flavors are light and bright at first, with sandy clay, vanilla cookie and custard strudel emerging on the midpalate and a line of acidity down through the finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Weszeli,24.0,91.0,"So refreshing and fruity, this is so drinkable now. It's bright with crisp white fruits, floral perfume and lively acidity. There is also a more serious, structured side which suggests it could age so drink a few now, but save a few bottles to enjoy through 2019. Glass stopper"
Chardonnay,Australia,South Australia,Cape Barren,24.0,91.0,"This is a fairly big, creamy-textured Chardonnay to consume over the next couple of years. Grilled sweet corn features, but it's backed by ample citrus and peach fruit, and the finish remains crisp and refreshing."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Vallobera,24.0,91.0,"Smooth berry and plum aromas are attractive. This feels tight and balanced, with good depth. Layered plum, raspberry, vanilla and cocoa flavors finish juicy and energetic, with length and a secure sense of quality. Drink through 2019."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaj,Gróf Degenfeld,24.0,91.0,"This Furmint from Tokaj has enticing aromas of lemon, grapefruit peel and vanilla bean. There are lively flavors of lemon curd, dried sage and caramelized apricot in the palate with balanced minerality in the finish."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Gini,24.0,91.0,"From a single vineyard's old vines, here is a full, very rich wine, packed with flavors of almonds and ripe nuts. Layers of wood give it a toasty character, but never one that dominates the quality fruit."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Trimbach,24.0,91.0,"Powdery, creamy notes of rose, orange and mandarin oil unite in a concentrated, punchy palate that focuses on taste rather than aroma. This is rounded and rich with an immensely concentrated phenolic vein that lends structure and poise. The finish is lasting but demure."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre,24.0,91.0,"Bailly Lapierre regards this full-bodied rich Pinot Noir as its signature wine. It has a cool, northern feel to it, but it also has powerful red-berry fruits, a firm structure, a final layer of acidity and a sense this is a wine as well as a Crémant."
Chardonnay,US,California,Stephen Ross,24.0,91.0,"Green pear, candied lemon rinds, sharp lime pith and a bit of struck-match smoke arise on the nose of this appellation blend from the veteran winemaker, one of the few working inside the city limits of San Luis Obispo. There's lots of clean, fresh energy on the palate, powered by flavors of green apple skins, Mexican lime juice, a pinch of dill and a flash of butter on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,24.0,91.0,"This is a very zesty Grüner where yeasty, earthy notes are completely cut through with the wonderful, bracing freshness of grapefruit peel. The more usual fruit of green pears lurks underneath but the overall picture is one of lip-smacking refreshment. Wonderfully clean and zingy finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Stephan Ehlen,24.0,91.0,"Thick, oily and sweet, this wine is clearly not a typical spätlese. Dried apricots, baked apple and dried spices coat the palate, finishing long and sweet but with just enough lime-like acidity for balance. Drink now–2020. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,O. Fournier,24.0,91.0,"A lively, well-made blend of Tempranillo, Malbec and Syrah; B Crux is a bouncy, fresh youngster but still a serious wine with rock-solid black fruit, deep chocolate and spicy length. It's not super oaky as only half the wine sees new barrels, but you can definitely taste some wood. Will drink best in 2009–2010."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Dutton Estate,23.0,91.0,"Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like. Stainless-steel fermentation gives it a lean underbelly, rounded out by sharp Meyer lemon and tangerine, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity. Green apple and an accent of honey peak on the finish."
Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon,France,Loire Valley,Château la Varière,23.0,91.0,"Complex and concentrated, this blend of Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon has weight and richness. The red and black fruits are layered with firm, dry tannins that promise aging. It is rich, the Cabernet Franc showing its characteristic smoky perfumes. Keep for 3–4 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château le Pey,23.0,91.0,"This Cru Bourgeois estate has produced a structured wine that is still showing strong wood-aging flavors. Toasty as well as ripely fruity, it has firm tannins and good aging potential. The aftertaste is fruity and spicy. Drink from 2019."
Viognier,Portugal,Alentejano,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos,23.0,91.0,"Named after a mistress of King João V of Portugal, this beautiful, ripe wine is packed with apricot and juicy mango flavors as well as just the right amount of acidity. It's a rich wine, full in the mouth and generous. The finish has some freshness, although it is the broad flavors that stand out. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Clement et Florian Berthier,23.0,91.0,"From flinty soil, this wine shows a strongly mineral character and even a smoky edge. It is structured and tight, ripe with yellow fruits as well as citrus. A complex wine, it's impressive and ready to age a few months. Drink from 2017."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,La Tordera,23.0,91.0,"Enticing scents of honeysuckle, jasmine and orchard fruit mingle together while the bone-dry savory palate offers apple, pear and tangerine. An elegant perlage and vibrant acidity lend finesse and freshness while a hint of thyme closes the crisp finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Norton,23.0,91.0,"Once again, this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend from Norton excels. The nose is a bit grapy and candied, but there's depth and a level of intensity that bodes well for the future. The palate is deep and concentrated, with blackberry, prune, stewed plum, graphite and coffee flavors in front of a mellow, smooth finish.  Drink now through 2016."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Bodegas Mähler-Besse,23.0,91.0,"Super smooth and complete on the nose, with black fruit, toasty oak and earth notes rolled into a nice whole. It's lush, plump and balanced, with full blackberry, raisin, chocolate and spice flavors resting in front of a mellow, spicy finish. A pretty, balanced blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon that shows Jumilla at its best."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Saracina,23.0,91.0,Floral and wet-stone aromas are followed by tangy kiwi and jicama flavors keeping to a nicely dry profile. This distinctive wine from extremely consistent Saracina has bracing acidity and good concentration but remains on the subtle side.
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Thieuley,23.0,91.0,"Thieuley's vineyard is on a ridge in the heart of Entre-deux-Mers. This top white cuvée, with its light wood aging, shows the wonderful freshness of the vintage while also giving some rich, full white fruits, spice and a smooth, creamy texture."
Tempranillo,US,Oregon,Abacela,23.0,91.0,"Fiesta is the lightest, most fruit forward of the four different Tempranillos from Abacela. In a great year such as this, it's also substantial and authoritative, with deeply driven flavors of red and blueberry fruit, a whiff of oak and slightly grainy tannins. This wine clearly over-delivers for the price."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Château d'Orschwihr,23.0,91.0,"Though not indicated as such on its label, this is a sweet wine. It has spiced, ripe fruit flavors, notably pear, which are deliciously laced with honey and cinnamon notes. There is also a fine streak of lively acidity that keeps this very fresh."
Rosé,France,Provence,Mas de Cadenet,23.0,91.0,"This attractive sunset-pink colored wine has light acidity along with its rich, structured fruit. This is as serious as rosé gets, with red plum and berry fruits supported by a concentrated texture and acidity. It could age, so drink towards the end of 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Picoron,23.0,91.0,"Perfumed wood and black fruit aromas lead the way in this delicious wine. It's rich but still firm, with fine juicy fruit that will come through with time. Packed with tannins, it will be ready to drink from 2021."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Castelmaure,23.0,91.0,"More lush and internationally styled than their La Pompadour, the Grande Cuvée offers rich notes of creamy vanilla, jammy raspberry and blackberry, crushed violets and orange peel all graced with a mentholated lift. Big and velvety in the mouth, the long finish reveals seductive notes of black pepper and soft sweet spice."
Prunelard,France,France Other,Domaine des Terrisses,23.0,91.0,"Prunelard (or Prunelart) is a Gaillac grape that had almost disappeared. Revived by a few enterprising producers, it produces a distinctly fruity, aromatic wine. This bottling's firm edge of tannins and juicy acidity contribute structure and intense fruitiness. Still bursting with youth, it should be aged for another year. Drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,23.0,91.0,"Green apple, peardrop and Conference pear shine on the nose of this wine. The streamlined palate clebrates those fresh flavors, highlighting them with extra lemon spritz, a salty, yeasty fringe adding complexity. The finish is lip-smacking, moreish and dry."
White Blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Stift Klosterneuburg,23.0,91.0,"A tender, floral aroma hovers over the glass in this typical Viennese field blend. The fresh, brightly toned palate sings with a host of flavors: crisp green apple, fragrant grape, zesty citrus and juicy yellow pear. A phenolic, spicy edge gives it depth and appeal. A real glassful of Vienna that's dry and delicious."
Merlot,US,Washington,Barrister,23.0,91.0,"An aromatic, seductive wine, scented with smoke and chocolate, cedar and strawberry. Thick and chewy, with ripe raspberry fruit and a liquorous, barrel-inflected finish. This is a big wine for those who like sheer power, in both fruit and tannins."
Merlot,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,23.0,91.0,"This is a carefully made, almost calculated wine that showcases controlled herbaceousness around tight, crisp black fruits. The mix evokes earth, herb, barrel and grape."
Viognier,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,23.0,91.0,"A flood of delicious, sweet/sour floral and citrus flavors sweeps across the palate, a lush compound of satsuma orange and highlights of honeysuckle, Meyer lemon and apricot. It's a tart and vivid wine, with lovely concentration and no rough edges."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Clayhouse,23.0,91.0,"A solid and nuanced sip of this varietal for a fair price, this bottling of older vines from Paso's eastern flanks shows plump elderberry and cedar on the elegant nose. A smoked-chocolate flavor hits the palate, bolstered by blackberry syrup, white pepper, bay leaf and dried basil, with plenty of both tannin and acid."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Château Vitallis,23.0,91.0,"Crisp, tight and mineral, this classic wine has citrus and apple fruits filled out with creamed pear. The zingy texture is still young and vibrant. With intense acidity at the end, the wine could still develop, so drink from early 2017."
Riesling,New Zealand,Central Otago,Felton Road,23.0,91.0,"This bold, off-dry Riesling is loaded with flavors of poached pear and baked apple, with a lavish dusting of dried spices adding complexity. Tongue-tingling acidity provides great balance and lengthens the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Ternion,23.0,91.0,"Distinctive aromatic qualities mark this afforable bottling, an exclusive for Hawaiian supermarket chain Foodland from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton. The aromas recall chaparral scrub, mint tea and black sage. The herbaceousness continues on the palate, with a sticky tannic structure. Not exactly the wine for those seeking a red fruit experience, but good for those seeking the savory side of the grape."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Burgenland,Höpler,23.0,91.0,"Made from very ripe grapes harvested as late as November, this Grüner shows us depth despite its light, fresh palate. Creamy notes of yellow plum have the softest touch of vanilla. This has a pliable, sinuous body and is a more thoughtful, rounded but still very fresh rendition of this enduring Austrian favorite."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Adegas Gran Vinum,23.0,91.0,"Mineral and citrus aromas are on the money. Peach and citrus flavors are clean and snappy on the palate, finishing with fresh acidity and a reprise of lime and minerally notes."
White Blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Stift Klosterneuburg,23.0,91.0,"Lemon and pear take center stage on the nose while the palate presents zesty freshness and wonderful texture. While these Viennese field blends are wonderfully varied, they always are fresh and textured, joyful and food friendly. This wine will lend energy to any repast with its clarion calls of freshness and verve."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,23.0,91.0,"Semi-sweet in style with a ripe, intensely fruity palate, this delicate little Riesling is surprisingly complex with layers of wax, honey and lemon-pith that reverberate on a brisk, minerally palate."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Shannon Ridge,23.0,91.0,"Drenched with dark and rich fruit flavors as well as velvety and thick tannins, this is a bold and mouth-coating wine that still carries off a bit of polish. A hint of sweetness helps the immense structure soften around the edges and lets dark chocolate and cassis liqueur flavors come through. Drink now through 2020."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Vercingetorix VX,23.0,91.0,"Quince, orange, pink grapefruit and other citrus fruits are rounded off with a slight suggestion of residual sugar. There's a touch of almond in the finish, which lingers gracefully."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Turcaud,23.0,91.0,"At this stage, strong wood-influenced flavors dominate the fruit of this smooth-textured wine. It has the weight to stand up to the wood, so expect this wine to develop into a rich, creamy, lightly spicy wine in 2–3 years."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium,23.0,91.0,"Intensely mineral tones of slate and granite radiate against a backdrop of blossom, grapefruit and peach in this classic Mosel kabinett. Zesty and spry, it's irresistibly inviting, sip after sip after sip."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,23.0,91.0,"An aromatic twist of passion fruit plays on the nose of this dry wine. The slender palate leads with tangerine, lemon and grapefruit peel flavors, oozing verve and focused, zesty citrus notes. It has loads of vigor and provides ideal refreshment."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Greywacke,23.0,91.0,"Veteran Kevin Judd has turned out another fine effort. Passion fruit and pea tendril aromas impart a welcome green edge that's never overwhelming, picking up layers of white grapefruit on the plump, medium-bodied palate. The finish is intense, long and citrusy."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Winzer Krems,23.0,91.0,"Smooth and rich, this shows notes of apricot, intense pepper and spice, with a dry, firm structure. There is a tangy orange zest character that gives some tightness, suggesting it can age."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château la Gordonne,23.0,91.0,"Named after the chapel of Château la Gordonne, which is an historic monument, this wine is a rich rendition of ripe red fruits and a generous texture. It is concentrated, with a tannic edge that gives bite to the aftertaste. It could even age a few months and will be great with the Thanksgiving turkey."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Greywacke,23.0,91.0,"This wine captures the passion fruit notes typical of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, then underscores them with a silky textural element. Hints of white nectarine and celery stalk add nuance to the long, white-grapefruit-inflected finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Cavatappi,23.0,91.0,"A blend of Sangiovese (38%), Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine displays each in turn with aromas and flavors of dried herbs, coffee, tobacco and cherry. The style is reserved, with plenty of fruit and acid but subtle oak—perfect for the dinner table."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Quintas de Melgaço,23.0,91.0,"Ripe Alvarinho from its home turf in the Minho Valley, this wine is immediately attractive while also having a more serious intent. There is a crisp apple edge to this textured wine along with a creamy character that makes it both smooth and intense. Drink this from early 2018."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,23.0,91.0,"Yellow peach, honeysuckle and russet pear combine in a very inviting nose. The palate amalgamates these flavors even more, bathing them in tangy but sightly sweet orange notes. The result is a bullet of flavor and freshness, balanced, friendly and very moreish. The finish is off dry and wonderfully clean and spicy."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Harmony Cellars,23.0,91.0,"Numerous lively aromas kick off this bottling, from black currant and purple flower to savory smoke and black peppercorn. The palate is framed by buoyant acidity and chalky tannins, which hold up rich black cherry, clove, licorice and mocha flavors."
Malbec,Argentina,Other,Fabre Montmayou,23.0,91.0,"Fabre Montmayou has excelled in the value department, but this higher-end Patagonian Malbec signals a new benchmark for this French-owned winery. This is dark and inky, with a crusty, blackened essence. Ripe black-fruit flavors come with chocolate, spice and licorice accents that run through a long, generous finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Tour des Gendres,23.0,91.0,"This well-balanced, deliciously ripe wine is full of black fruit, dark tannins and crisply textured acidity. A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, it's juicy and rich while also poised and stylish. The wood aging shows slightly at the end, along with dry tannins, so it needs to age further. Drink from 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,23.0,91.0,"This is a ripe, bold wine from the nature reserve vineyards of Companhia das Lezirias. Packed with berry fruits, the wine is produced from organically grown grapes, rich in both tannins and acidity. Spice, soft tannins and a fresh aftertaste all make this a delicious wine that's ready to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Larose-Trintaudon,23.0,91.0,"One of the largest vineyards in the Médoc and just outside Pauillac, this estate is also one of the most reliable. This vintage is finely structured with just the right amount of tannin to support the black and red-berry fruits. Fruity and juicy, it should be ready to drink from 2020."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château la Mascaronne,23.0,91.0,"Meant by the producer to be drunk all year (Quat'Saisons means four seasons), this ripe and rounded wine will go as well with a light summer lunch as with turkey at Thanksgiving. The fruit shows gently, warmly and with just the right amount of fresh acidity."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de la Terrière,23.0,91.0,"A smoothly ripe wine, with swathes of cherry and black currant fruits balanced by lively acidity. The wine, with its richness and the tannic structure, could well age for 3-4 years, although its fruitiness makes it delicious now."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Marisco Vineyards,23.0,91.0,"Unlike Marisco's 2015 The Ned Late Harvest, this is a botrytis-affected wine, featuring a darker color and more complex flavors. The aromas suggest Earl Grey tea and honey; the flavors resemble caramel-drizzled orange segments. A slightly bitter citrus-pith note marks the finish, providing balance."
Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,US,Washington,Cadaretta,23.0,91.0,"A blend of 75% Sauvignon Blanc and 25% Sémillon, this definitely reflects the cool 2011 vintage in its steely tension. The clean green-fruit flavors are well defined and highlighted with notes of grassy herbs and saline minerality."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier,23.0,91.0,"Blending Duras, Braucol and Syrah, this is a powerful wine, perfumed and dominated by tannins from fruit and wood. There is a great juiciness as well, with the black cherry and black currant fruits bursting around the mouth. For aging—allow at least 5–6 years."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Pfalz,August Kesseler,23.0,91.0,"Intensely ripe black-cherry aromas are matched with a fresh and juicy and yet remarkably elegant palate. Delicate tannins and a lean, granitic edge frame the lingering finish. It's a brisk, balanced wine to enjoy now through 2018."
Chardonnay,Bulgaria,Danube River Plains,Chateau Burgozone,23.0,91.0,"Pale straw in the glass, this wine has a nose of pineapple and lemon blossom with a strong dose of vanilla. It is round and full in the mouth, with rich flavors of green apple, guava and tropical fruits with a slight hint of toast that carry on through the long-lasting finish."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Zull,23.0,91.0,"Classically perfumed Riesling, very floral, with white flower aromas and a star fruit and kiwi flavors. There is a definite texture here, an edge of fruit skins, with Mandarin orange acidity to give a vibrant finish."
Syrah,Chile,Limarí Valley,Maycas del Limari,23.0,91.0,"One of Chile's more personality-driven Syrahs is Maycas, from Limarí. It's a condensed, meaty and structured wine with mineral, toast and ribald blackberry aromas. The palate is rich but well built, with plum, berry, herb and chocolate flavors. Warm and long on the finish, and layered. Sophisticated enough to give the world's better-made Syrahs a run for their money."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,C. von Nell-Breuning,23.0,91.0,"Intensely ripe, almost tropical shades of pineapple, mango and cantaloupe are calibrated by shimmering minerality and spine-tingling acidity in this bristling spätlese. It's delightfully honeyed and juicy, but nuanced and penetrating too. Notes of hibiscus nectar and tangerine linger long through the finish."
Syrah,Chile,Marchigue,Polkura,23.0,91.0,"Dark and smoky, aromas of ripe blackberry and cassis come with a hint of oaky vanilla and tobacco. A lively, alert, bright palate is dense but balanced, with plum and blackberry flavors followed by notes of chocolate, toast, herbs, pencil lead and baked black fruits. Drink through 2019."
Petite Sirah,Israel,Israel,Dalton,23.0,91.0,"This inky garnet-colored wine offers a bouquet of blueberry and aniseed. It is well made, with ever-so-slightly chewy tannins and flavors of black cherry, blackberry, licorice and violet that culminate in an anise-laden finish."
Albariño,US,California,Longoria,23.0,91.0,"This lively, vibrantly young sipper kicks off with generous aromas of pineapple sherbet and peach brioche. A racy energy dominates the bright palate, with crisp pear fruit, lime juice tang and white rock minerality. An excellent partner for oysters or sashimi, but drink now, for the lovely energy may quickly evaporate."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Husch,23.0,91.0,"Enticing oak spices in the aromas and deftly blended fruit, spice and mineral flavors make this wine especially appealing. It's medium bodied, not a monster, and combines ripe black-cherry flavors, moderate tannins, muted acidity and a velvety mouthfeel."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,BiancaVigna,23.0,91.0,"Enticing aromas of citrus, spring blossom and white stone fruit set the tone on this elegant sparkler. Bright and polished, the silky palate offers Bartlett pear and green apple alongside vibrant acidity and a silky perlage."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Western Australia,Howard Park,23.0,91.0,"Appropriately restrained and even a bit austere, this is a firm, dusty-textured Cabernet. Vanilla, tobacco and cherry notes start things off and extend through the long finish. It offers at least a decade of aging potential at a very reasonable price. Drink 2020–2030."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,23.0,91.0,"Barrel-fermented and aged sur lie for 10 months, this elegant Chardonnay offers immaculate scents and flavors of lemon rind and pith, a dusting of spice, and a generous slice of ripe apple. It's full and luscious in the mouth, with appealing texture, barrel toast and just a pat of butter in the finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Roubine,23.0,91.0,"Packed with red fruits, it shows structure and concentration. A mineral texture brings out the freshness of the fruit while also giving complexity. It could benefit from aging, so wait until the end of 2014."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,23.0,91.0,"This dainty off-dry Riesling is marked by aromas—ripe stone fruit and florals against a backdrop of tea leaves and crushed minerals. On the palate, it's intensely juicy, with flavors of orange, mango and peach, but with a streak of acidity that ripples the tongue."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Colterenzio,23.0,91.0,"This savory Pinot Grigio has a little weight on it thanks to grape selection and 20% aging in large barrels. It delivers classic Granny Smith apple, Bartlett pear, nutmeg and flint in a creamy texture brightened by fresh acidity."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,23.0,91.0,Citrus blossoms are coated in honey and peach nectar in this sunny deeply concentrated Kabinett. It's off-dry in style yet balanced by a luminous streak of tangerine acidity that drives the finish long and dry. It's a bristling revitalizing sip.
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca El Origen,23.0,91.0,"Berry and cassis aromas are spicy and powerful, with integrated oak in support. This solid, tough wine features rugged but fair tannins. Savory berry, baked notes, leather and herbal flavors are very Cabernet-ish, while the finish is dry, firm and tannic. Age this until 2017–2022, or decant if drinking now."
Rosé,France,Provence,Ravoire et Fils,23.0,91.0,"This is a rich wine that is full of spicy aromatic fruit. It is classy and elegant while having some weight. Red fruits and orange zest are given a perfumed herbal edge from the Mourvèdre in the blend. This is real food wine, ready to drink."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Salomon-Undhof,23.0,91.0,"Ripe yellow plum pervades the nose of this wine. The palate brings more Grüner Veltliner savoriness, with hints of yeast and herb. Light in body and dry in mouthfeel, it refreshes with a lovely herbal citrus tang on the finish."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Adegas Gran Vinum,23.0,91.0,"Pure apple, peach and melon aromas precede a fresh, tangy palate with depth, minerality and complexity. Tangerine and lemon-lime flavors are pure as glacial ice, while lime and apple flavors control the finish. Drink through summer 2016."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Mulderbosch,23.0,91.0,"Mike Dobrovic, winemaker at Mulderbosch, coaxes a blend of open rich fruit with a spine of steel from his fruit. The wine is definitely New World in style with its creamy wood flavors, yet it also has the ability to age, which is more Burgundian in character."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Quintas de Melgaço,23.0,91.0,"From the northern Portuguese heartland of Alvarinho, this beautifully ripe and rich wine is packed with intense perfumes of white peach and green apple. Fresh fruit and crisp acidity give a lively, tangy aftertaste. Drink from late 2015."
Rosé,US,Washington,Waters,23.0,91.0,"All Syrah, this pale copper-colored wine offers very pretty aromas of watermelon, pear and cherry. The palate is elegantly styled, dry, fresh and vibrant with spritely acidity and a drawn-out, citrus-filled finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lachini,23.0,91.0,"Though not indicated on the label, this is sourced from a single vineyard in the Columbia Gorge AVA. Cool-site flavors abound, from the lemony fruit to the snappy acidity. The wine did not go through secondary malolactic fermentation, yet shows a tasty streak of butterscotch running through its core."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Rocim,23.0,91.0,"This is a super-ripe, still very young wine. It's showing all its concentrated fruits, wood aging flavors and dense texture as well as the firm tannins that will allow it to age. With its combination of black plum skin, blackberry and dark concentration, leave the wine until 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Moniker,23.0,91.0,"This elegant wine combines subtle nutmeg and cardamom aromas with crisp apple, bosc pear and mild vanilla-bean flavors. Its firm texture and lingering finish bring everything into balance, with no single element overpowering the others, making it a pleasure to sip."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Jean-Luc Baldès,23.0,91.0,"This is beautifully structured, packed with black fruits, ripe tannins and balanced acidity. It's still young, showing the black fruit side of Malbec, but the tannins are already integrating well into the structure. Age for 4–5 years."
Chardonnay,US,California,Force of Nature,23.0,91.0,"Those who buy this wine because it has a cool label will not be disappointed by the fresh 'n' clean aromas of lemon rind, chalk, nectarine, pink peach and lemonade. The tight and bright palate is also a plus, with a limestone character cutting the ripe apple fruit, proving even-keeled and easy to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,VML,23.0,91.0,"Grapefruit rind jumps out of the glass in this vivid, balanced and refreshing white that also carries a complex mix of lime, more grapefruit and the tiniest suggestion of fresh-cut grass. A creaminess to the texture rounds things out and soothes the edges."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Brandl,23.0,91.0,"Gentle hints of fragrant orange and soft hints of ripe mandarin grace the nose and palate. Despite all the precision, there is a gentleness to the way these heady citrus flavors are expressed. The palate adds ample lemon freshness, a slender body and a clean finish."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Scharffenberger,23.0,91.0,"A majority Pinot Noir (54%), this brut rosé has a healthy head of mousse followed by succulent strawberry flavor, bright acidity and a smooth finish. Dark golden-peach in color, it is layered and well-made, and a great value for the quality."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Andrew Rich,23.0,91.0,"Pretty and plump, this is bursting with ripe cherry fruit. Highlights include a dusting of cocoa powder, and the wine sits perky on the palate with fine-grained tannins and ample acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,CARM,23.0,91.0,"A fine, ripe wine, very elegant, with its red plum and berry fruits rounded out with smooth wood flavors. The tannins, obviously here, are in a supporting role to this delicious fruit. And the aftertaste is long, rounded and soft."
Riesling,US,California,Waxwing,23.0,91.0,"There is light melon fruit to the nose of this wine, but its aromatics are mostly about minerality, with wet river stones and rainy cement notes most prominent. The head-trained, organically farmed and very old vines contribute a bright, zesty, nearly overpowering acidity to the palate, where pear skins and tangy kumquat flavors hold a laser-sharp line."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Vicentin,23.0,91.0,"Gentle scents of perfume, wild berry and cedar blend seamlessly on the nose. The palate is more punchy and tight, with heavy extraction creating narrow flavors of blackberry and cassis. A short, sinewy finish limits the wine's breadth."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quevedo,23.0,91.0,"A ripe, tannic and herbal wine, this has been produced for aging. It shows a dark tannic side over the juicy black plum fruits and berry flavors. The wood aging shows in the way the wine smoothes out at the end, leaving a rich, full-bodied aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
Tempranillo-Syrah,US,Oregon,Dominio IV,23.0,91.0,"This biodynamic vineyard delivers a robust mix of flavors for the price. Licorice, coffee liqueur, smoke, char and chocolate-coated cherries are all included. The wine seems to float across the palate, without much weight, but the flavors persist, clean and interesting. Principally, it's Tempranillo (81%), but the Syrah pulls it together."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Andrew Rich,23.0,91.0,"A vertical red stripe reads “Twentieth Anniversary” along the left side of the front label. One suspects that such a milestone receives special care, and this certainly shows it. Aromatic with scents of cherries and blossoms, this is supported on a firm, almost steely frame of acid and tannin, and dotted with hints of herb and seed and grain. It's not a big wine, but given its chance, should age gracefully for up to a decade."
Albariño,US,California,Mariposa,23.0,91.0,"This bottling combines the variety's zippy character with a touch of ripeness, which makes it accessible to many palates. Aromas of fresh-cut apple and green papaya meet with a very stony minerality on the nose. The palate's powerful texture and sizzling acidity carry riper flavors of Gala apple and Anjou pear that continue deep into the finish."
Auxerrois,Germany,Baden,Wöhrle,23.0,91.0,"Delicate spice, nut and smoke tones accent juicy grapefruit and blossom in this dry, full-bodied white. Zesty lime acidty cuts a graceful edge on the midpalate, exposing a spry, mineral finish. Ready now, but will hold till 2021."
Fiano,Italy,Southern Italy,Ciro Picariello,23.0,91.0,"Delicious and linear, this full-bodied, elegant wine has a subtle nose of white flower, grapefruit and flint. The fresh palate delivers nectarine, lemon zest, rosemary, sage and mineral. This will develop more complexity; drink through 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Trione,23.0,91.0,"Grassy lime, kiwi and crème brûlée provide succulence and substance to this wine, surrounded refreshingly by ebullient acidity. Fermented in stainless steel, it was then aged minimally in neutral French oak. The wood provides firm structure without getting in the way of the fruit."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Robert Karcher et Fils,23.0,91.0,"Funky notes of earth and wet hay join apple and grapefruit on the nose. They come together on a zesty palate that focuses on lemon and grapefruit peel, surrounded by rounder, richer elements of ripe stone fruit, hay and honey. Lovely and very individual, this wine simply grows on you."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Scharffenberger,23.0,91.0,"This is a classy bottle of bubbly from the light copper color to the lightly fruity, yeasty aromas to the crisp mouthfeel and satisfying spice and raspberry flavors. A sense of layered richness is balanced by good acidity for balance."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Vigneau-Chevreau,23.0,91.0,"Produced from organic grapes, the wine is beautiful and honey touched. Its acidity keeps crispness while the fruit shines with lemon and creamed-apple flavors. Drink from 2018."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Viña Las Perdices,23.0,91.0,"Leather and earth aromas are just part of the meaty, roasted, lightly charred bouquet. The palate is thick and jammy, with savory, roasted flavors of berry fruit, pepper and leather. Finishes with chocolate and a fine texture. Impressive despite having a light herbal streak. 500 cases made."
Syrah,Portugal,Tejo,Pinhal da Torre,23.0,91.0,"This is a rich, smooth wine, full of both dark black fruits and acidity. The fruit character dominates, sustained by the toasty wood. It is still young with its baby fruit crispness. Drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Niepoort,23.0,91.0,"From its youth, this is obviously an ageworthy wine. The tannins, firm black-fruit flavors and intense acidity all point to this wine's longevity. It shows great balance, with its fruit melding into its dry structure. A beautifully polished wine."
Chardonnay,Italy,Central Italy,Castello della Sala,23.0,91.0,"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this opens with enticing scents of ripe orchard fruit, yellow flower and a whiff of dried herb. The elegantly structured palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, tropical fruit and citrus zest while a hint of ginger adds depth. Fresh acidity gives it balance and lifts the lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca El Origen,23.0,91.0,"Earthy and ripe, this midnight-black Cab opens with ripe aromas of prune, tobacco and oak-related coconut. A tannic, resiny palate deals rich, heady flavors of mocha, blackberry and coconut, while an oak-dominated finish heaps on a final dose of coconut along with hard tannins. Drink through 2021."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Vignobles Bulliat,23.0,91.0,"Named after the street where the winery stands, this is jammy and ripe while also structured with some firm tannins. Rich and juicy red-berry fruits have both crisp acidity and a dense texture. It should be drunk from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Willi Haag,23.0,91.0,"Delicate notes of white grapefruit and crushed minerals on the nose of this sprightly spätlese intensify on the palate, amassing layers of sweet peach, tangerine and caramel flavors. It's an richly concentrated wine calibrated by zesty acidity and a delicately astringent finish."
Pinot Gris,Canada,British Columbia,Township 7,23.0,91.0,"Rich and creamy, this barrel-fermented (in neutral oak) wine has appealing flavors of pear tart, grapefruit and coconut cream pie. The bracing acids compensate for all the lush creamy flavor, and the result is darn near irresistible."
Syrah,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,23.0,91.0,"Dark and roasted scents introduce this firm, tannic, rather muscular Syrah. There is a citrusy acidity underscoring the mix of mineral, earth and brambly berry, along with a slight suggestion of bacon fat. This has the fine-tuned structure to age for another half decade or longer."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Tement,23.0,91.0,"Beautifully ripe, almost luscious notes of yellow plum complement leafy varietal notes. The palate has that same juxtaposition of ripe generosity and focused freshness but remains toned, slender and superclean throughout. Lip smacking and very refreshing."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Fischer,23.0,91.0,"Moss and citrus join the Conference-pear flavors on the nose. The palate tingles with citrus freshness and has edges of white pepper, savory yeast and salty soy. The flavors are mouthfilling but wonderfully light on a zesty, slender and refreshing palate."
Red Blend,US,California,Oso Libre,23.0,91.0,"Sautéed red cherries, hazelnut and pipe-smoke scents show on the nose of this blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah. It's tangy on the sip with pickled red-fruit flavors. It also shows fudge with cherry syrup, cappuccino and mocha flavors."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Wunsch & Mann,23.0,91.0,"Earthy notes of forest floor and white field mushroom precede the fruitier notions of ripe fresh and dried pear on nose and palate. This wine has a balm-like quality to the texture and a depth of developed flavor. The dried apple finish is dry, lasting and clean."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bollig-Lehnert,23.0,91.0,"While remarkably lithe and delicate in style, this complex auslese is lusciously concentrated, with ripe peach and nectarine flavors balanced by hints of smoke, spice and musk. It's zippy and bright, with tart tangerine acidity and a wave of minerality on the finish."
Albariño,US,California,Peloton,23.0,91.0,"Fresh yellow pear, yellow grapefruit and wet river-stone aromas leap from the glass on this fresh and crisp bottling from a winery led by longtime grape grower Bill Kesselring. It's very textural on the tingling palate, where the vibrant mix of acid and tannins reveal sweet then tangy apple flavors before settling into a lime and lemon-rind groove."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Waxwing,23.0,91.0,"Pale pink in the glass, this Pinot Noir-based rosé combines nectarine and watermelon aromas with a citrus spray and rose petal quality that provides both depth and tang on the nose. There is a good charge of acidity on the palate, as well as a grippy texture, while light stone fruit, mandarin orange and lime flavors prove quite mellow yet delicious."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Tour des Gendres,23.0,91.0,"Named after Luc de Conti's father Albert, this is a structured and firm wine. It has juicy black-currant fruits that are concentrated by tannins and lifted by bright acidity. The wine is firm, impressive and aging well, although not yet ready, so drink from 2018."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Andrew Will,23.0,91.0,"Darker and more closed-up than the Ciel du Cheval bottling, this is a medium-bodied red wine with dusty cherry and cassis scents, and hints of tar, coffee, herb and leather. It's muscular and edgy, with tons of potential."
Arinto,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,23.0,91.0,"Pale gold in color, this was made in clay amphoras, giving a dry wine but one that has a honeyed edge. It is aromatic, ripe, and spicy, with an herbal character as well as good finishing acidity. Drink this limited-production wine from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,23.0,91.0,"Aged for three months on its lees in small clay amphoras, this wine has a juicy, fruity character. The red fruits and crisp acidity are impressive and fascinating. Its texture and tannins suggest further aging, so drink from 2018."
Lambrusco Grasparossa,Italy,Central Italy,Fattoria Moretto,23.0,91.0,"This wine's heady crushed grape and wild red berry aromas segue to its dry, slightly tannic palate along, with ripe blackberry and blueberry notes and savory herbal hints. It's frothy, vibrant and balanced, with firm acidity and a pleasantly bitter note on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium,23.0,91.0,"Juicy, sun-kissed grapefruits and apple blossoms explode from this buoyantly fresh, off-dry Kabinett. Invigorating acidity lends backbone and a steely focus that resonates long on the finish. It's beautiful now, but should hold nicely, and perhaps improve, through 2020."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Winzer Krems,23.0,91.0,"This is a ripe, smooth wine that has fine acidity and some intense peppery flavors. From the Wachtberg vineyard, it shows great mineral character as well as a dense texture that brings out rich fruits. Age this for another year."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Mas Blanch I Jové,23.0,91.0,"Dry, earthy and stony-smelling, this multigrape Catalonian blend also shows cherry and sandalwood scents. Fresh, tight and mildly acidic on the palate, this snappy, tasty red delivers peppery, oaky, slightly medicinal red-berry flavors in front of a composed, spicy finish with modest espresso bitterness. Drink through 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,23.0,91.0,"Notes of perfume, white peach and honeydew scent this vivacious off-dry Riesling. It's concentrated, with deep, penetrating flavors of lime and pink grapefruit that flood the palate and linger on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Thanisch,23.0,91.0,"While intensely mineral on the nose, wafting of struck flint and crushed slate, this plucky, light-footed Riesling boasts a decadently juicy, fruity palate. Honeyed tones of peach and nectarine are sumptuously sweet yet balanced neatly by a piercing strike of acidity. The finish is lavishly persistent."
Red Blend,Greece,Rapsani,Tsantali,23.0,91.0,"This appealing red starts with a nose bursting with exotic tobacco, cocoa and red berries, followed by a juicy palate of black fruit, cocoa and sweet smoke. The oak is obvious here, offering vanilla and spicy notes, but the round fruit character keeps the wine in check. Elegant and fun."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Vignobles Brumont,23.0,91.0,"Petit Manseng, found in the deep southwest, lends itself so beautifully to sweet botrytized wines. With its beautiful apricot and mango flavors, filled with honey and spice, this is a wine that is both light and rich. The acidity gives the wine a lift at the end."
Syrah,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,23.0,91.0,"The variety is unmistakable, with aromas of coffee, earth and plummy fruit. Rich flavors display a mix of fruit and barrel (45% new French and American), making it a delicious find at this price."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,22.0,91.0,"Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Maximin Grünhäuser,22.0,91.0,"Fresh green apple and grapefruit aromas are bolstered on the palate of this dry, elegantly balanced Riesling. It's light bodied yet delightfully creamy. A kiss of tangerine zest marks its moderately long finish."

Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,22.0,91.0,"Notes of ripe yellow apple play enticingly on the nose. They expand to full force on the palate and fill the mouth with their mellow goodness, supported in this by rich notes of shortbread and wonderful lemon freshness. The bubbles are creamy and disperse the lovely flavors to great effect. This is classy and delicious."
Red Blend,Chile,Rapel Valley,Lapostolle,22.0,91.0,"From a warm vintage, this blend is ripe yet still balanced, with aromas of prune, blackberry, tree bark and leather.

Blaufränkisch,Austria,Thermenregion,Stift Klosterneuburg,22.0,91.0,"Fruity hints of blueberry pie on the nose are juicy, ripe and enticing. The palate has the same generous fruit, joined by forest elements. It's a fruit-driven, juicy and ripe wine with a fresh counterpoint, a slight grip and a spicy finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,22.0,91.0,"This is a smooth and generous wine. It is rich, full-bodied and packed with dark plum flavor, but it's the ripe, velvet character that is so appealing. It's almost ready to drink, although the firm tannins and minerality at the end suggest it will be better from 2016."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Chignard,22.0,91.0,"Gamay often becomes more like Pinot Noir as it ages. That's true of this wine, which displays strawberry and spice flavors, as well as an element of minerality. The aftertaste has ripe blackberry jelly."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,22.0,91.0,"Part of King Estate's ambitious Limited Edition program for Pinot Gris, this is packaged in a hock bottle with a label styled for a European look. Slightly off dry, with residual sugar just below one percent, it's lovely with honey, tea, lemon cake and ripe, semitropical fruit flavors. Great focus and balance are in play, with perfect acidity."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lachini,22.0,91.0,"Lovely scents suggest citrus rind, lemon cake, honeycomb, candied orange and more. Substantial fruit flavors run from lime on through ripe pineapple, and the supporting structure offers a firm foundation of acid and extract, with a pleasingly long finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Chacewater,22.0,91.0,"Big flavors, lots of body and a smooth, almost thick texture make this a bold wine, yet it also has good underlying acidity to keep it from being heavy. The aroma is quite earthy when first uncorked but that goes away with airing and the buttery and ripe fruit flavors come through and stay lingering on the finish."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Citari,22.0,91.0,"Fragrant white flower, yellow stone fruit and dried herb aromas open. The vibrant, elegant palate offers mature yellow apple, creamy white peach and mineral alongside bright acidity. A white almond note closes the lingering finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Dowsett Family,22.0,91.0,"Sourced from vines planted in 1982, it's brightly aromatic with sweet floral notes, orange peel and lychee. Medium bodied, it drinks dry with abundant spice and floral flavors. A thoroughly delicious wine that begs to be paired with scallops or spicy Thai dishes."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Coeur de Terre,22.0,91.0,"Crafted principally from estate-grown fruit, this has the complexity and downright panache of a far more expensive bottling. Mixed brambly red fruits combine seamlessly, punching through to a lingering finish etched in minerals. What a terrific value!"
Zinfandel,US,California,Marietta Cellars,22.0,91.0,Floral cedary aromas and big berry-soaked flavors come together on a smooth but appropriately tannic texture as this full-bodied wine drenches the palate with blackberry and boysenberry richness. It combines power with complexity and has the grippy texture needed to carry all that ripeness. It was blended with 11% Petite Sirah and 5% Barbera.
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Denis Jamain,22.0,91.0,"From chalk soil, this wine is touched with minerality, crisp acidity and a texture that promises an ability to age. It has green plum and sliced apple flavors, fresh while also tangy. A complex wine, it will be better from late 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Philippe Raimbault,22.0,91.0,"This rich, full wine shows a strongly mineral character as well as ripe green-plum and citrus flavors. It has concentration, spice as well as fresh final acidity. The name of the wine comes from the Roman name for the producer's village, Sury-en-Vaux. It will be better if aged for a few months, so drink from early 2017."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Alta Alella,22.0,91.0,"Fresh, floral, citrusy aromas precede a well-balanced palate. Sleek, dry raspberry and plum flavors are fresh and forward, while the finish on this sparkling Mourvèdre is salty, genuine, elegant and stylish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Birot,22.0,91.0,"The wine has bold tannins, generous fruit and an excellent future. With its concentration and density, it needs time to soften. For now, the black fruit flavors are developing well, balanced with acidity and ripe tannins. Drink from 2021."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Bodkin,22.0,91.0,"Crisp, dry and searing in acidity, this 100% varietal wine is complex, showing sour lemon and brine notes, with orange blossom tones weaving their way throughout.

Grauburgunder,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,22.0,91.0,"Fresh citrus and pear flavors are highlighted by racy streaks of lime and tart pineapple in this unusually zippy Grauburgunder, or Pinot Gris. It's light in body yet creamy in texture with a long, lingering finish marked by crushed stones and salty minerality."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Quinta do Perdigão,22.0,91.0,"This is a wood-aged wine that's smooth with rounded and great fruit flavors. The wood is subtle, a hint of spice and no more, allowing the ripe apricot and citrus flavors to show strongly. It is a very fine wine, ready to drink now."
Port,Portugal,Port,W. & J. Graham's,22.0,91.0,"With its dense color and sweet fruits, this is wine that works well, with a great rich, soft texture. There is a concentrated juicy and jammy character, with final approachable spice and acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Earthworks,22.0,91.0,"The fruit flavors are plum and blackberry, with warm, meaty notes and hints of mocha and dill. The varietal character shows most in the wine's feel on the palate, which is ample but just slightly austere and restrained. Drink now–2020."
Tempranillo,US,Washington,Fall Line,22.0,91.0,"Hailing from an esteemed vineyard best known for its Syrah, this 100% varietal wine delivers notes of dried herbs, red fruit and milk chocolate. It displays a captivating, layered mouthfeel showing a lot of subtlety and balance leading to an extended finish."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,22.0,91.0,"A dense, dark-colored wine, this reveals the full power of Tannat's tannins. It also has tarry black-fruit and licorice flavors, with a foursquare chunky character. It's drinkable now, but it will be less stark in 4–5 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Schild Estate,22.0,91.0,"Despite being full bodied, this is a very drinkable example of Barossa Cabernet. It's not very tannic, but instead offers mouthwatering suppleness. Cherry and red currant fruit notes are underscored by mocha shadings."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Markus Molitor,22.0,91.0,"Whiffs of zesty lemon and fresh herbs lend vitality to rich, honeyed peach flavors on this unabashedly juicy, semi-dry Kabinett. An ideal late-summer apéritif at an excellent price, it finishes with a bracing shower of jasmine tea and lime acidity."
Rosé,US,California,Lazy Creek,22.0,91.0,"This beautifully balanced, flavorful wine combines vivid watermelon and canteloupe flavors with medium body, a rich texture and lingering finish. It has great concentration without being heavy."
Rosé,US,California,Kale,22.0,91.0,"Made from a blend of 62% Grenache and 38% Syrah, this is a classically dry, refreshingly crisp rosé, pink-salmon in color that's intense yet soft, crafted in a Provence style. The grapes come from Rutherford, Atlas Peak and Sonoma County's Kick Ranch, tasting of fresh raspberry and spring flowers, a bite of wet stone on the finish."
White Blend,US,Washington,Brian Carter Cellars,22.0,91.0,"Viognier is half the blend, with the rest Roussanne and Riesling, yielding a delightfully aromatic, lightly honeyed wine, with a lush array of ripe fruits. Apricot, papaya, pineapple and banana are all here, with supporting acidity. Overall, this is one of the most delicious and unique white wines in Washington."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Fouassier,22.0,91.0,"This is a tropical-fruited wine, with mango and sweet peach notes showing the wine's richness. As a complement, there is the taut green-fruit acidity that's bright and fresh. The two together lend a rich, yet structured wine."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,22.0,91.0,The wine is rich with a dusty tannic character. It has black-currant flavors that are packed with both fruitiness and balanced acidity. The organic grapes give a pure line of ripe fruits that are going to integrate well with the tannins. Drink starting from 2018.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,22.0,91.0,"Fermented in amphorae, the wine is rich and dense as if it had been fermented in open fermenters. The wine is ripe and very concentrated, full of black plums and generous tannins. It still needs to age, so drink from 2018."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Señorío de Sotillo,22.0,91.0,"Dense dark fruit aromas show depth, starting off a pleasant bouquet. On the palate, this wine is fresh yet lush, with earthy, lightly baked flavors of blackberry, chocolate and spice. A toasty note darkens the nuances on the narrowing finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,22.0,91.0,"Delicate floral tones build throughout this zesty off-dry Riesling. While sweet with honeydew flavor, the palate is zippy and tart with cutting notes of lime zest and pineapple. It's a classically styled Mosel kabinett at an accessible price."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Presqu'ile,22.0,91.0,"Light, clean and fresh on the nose, this bottling from a rather extremely sited vineyard on the western end of the appellation shows cut lawn, lemongrass, squeezed lime and wet concrete on the nose. The palate is zesty and sour at first, but a honeydew element warms it up nicely."
Black Muscat,US,California,Quady,22.0,91.0,"An amazingly sweet and rich wine, this has a floral aroma and great concentration. It offers layers of flavor like dried fruit, honey and boysenberry syrup, with good acidity for balance. This makes a fabulous dessert by itself and is sweet enough to conquer almost any other confection."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Grand Garant,22.0,91.0,"This is a wine that comes from a parcel of 15 acres, grown on pink granite rock. Vines that are 67 years old have given this firm wine its concentration and density. Generous, full of black fruits, the wine is developing although it needs more time. Drink from late 2017."
Friulano,Italy,Northeastern Italy,La Viarte,22.0,91.0,"Structured and savory, it offers a floral fragrance of honeysuckle, elderberry and crushed tomato vine. The juicy palate delivers tropical fruit, white peach and pineapple while crisp acidity brightens up the creamy texture."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Wines & Winemakers,22.0,91.0,"Still young, this wine brings out the ripe and creamy side of Alvarinho. Its citrus character is prominent along with a strong mineral texture. Weight from the skin contact during fermentation has produced a dense structure. Keep this wine until 2015."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Chandler Reach,22.0,91.0,"Dark, thick and aromatic, this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah can stand alongside others selling for two or three times the price. It's a supple mix of dark fruits and spicy herb; it almost bristles with sharp hints of nettle, pepper and green tea. The tannins are supple and smooth, and there is a polish to the wine that extends into a smooth, seamless and very satisfying finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sanford,22.0,91.0,"Very high-toned for a relatively affordable wine, this shows Key lime pith, Greek yogurt, scratched pink grapefruit skin and a fresh 7-Up soda liveliness on the nose. Anjou peas, seared green apples, lime zest and nectarine power the pleasant energy on the palate, which wipes up clean with a vanilla finish."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Jaspi,22.0,91.0,"Dusty spice and red-berry aromas are a fine opening to this blend of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. It's fairly full bodied but not heavy, with fine balance and bright flavors of cherry and berry that come in layered waves. A toasty, dry finish with spice and good acidity closes out this easy-to-like Spanish red. Drink through 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château l'Espérance,22.0,91.0,"Named Espérance (hope) by the South African owner, the château has produced a firm, structured wine from this exceptional vintage. It is still young, full of black-currant fruit and fresh acidity that contrast with the dark tannins that extend throughout the wine. Drink from 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Naggiar,22.0,91.0,"The first Zin reviewed from Naggiar, this is a beauty. Power and grace combine in this concentrated and well-structured wine. It smells and tastes like black cherries and blackberries with hints of cocoa and black pepper. The velvety texture delivers smoothness with a nice grip from tannins, and conveys a wonderful sense of depth."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,H. & M. Hofer,22.0,91.0,"Total fruity freshness emanates from the glass: fresh Conference pear, lemon zest and a riper notion of yellow mirabelle plum. This is utterly appetizing. The palate adds a dimension of pepper and a broader notion of yeast in the texture. This blooms with fruit and finishes on clean lemon zest and white pepper."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Limarí Valley,Maycas del Limari,22.0,91.0,"It took this Concha y Toro specialty label a few years to find its footing with Sauvignon Blanc, but in 2010 they found it. This is a subtle but chiseled wine with structure, juicy acidity and pure apple, lime and tarragon flavors. It's consistent from nose to tail, and it's deep and layered, too."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Robert Weil,22.0,91.0,"Whiffs of smoke and mineral lends complexity to pretty white peach and floral tones on this dainty off-dry Riesling. It's juicy with stone fruit, but maintains that streak of minerality and a clean, focused acidity that leads to a long, dry finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Willm,22.0,91.0,"A closed nose shows the faintest notes of quince. The palate is dry and fresh with lots of lemony zestiness. It's slender and clean with a wonderful, straightlaced backbone. Freshness and tautness signal a purposeful, lively wine, full of apple fruit and aromatic overtones of quince."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Tabor,22.0,91.0,"Dark ruby in color, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, green pepper and pomegranate. Smooth tannins provide a backdrop for flavors of black cherry, cranberry, smoke and Mediterranean herbs that recede slightly on the bright cherry finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,22.0,91.0,"Old vines give this ripe and fruity wine both concentration and a fine perfumed character. With a short six months in wood, it's smooth, creamy and rich with apricot and mango flavor, needing some aging. Drink from 2018."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,A.T. Richardson,22.0,91.0,"Dark and smoky on the nose, with meat, cedar and blackberries combining into an attractive bouquet. This is a meaty, savory wine that should drink well from 2010–2020, backed by tart blackberries and showing some dusty tannins on the finish."
Riesling,Australia,Western Australia,Leeuwin Estate,22.0,91.0,"Like an underripe nectarine, this tart, crunchy wine needs a bit time to mature. But instead of 2–3 days, think 2–3 years. Lime and mandarin orange notes are lean and crisp on the palate, austere for now, but surely going to blossom in time."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Basalt,22.0,91.0,"Malbec (46%) makes up most of this blend followed by 23% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot and finished with Cabernet Franc. It offers aromas of dark plum, currant, cocoa and spice that are followed by generous, textured and full blue and black-fruit flavors that bring a lot of hedonistic appeal. Coffee flavors linger on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,22.0,91.0,"Lithe and lean in style, this light-bodied dry Riesling offers up loads of blossomy, citrusy delight. Spine tingling lemon-lime acidity is balanced neatly against concentrated tangerine and honey flavors. The finish lingers on a pleasantly waxy cling."
Viognier,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,22.0,91.0,"This is a luscious wine with a smooth and hearty mouthfeel, ample ripe fruit reminiscent of pears and white peaches, and vanilla and honey accents on both the nose and palate. Fermented in neutral barrels, it doesn't have oaky flavors but feels soft in acidity and seems to melt in the mouth."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Martinborough,Craggy Range,22.0,91.0,"As usual, the team at Craggy Range has turned out an excellent rendering of Sauvignon Blanc from the estate vineyard in Martinborough. There's a lovely, lively interplay of stone fruit, citrus and subtle grassiness, plus a plump, silky mouthfeel and a smooth, elegant finish."
Pinot Gris,Austria,Südsteiermark,Wohlmuth,22.0,91.0,"Very subtle hints of ripe pear on the nose lead to a citrus-dominated palate that has a pleasant bitter-almond edge and a finely textured midpalate. Nonetheless, the zesty freshness is the main feature of this tricky vintage. This is Pinot Gris but not as you know it—here it has the slender verve of a stony, steep site."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Canoe Ridge,22.0,91.0,"Excellent fruit shines forth in this estate-grown Cabernet from the winery's Horse Heaven Hills vineyards. Flavors of mixed berry, black cherry and cassis carry a proper hint of fresh herb. Notations of licorice, earth and dark chocolate add depth and complexity to the elegant finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chile,Maipo Valley,Pargua,22.0,91.0,"This is an interesting six-grape blend that's not like most other Chilean specimens. It starts with a leathery note as well as eucalyptus, licorice and lightly minty fruit aromas. It feels cheeky and tannic but mature, with baked berry, raisin and chocolate flavors. Dark, spicy and chocolaty until the last remnants of the finish conclude; this needs lots of air to show its best."
Sparkling Blend,Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,Bründlmayer,22.0,91.0,"Restraint on nose and palate gently leads to citrussy concentration. This is a classy, concentrated selection, with a backbone of fine acidity and very fine, persistent bubbles—both are the must-have attributes of a good apéritif. The long, dry finish will impress those in the know."
Tannat-Cabernet Franc,Uruguay,Uruguay,Narbona,22.0,91.0,"Cherry and berry aromas are ripe, healthy and aided by peppery notes and char. This is a nonvintage blend of Tannat and Cab Franc from the southwestern Carmelo district. It's flush and thorough in feel, with dark plum, berry and spice flavors. A warm finish with spicy oak and cocoa notes is smooth and attractive; drink through 2020."
Tannat,Uruguay,Montevideo,Bouza,22.0,91.0,"If you're going to try just one Uruguayan Tannat, then let it be Bouza. This friendly, nicely balanced offering opens on forest floor and dusty berry aromas. Toasty, peppery oak lends spice notes to core berry fruit, while the finish is lush and round. Drink through 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Brassfield,22.0,91.0,"This is a spicy, complex, oak-aged and full-bodied wine instead of a simply herbal one, and it shows hints of ginger and nutmeg in the aroma leading to vibrant but subtle lemon and grapefruit flavors. The layers of spice and crisp fruit make a wonderful combination to sip and explore."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Flying Goat Cellars,22.0,91.0,"There's a slightly pink hue to this wine from Lompoc's Norman Yost. The nose is bright and minerally, with strawberry, apple cider and slight watermelon aromas. There's even more going on once sipped, with pear spritzer and citrus zest playing along with gray rocks and elements both bitter and sour. It's a refreshing take on a grape that doesn't always get the rock star treatment."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,22.0,91.0,"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine du Pegau,22.0,91.0,"The aromas of cracked peppercorns, iodine, blackberries, crushed stone, dried spices and black olives are practically intoxicating on their own. Then, on the palate, you can taste the intensity, with firm tannins that come from a patch of 50-year-old vines in Sorgues. Drink this blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault from 2017–2025, treating it almost as if it were a mini Châteauneuf-du-Pape."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Anam Cara,22.0,91.0,"This wine is beautifully rendered, with pear and melon backed by hints of citrus. The length, persistance, balance and tension are superb, and the mouth-puckering finish will have you reaching for another glass."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Pascal Aufranc,22.0,91.0,"Despite its underlying richness, this is a very structured wine, solidly based on dry tannins and firm acidity. This texture, which is also given extra liveliness by its red cherry fruits, suggests a wine for aging over 2–3 years."
Riesling,US,Washington,Gård,22.0,91.0,"This rather exotic Riesling was fermented and aged in barrels, 43% new, and the rest once-used. The barrel treatment takes it away from any ordinary Riesling characteristics, yielding a wine that has much in common with Viognier—floral and buttery, with substantial alcohol."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Mauvesin Barton,22.0,91.0,"A ripe full-bodied wine that has great structure and fine tannins. The bold red fruits are right to the front. It is a wine with great potential, generous tannins and the acidity of the vintage beautifully balanced. This wine will develop well. Drink from 2024."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine les Capréoles,22.0,91.0,"Made from the Domaine's oldest vines, this is a generous concentrated wine. With its ripe black fruits and firm tannins it is also a wine to age. It has perfumed black-cherry flavors that are enhanced and lifted by the acidity. Drink this wine from late 2017."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,22.0,91.0,"A family-owned vineyard on this famous slope in Morgon supplies the grapes to Duboeuf for the wine. It is structured and dense, full of black plum and berry flavors. Acidity cuts through the tannins, resulting in a wine that will age well. Drink from 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Ulrich Langguth,22.0,91.0,"While rich and almost nectar like in ripeness, this vibrantly peachy, floral wine is kept in check by an exhilarating strike of lime acidity. Off dry in style, it's concentrated and penetrating, yet bracingly sheer. It would be a showstopper apéritif at the most elegant cocktail party."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Groth,22.0,91.0,"This lovely expression of the grape blends in 21% Sémillon, adding a juicy, fleshy texture that's hard to forget. With a cradling of oak, it has a rich body met and balanced by crisp acidity, amid defined flavors of apple skin, melon and pineapple."
Merlot,US,Washington,Seven Hills,22.0,91.0,"Penetrating aromatically, spicy and complex, this brings in sharp berry scents, baking chocolate and a streak of herb. It's tight and vertically structured, and once in the mouth it turns a bit hard and unyielding. But it lingers and resonates, improves after being open for several hours, and can be cellared for up to a decade."
Red Blend,US,California,Rancho Sisquoc,22.0,91.0,"This blend of 42% Petit Verdot, 36% Sangiovese and 22% Merlot shows strawberry, light caramel and expressive baking-spice aromas on the nose. A powerful burst of acidity starts the palate, which combines red currant and purple-flower flavors into a very interesting and lively wine."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Johann Heinrich,22.0,91.0,"This wine is produced from fruit that was sourced from Leithaberg vineyards in the northwestern corner of Lake Neusiedlersee. It's powerful with dense tannins that accompany the bright red-fruit flavors. Acidity cuts right through the solid structure, giving it a fresh finish. Glass stopper."
Zweigelt,Austria,Burgenland,Johann Heinrich,22.0,91.0,"From the Heideboden Vineyard, this rich and fruity effort combines an intense black-plum flavor with solid tannins. It has a dark character that shows the severe side of Zweigelt. Age for 2–3 years. Glass stopper."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Barber,22.0,91.0,"Crisp and tart in lemon peel and grapefruit, the loveliest aspect of this lightly ripe wine is its sublime texture, an earthy velvety expression of fineness and elegance that persists in its delicacy."
Agiorgitiko,Greece,Nemea,Tselepos,22.0,91.0,"Cedar, berries and tobacco on the nose of this elegant red give it a moody appeal. On the palate, cherry, mocha and smoke prevail. This wine has dimension and class."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Carnuntum,Glatzer,22.0,91.0,"This is an impressive, solidly tannic wine that needs aging. The black plum flavors are still dominated by spice and wood, lending a dry and dark character to the wine. Solid with good depths of flavor, the wine should be kept for 4–5 years before opening."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,22.0,91.0,"Plenty of dark Malbec tannins here, giving a tight, mineral wine with a core of dryness. Around the core are black plum and fig fruits, and an edge of the crispest black currants. Firmly extracted, with fine wood toast flavors."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château du Galoupet,22.0,91.0,"From one of the classed growths of Provence, this wine is intense with ripe fruits. Red plum, red currant and berry fruit flavors go with a steely, nervy texture that needs to age. Drink from the end of 2014."
Rosé,US,California,Quivira,22.0,91.0,"From organically-grown and certified Biodemeter-grown grapes, this rosé blends 70% Grenache with 15% each of Mourvèdre and Syrah to produce a dry, robust wine aromatic in peach skin and tangerine. Orange blossom and candied orange peel on the palate add to the freshness and lively acidity."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,22.0,91.0,"Leesy, textural, a rich mix of spring herbs, celery, lime, green fruits and melon. Though relatively low alcohol it has a lovely mix of flavors. Bracing but not at all sour. Good winemaking."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Iris Vineyards,22.0,91.0,"Grapefruit comes to mind first upon sipping this bracing bottle. The minerality, with flavors of wet rock and an immaculate transparency, carries it along with a mix of citrus, pear and a slice of cucumber. This is a great shellfish wine."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Zuccardi,22.0,91.0,"A rich and creamy wine with good structure and plenty of fruit. The nose yields berry essence, vanilla and smoky wood notes, while the palate has depth, layering and composed flavors. There's coffee and chocolate on the finish, and the texture and length seem just right. It's oaky for sure, but this vintage of Q can handle it. Drink now through 2012."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,22.0,91.0,"Whiffs of gooseberry and tart green plums lend a zesty, green tone to this refreshingly mineral off-dry Riesling. It's a concentrated but spry wine, full of fresh lemon and lime flavors glazed by hints of wax and stony minerality. The finish is persistent, edged by a hint of bitter citrus peel."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Cà di Rajo,22.0,91.0,"Fragrant scents of spring blossom, wild flower and orchard fruit escape from the glass. Silky and elegant, the tangy palate doles out white peach, green apple and lemon drop alongside a refined perlage and refreshing acidity."
Rosé,US,California,Quivira,22.0,91.0,"Made from 62% Grenache, 15% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 8% Counoise, this perennial delight is Demeter-certified Biodynamic and tastes as fresh as a summer day. Orange, grapefruit and lemon give it a sizzling refreshment and high level of acidity, while the texture of the wine stays smooth and luxurious."
Chardonnay,US,California,Cambria,22.0,91.0,"This wine offers caramelized apple, seared pear, honeysuckle, a touch of buttercream and vanilla ice cream on the even, well-measured nose. The flavors lean more green but not underripe, with lime juice, green apple and green mango, offering some bitterness and an alkaline/iodine character."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,22.0,91.0,"This semisweet Riesling balances an intensely fruit-forward profile of ripe yellow cherry and quince flavors against a backdrop of crisp, tart tangerine acidity. It's sunny and bright, yet elegantly composed, with a bristle of fresh herb notes that linger on the finish."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Granbazán,22.0,91.0,"Lightly leesy aromas of vanilla cookie are offset by crisp minerally apple and stone-fruit scents. This is pure and lifted by fine acidity, while flavors of apple, pineapple and lemon-lime end fresh, with a distant note of citrus pith. Drink immediately."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,22.0,91.0,This barrel selection shows its wood-aged flavors strongly in a spicy toasty character. It does need time to bring out the ripe red fruits that are rich as well as crisp. Drink this serious wine with its firm tannins still intact from 2018.
Viognier,US,Washington,Gramercy,22.0,91.0,"Though coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this wine still retains its balance with notes of peach, mango and crushed granite. It's light and airy in style for a Washington Viognier without sacrificing flavor or length."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Ponzi,22.0,91.0,"This delightful rosé bursts open with ripe watermelon and strawberry scents and flavors. Highlights suggest candied rose petals, and the flavors continue into cherry soda and hints of pink peppercorn. It's a big bold fruity simply fabulous bottle."
Gelber Muskateller,Austria,Niederösterreich,Stadlmann,22.0,91.0,"Slightly creamy blossom and peach hints mark the nose of this wine. The palate is gently fruited—dry and light with a lovely aromatic aura of honeysuckle, jasmin, peach and lemon. Lithe and bright, it's perfect for a summer night."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Zull,22.0,91.0,"Fizzing lemon peel and more rounded tangerine unite on the nose but really shine on the palate which is concentrated and fruit-driven with a tangy, mandarin-like richness that sweeps to a clean, joyful finish. This is ultraclean and very racy with a glowing core of tangerine."
Malbec,US,Oregon,Silvan Ridge,22.0,91.0,"This appealing wine demonstrates the exciting potential for Malbec in Southern Oregon. Fresh, zippy acids underscore bright raspberry and black-cherry fruit, framed in chocolate with a dash of sea salt. The finish resonates with lightly applied baking spices and cayenne pepper."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Adelsheim,22.0,91.0,"Full and round, with snappy acidity that brings life and lift to the luscious fruit, this delicious wine is aimed at those who like a festival of green and yellow fruits in their glass. It has fine texture and length, with a defining mineral streak that elevates this well beyond just fruity. It has medium-term aging potential as well."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Eagle Glen,22.0,91.0,"From a multiplicity of vineyards, this wine works and is a tremendous value for the price. It mixes hot mulled-cider spices, cinnamon, clove and pine forest, conveying surprising depth. Plum, dark cherry and more clove lead to a powerful, leathery finish."
Riesling,US,California,MaidenStoen,22.0,91.0,"Winemaker Mike Callahan's small Riesling project is packed with promise. This bottling shows tight yellow grapefruit pith, wet stones, crushed sea shells and richer Key lime notes on the nose. A touch of fresh oregano flashes on the palate, alongside chalk, white flowers and lemon oil laid upon a brisk but waxy mouthfeel."
Riesling,New Zealand,Marlborough,Villa Maria,22.0,91.0,"A rich, full-bodied Riesling that's soft on the outside, but whose inner core of acids comes through on the powerful citrus-and-spice finish. Starts off with apple blossom, peach and guava aromatics that give way to ripe apple and pear flavors, layered with dried spices. Tastes good now but don't be afraid to age it—it should last easily through 2008."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Fleurie,22.0,91.0,"With vineyards spread across the top sectors of the Fleurie cru, this wine is fruity and structured at the same time. It has a dry core that is surrounded by ripe berry fruits that also hint at black cherry. The wine needs time to soften, so drink from 2018."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,22.0,91.0,The Descombes family has farmed vines in this appellation since the French Revolution and Jean-Ernest Descombes supplied one of Georges Duboeuf's first Morgon wines in 1968. The latest generation has produced a ripe and fruity wine with a balanced structure. It is dense in tannins that will soften over the next year. Drink from 2018.
Syrah,US,California,Lawer,22.0,91.0,"A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor. Enjoy it on its own or with a range of foods—its lightness begets versatility."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,South Africa,Rudera,22.0,91.0,"Rudera, derived from the Latin word rudus meaning broken fragments of stone, is a heady and deep Cab matured in French oak for 22 months. Dark and rich, there's ample cigar box spice, bramble and cocoa accents to the black fruit core. The mouth is lush, like crushed satin, with good grip and balanced acidity."
Rosé,US,California,Brick & Mortar,22.0,91.0,"Made from 64% Pinot Noir and 36% Syrah, this copper-tinged refresher is nutty and tangy with acidity. It offers deep grapefruit, mandarin orange and lime flavors that persist, please and quench on the palate, all in a compelling, complex light-bodied package."
Syrah,US,California,Morgan,22.0,91.0,"A screaming deal from Dan Lee and company, this dynamic Syrah shows plush blackberry, vanilla and caramel aromas. There's buoyant red and purple fruit on the palate, from boysenberry to black raspberry, kept fresh with lively acidity and accented with lavender and thyme."
Syrah,US,Washington,Bergevin Lane,22.0,91.0,"The best value among all of Bergevin Lane's 2008 Syrahs, this rich and smoky effort spent 20 months in oak. Sourced from Stone Tree and Francisca's vineyards, it has tight, ripe berry flavors and beautifully manicured tannins."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,St. Innocent,22.0,91.0,"About one-third was fermented in neutral oak, the rest in stainless steel, yielding a rich and smooth wine loaded with fresh flavors of pear and nectarine fruits. There's a tasty pie crust toastiness also, and the lingering finish has you reaching for the next sip."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Dupré,22.0,91.0,"A big, rich wine, this is bold with black fruits and some firm tannins. The concentration comes from vines planted in 1935, giving a great, dense texture. As it develops, the wine will become ripe, jammy, delicious and impressive. Drink from 2018."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Laurent Gauthier,22.0,91.0,"This rich, rounded and full wine offers great red fruits that are embedded in the dry, dense tannins. Still young, it has a mineral texture that needs to soften and fill out. It's a wine to age; drink from 2017."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo,22.0,91.0,"Underbrush, moist soil, menthol and woodland berry aromas unfold in the glass. The structured palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice and a hint of mocha alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Balthasar Ress,22.0,91.0,"A lovely expression of Rheingau's exquisite minerality, this dry Riesling pulsates tones of steel and stone. Green apple and fresh herb flavors are highlighted by racy streaks of lime and lemon. It's slight in frame, but finishes with precision and power."
White Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Coustarret,22.0,91.0,"Situated on 12 acres in the Pyrénées foothills, Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret could mimic their wine: still young and will age well. With a dominance of Petit Manseng in the blend, this is a lightly honeyed wine even if it is dry. Mangos and apricots are lifted by such fresh acidity and beautiful orange zest tanginess. Drink from 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Fritz Haag,22.0,91.0,"Cool, mineral elegance and pristine tangerine and quince flavors mark this zesty, sylphlike Riesling. It's dry and light bodied with a finish highlighted by lemony acidity. Drink now through 2019."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Amalie Robert,22.0,91.0,"All stainless-fermented and aged, this deserves to be on your short list of can't-miss choices in a domestic Chardonnay. Year after year it scores well, with fresh, vivid fruit, a crisp and inviting mouthfeel, lively spices and ripe tree fruits. There's a seam of wintergreen running alongside in this new vintage, leaving your mouth feeling scrubbed clean."
Weissburgunder,Germany,Rheinhessen,Wagner-Stempel,22.0,91.0,"Blossomy fresh with a bounty of crisp white peach and apricot flavor, this sprightly Weissburgunder, or Pinot Blanc, is the embodiment of spring. Lively and light-footed, it's an invigorating thirst quencher finishing on a zesty spray of lime and mineral."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ruby,22.0,91.0,"This is an outstanding value in a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir—soft, subtle and spicy, with sweet strawberry and cherry fruit. All neutral oak fermented, the mouthfeel is smooth and supple, and the flavors have a sexy, delicious quality that says “drink me now!”"
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,22.0,91.0,"Savory notes of chervil combine with fresh citrus and ripe pear on the nose. The plate still has a yeasty, leesy touch and a full texture on the generous but fresh body. Slight spritz adds to the verve. The finish is both warming and refreshing, and chock full of pear fruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château d'Agassac,22.0,91.0,"The second wine from this estate with its moated medieval castle is finely structured while showing all the delicious fruit of this vintage. It has spice, some firm tannins and juicy black-currant fruitiness. It will develop well and relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Hovey,22.0,91.0,"Almost black in color, the Hovey Petite is layered and concentrated, deep and soulful with flavors of lavender, berry and licorice segued by a coffee and tobacco kicker. A true Petite Sirah lovers' Petite Sirah."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Redhawk,22.0,91.0,"A superb value, this estate-grown Pinot brings dense fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry, sourced from Dijon clones. Firm and slightly high-toned, it spent 17 months in one-third new oak, resulting in baking-spice notes that unfold on the finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Marcel Lapierre,22.0,91.0,"Lapierre bottled two versions of this wine, one using no sulfur, one using some sulfur. It makes a fascinating contrast, but this version without sulfur is inevitably the better, not losing one iota of the ripe fruit, the rich cherries and immediately attractive bonbon and candy flavors."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Zaca Mesa,22.0,91.0,"For one of their lower-priced bottlings, this blend of 55% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault is a great deal. The nose shows exuberant black raspberry, scarlet rose petals and fresh lilacs against a backdrop of dewy thyme and oregano. That herbal component carries strongly to the palate, giving nuance to tangy plum fruits. The savory touch would pair with everything from pasta to Asian-spiced beef."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Müller-Grossmann,22.0,91.0,"Bergamot leaf and sea breezes are conjured up in this streamlined, sleek and ultradry Riesling. This is fresh but sunny, ripe but svelte. Just what you need on a hot summer day. The lip-smacking finish keeps you coming back for more."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Gradis'ciutta,22.0,91.0,"Round and juicy, this opens with aromas of stone fruit, dried herb and a whiff of pear. The ripe, enveloping palate doles out white peach, mature apple, juicy nectarine and a hint of bitter almond. A mineral note closes the lingering finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Matchbook,22.0,91.0,"This blend of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon incorporates wonderful, spicy oak with a ripe and generous core of black fruits to a firm texture of fine-grained tannins. It has plenty of oak character, but the oak is well integrated and complements the blackberry and blueberry flavors deftly."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Amalie Robert,22.0,91.0,"This is a lovely, unadorned Chardonnay: no oak, no malo, just great fruit. The beauty and power of the Dijon clones is on full display, with penetrating citrus and apple fruit buoyed by punchy acidity that carries through a long finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,22.0,91.0,"Juicy and dark with layers of boysenberry and blackberry fruit, with high tones of tar and brick, Cedarville's estate-grown Zin comes to life in decomposed granite soils, giving the wine a satisfying and sultry profile. Enjoy this Zin in good time (3–5 years) and pair with dark, smoky meats."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Mitolo,22.0,91.0,"This hearty Shiraz is no joke. The smoky, meaty nose blends right into bold fruit flavors of blueberries and mulberries. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a plush yet vibrant finish. Drink now–2020."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,22.0,91.0,"A riper touch of russet-pear peel joins the fresh lemon notes on the nose. On the palate, zesty concentration becomes evident. This is compact and has impact but retains a juicy, friendly core that makes you want to sip more. Lemon ripeness continues through the long, dry finish."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Zull,22.0,91.0,"Beautifully light, a steely core wrapped in apricot, citrus and the brightest, perfumed acidity. A delicious wine, packed with fresh, pure fruit character."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Awatere River,22.0,91.0,"Even tasted blind, this wine's Awatere origins shone through, bursting with fresh nettles and tomato leaf which garnish currant-like fruit. It's amply concentrated and round in the mouth, then long and mouthwatering on the finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Sainte Marguerite,22.0,91.0,"Rich, full-bodied wine with a serious nature. It impresses with its ripe red fruit, the layer of caramel well integrated with acidity. The feel is soft, but certainly dry, giving an impressive structured aftertaste."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Adelsheim,22.0,91.0,"A solid effort from a well-balanced vintage, this is whole-cluster pressed and largely fermented in stainless steel. A percentage went into neutral oak, and none went through malolactic. It's a clean, honest style, that confidently displays the fruit flavor of the grape—a juicy and refreshing mix of apples, white peaches, melon and spice."
Merlot,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,22.0,91.0,"A fine effort in this classic vintage, the Merlot is firm, almost muscular, and dappled with fresh herbs—cilantro and basil. The brambly blackberry fruit has the power to more than hold its own after 18 months in two-thirds new French oak."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Luna Beberide,22.0,91.0,"With pure black-fruit aromas, modest minerality and violet scents, the bouquet is right on target. In the mouth, this is saturated and wide, with smooth tannins. Earthy flavors of blackberry, licorice and baking spices finish solid and toasty. This fits the bill and then some; drink through 2018."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,R. de Ayala Lete E Hijos,22.0,91.0,"Having never tried this producer's wines, we can only heap praise on this medium-bodied, more modern style of Rioja. Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors. Firm and mildly tannic, with ample new oak leaving lasting flavors of vanilla, coffee and pepper. Hold for another year or so, if possible; 900 cases produced."
Merlot,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,22.0,91.0,"A strong contender for the best $22 Merlot in the country. Sculpted, dense and deeply layered, it's loaded with mixed blue and black fruits, fresh herb and sweet toast. The use of new oak is restrained and appropriate, extending the finish with nicely applied streaks of coffee around ripe, tight, dry tannins."
Riesling,US,Washington,O•S Winery,22.0,91.0,"Intense, spicy and loaded with grapefruit, pineapple and citrus, this has a unique intensity and power. If you distill Washington Riesling down to its essential fruit/sugar/acid components, this expresses it beautifully. At just 9.8% alcohol, it's a definite Kabinett style, with so much acid that the 2% sugar does not signify."
Riesling,US,California,MaidenStoen,22.0,91.0,"The delicate but intriguing nose on this wine from young but experienced vintner Michael Callahan shows dried honey, lemon blossoms, beach sand, yellow cake and a touch of coconut shavings. It's rich and waxy on the palate, with flavors of cooked Meyer lemon, yellow flowers and a petrol-driven grip."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Heitz,22.0,91.0,"Made from organically grown grapes, this wine opens in grass and grapefruit pith, crisply inviting one in. Lemon zest complements the refreshing juiciness while the finish has a bit of a bite, giving an edgy complexity."
Rosé,US,California,Malene Wines,22.0,91.0,"Light pink in color, this wine offers laser-sharp, zesty aromas, with pink limeade, pink grapefruit and crushed white-rock scents. There's lots of life to the palate, where a cement minerality unites ripe flavors of watermelon, tart nectarine, white peach and strawberry."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Mumm Napa,22.0,91.0,"An unusual blend of 48% Chardonnay, 43% Pinot Noir, 6% Pinot Gris and 3% Pinot Meunier, this is pale sunflower-yellow, with a thick mousse and well-developed layers of orange blossom, lemon and pear."
Red Blend,Lebanon,Bekaa Valley,Château Ksara,22.0,91.0,"Dark garnet in the glass, this blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Franc and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon offers aromas of wild raspberry, brambles and geranium leaf. It offers a good balance of tannins and acidity as well as fruit and spice flavors featuring blackberry, black cherry, chocolate, coffee, fennel bulb and black pepper. Mouth-coating tannins do not overpower, but continue well into the bright, lasting finish."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,David Hill,22.0,91.0,"This cool-climate wine offers relatively low alcohol and a delicate, mineral-driven structure. A light floral note opens into a complex, invigorating palate, mixing honeysuckle, beeswax, apple and wet stone. It comes from original, own-rooted, 1965 plantings according to the winery."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Ponzi,22.0,91.0,"Vinified in stainless steel, this affordable wine doesn't need new oak flavors to flesh it out. It's sharply defined, with crisp apple and pear fruit that carries a touch of spice. The length and precision are impressive."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Favray,22.0,91.0,"The wine is ripe, dense and with fine layers of green fruits, grapefruit and acidity. The flinty texture is still strong in this young wine which bursts with youthful fruitiness. It is going to develop well into an impressive wine. Drink from late 2018."
Rosé,US,California,Andrew Murray,22.0,91.0,"This very pale rosé from Syrah master Andrew Murray shows Pink Lady apple, cantaloupe and spun sugar scents on the nose. It's very fresh on the palate, with lively acidity that cuts through the riper cantaloupe and other melon flavors on the midpalate. Chalky texture raises it above many other rosés."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine de la Tour Blanche,22.0,91.0,"Enticing notes of ripe juicy yellow pear mix with tangy notes of fresh citrus zest on the nose. The fluid palate has the same interplay of ripe generosity—think yellow plum and ripe pear, and fresh lemony zestiness. This is off dry, full flavored and fresh."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Domaine Divio,22.0,91.0,"This is classy in every way, from the label to the aromatics to the mouthfeel to the elegant finish. It's a New World take on a Sancerre rouge: delicate and bone dry, yet substantial and utterly delicious. Citrus rind, persimmon, strawberry and a hint of chocolate combine, with a lingering graceful finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de Corbiac,22.0,91.0,"While it is structured and solid, the wine also has rich black fruits that are surrounded by the firm, dry tannins. There is a base of dark chocolate, wood spice and a brooding final quality to the weighty finish."
Vermentino,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Argiolas,22.0,91.0,"This full-bodied white opens with aromas of ripe yellow peach, Spanish broom, chamomile and Mediterranean brush. The round, creamy palate doles out juicy pineapple, baked yellow apple, saline, mineral and candied nectarine zest alongside soft acidity."
Merlot,US,Washington,Seven Hills,22.0,91.0,"This is a terrific Merlot, offering structure and balance (hallmarks of all Seven Hills wines) along with rich fruits, accented with earth and herb. There is lovely density and texture at work here, plenty of black cherry fruit, and a gentle hint of composted earth."
Cinsault,US,California,Onesta,22.0,91.0,"Leafy, fennel-like aromas top this fresh, grapy and well-balanced wine. It tastes lively and tangy but also brings good ripeness and richness to the palate. Made from vines as old as 130 years, it's a wonderful break from the ordinary."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Montes,22.0,91.0,"Classic Carmenère aromas of spiced blackberry, olive, herbs and cola hint at green, but in the mouth this warm-vintage wine is ripe, lush and layered, with resiny oak. Flavors of cola, vanilla, blackberry and black cherry are nicely herbal, while a spicy finish brings char and coffee notes along with plush weight. Drink through 2018."
Claret,US,California,Donati,22.0,91.0,"All five Bordeaux varieties are blended into this wine that offers boysenberries, violets, black pepper and sweet tar on the nose. The palate is decorated with a complex mix of blackberry, purple florals, dark chocolate and espresso bean, proving meaty and well spiced."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Cambiata,22.0,91.0,"Concentrated black plum and violet notes mesh with potting soil, cola and a candied black-raspberry character on the nose of this bottling. The palate combines boysenberry with woody elderberry fruit as well as a warmer red cherry and red-plum core, edged by pine needles, juniper and tart pomegranate complexity."
Rosé,US,Washington,Gård,22.0,91.0,"Packaged in a sexy, Champagne-style bottle, this 100% Grenache is firm and substantial. It underscores fruit flavors of peach, apricot and melon with appealing minerality."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Lucien Lardy,22.0,91.0,"Impressive and dense, this wine has a dark structure, firm tannins as well as fruit. Flavors of spice and smokiness are lifted by the red-berry flavors and acidity. The wine is still young, needing more time, so drink from 2016."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ebner-Ebenauer,22.0,91.0,"An initially funky hint on the nose soon turns into exotically spicy notions of lime zest and grapefruit foliage with riper notions of peach shimmering through. This dances on tiptoe, it speaks of ease and joy, is lively and refreshing with a lovely lemony finish."
Barbera,US,California,Monte Smith,22.0,91.0,"This is a handsome wine all the way, from the lightly spicy aromas through the layered fruit, chocolate and cinnamon flavors, to the moderately tannic and lingering finish. With its great balance and mouthwatering flavors, it will be a tasty addition to almost any meal."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,22.0,91.0,The nose reveals nothing but the slightest creaminess. The palate adds lovely greenish notes of lime and mandarin that pervade every last corner of the mouth with their insistent lively freshness. A lovely brisk little number that is sure to wow lovers of clean Riesling.
Austrian white blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Ingrid Groiss,22.0,91.0,"Although the nose is restrained, fresh, ripe notions of Mirabelle and yellow apple can be made out. The palate is bright and poised, shot through with lemon zestiness and lip-smacking freshness. Dry, toned and slender, it's packed with bright, citrusy fruit."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Sokol Blosser,22.0,91.0,"Record heat in the Dundee Hills in 2015 brings extra richness to this bone-dry rosé. Bright strawberry fruit flavors are set in a bed of racy acidity. It's as fresh and flavorful as a rosé can be, so enjoy it before 2016 draws to a close."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,22.0,91.0,"A blend of fruit from Schmitt, Evergreen and Oasis vineyards, this opens with appealing aromas of toast, candy corn, almond and pear. The pear and melon flavors are crisp and rounded, with a lightly creamy feel heightening the interest."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,Andrew Rich,22.0,91.0,"This new vintage is as pleasing as those in the past, with spicy flavors touching on pink grapefruit, orange rind and flesh, and just a hint of sweetness rounding off the bright acids. It's well-balanced and in a prime drinking window."
Grenache Blanc,US,Oregon,Quady North,22.0,91.0,"This bright, fresh and captivating white wine has crisp citrus (think Sauvignon Blanc) and peachy flesh (think Chardonnay). It goes still further, with an extra dollop of spice, extending the flavors well into a long clean crisp finish. All stainless steel fermented—what you taste is simply great fruit from an emerging vineyard."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Sightglass,22.0,91.0,"This wine was fermented and aged in stainless steel. The aromas bring pure notes of apple, Bosc pear and candle wax. The palate is clear and crisp, with a creamy feel and long finish. It impresses."
Red Blend,US,California,Los Padres,22.0,91.0,"Especially for a more affordable bottling, Joey Tensley packs in a ton of density on this bottling, from the color to the nose to the palate. Hearty aromas of black currant, charred blackberry, dusty sagebrush and a hint of caramel drop into a deep and rich but not overripe palate of tar and blackened fruit. Soft tannins coat the mouth fully."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Joseph Drouhin,22.0,91.0,"The wine is dense and structured. It has concentrated red-berry fruits that are backed up by firm tannins as well as acidity. The wine is ripe, still young and with its structure, it will be better from 2017. The charity Hospices of Belleville owns land as part of its foundation, with the wines being made by Beaune negociant Joseph Drouhin"
Grenache,US,California,Koehler,22.0,91.0,"Pale pink in color, this wine offers nice touches of bubblegum and watermelon, with lively white pepper for a complex twist. Clean and lovely lines of pink strawberry, rocky minerality and more of that intriguing pepper spice continue on the palate that leaves the mouth watering. It's a great pink."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,22.0,91.0,"Pure in character, this has a taut line of perfumed white fruits, with a nervy, tight character. It is young, needing several years of aging to bring out its complex flavors."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,22.0,91.0,"Fresh, herb and miso-tinged yeast for now is the chief flavor on this zesty, fresh and punchy yet slender little number. There is pepper and pear, but also soy and salt, with a lovely hint of both fizz and peach framed by super-zesty lemon freshness. You simply want to drink more."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Fourcas Hosten,22.0,91.0,"Now at its peak, this is a rich, full-bodied wine. It has a fine blend of dark tannins and dense plum and berry fruits. Maturing well, the wine is well balanced, with a smoky edge and still with a touch of acidity. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Mauvesin Barton,22.0,91.0,"This marks the first vintage of this Moulis estate under the ownership of the Barton family of Léoville Barton. Already the wine is showing breeding and an understated structure and richness. Lightly perfumed, full of black fruits and integrated tannins, it should age well. Drink from 2017."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Bágoa do Miño,22.0,91.0,"Crystal-clean, agile aromas of peach and melon are ideal. This wine feels elegant and just right, with flavors of sea brine, citrus and tropical fruits working in harmony. Peppy, acid-driven stone-fruit flavors carry a fine finish."
Tinto Fino,Spain,Northern Spain,Atalayas de Golbán,22.0,91.0,"Smooth heady aromas of black fruits touched up by oaky vanilla and tobacco are a draw. In the mouth, this is chunky and defined by thick abrasive tannins. Ripe blackberry, coffee and chocolate flavors finish with leftover oak that rests atop residual black-fruit flavors. Drink through 2022."
Zinfandel,US,California,Three,22.0,91.0,"Opulent and ripe, this full-bodied wine has great fruit concentration, a rich texture supported by firm tannins and a lingering, plummy finish. Oak plays a minimal role through all its blackberry and black plum flavors, but spicy clove and cedar accents emerge and persist through the finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Claiborne & Churchill,22.0,91.0,"This pioneering Alsatian-inspired winery always amazes with this distinctive and approachable bottling. Bright botanical aromas of mandarin orange rind, honeysuckle and pear give way to a zesty palate full of preserved citrus and marmalade flavors, all set against a firm structure and racy acidity. The finish—which is bone dry—opens with nectarine notes, then sails off with a flash of herbs."
Red Blend,Italy,Southern Italy,Alberto Longo,22.0,91.0,"Aromas suggest smoke, blue flower, mature berry and baking spice. A blend of 55% Nero di Troia, 30% Montepulciano d'Abruzzo and 15% Bombino Bianco, this has a savory, smoky palate that delivers juicy blackberry, spicy blueberry, clove and graphite alongside sleek tannins. It's delicious and already approachable."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Mitolo,22.0,91.0,"This bottling is less ebullient than previous vintages, but that only makes it more appealing. It still has its hallmark blackberry, spice and cocoa shadings, they're just in better overall proportion and balanced by more of an earthy, savory streak. The tannins are ripe and silky, the fruit bright on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,22.0,91.0,"A rich, smooth wine that wears its ripeness and opulence with grace. The structure is all there, a dry center that supports the blackberry jelly and sweet fruits, as well as acidity, a vivid freshness that acts as a foil to all the rich, meaty flavors."
Rosato,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Pietradolce,22.0,91.0,"Made with 100% Nerello Mascalese, this crisp savory rosato boasts aromas and flavors of red cherry, crushed strawberry, baking spice and juicy tangerine. A flinty mineral note lingers on the bright finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Casa da Torre,22.0,91.0,"Aged on its lees for 10 months after harvest, the wine has a rich character that also shows in the light gold color. There is a nutty toasty character to this wine that gives it extra complexity and richness. Drink this impressive wine now"
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,As Laxas,22.0,91.0,"Stony lime aromas are lightly floral and appealing. This feels smooth and slightly round despite showing firm acidity. Nectarine and melon flavors end with lasting minerality and a stone-fruit character. As per usual, As Laxas doesn't disappoint."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Priest Ranch,22.0,91.0,"Aged entirely in stainless steel, this slightly tropical, very pretty wine is inviting on the nose and palate. Pure, crisp and focused, it shows softly crafted layers of lemon and vanilla that provide a lushness on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef),22.0,91.0,"Whiffs of turmeric and saffron lend exotic flair to this bracing lemon-lime Riesling. Off-dry in style, it's refreshing and quaffable, yet remarkably complex if you'll give it the time and attention it deserves. Drink now through 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,22.0,91.0,"This Columbia Valley Syrah boasts strong varietal aromatics. It seems to have a spine of iron and a streak of garrigue-like dried herb, with lovely flavors of pomegranate and wild berry."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Perlage,22.0,91.0,"This stunning sparkler opens with lovely aromas of hawthorn, wisteria, white orchard fruit and herbs. The crisp, savory palate offers white peach, green apple, lemon zest and minerals while a creamy mousse softens the vibrant acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wine & Soul,22.0,91.0,"This comes from 30-year-old vines in the Quinta da Manoella, the family vineyard of Jorge Borges, one of the winemaking husband-and-wife team at Wine & Soul. This bottling shows the fruit-driven side of this vineyard, which also has 100-year-old vines. It's dense and solid, with powerful tannins that are beautifully integrated into the big plum fruits. The aftertaste is smooth, rich and concentrated."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Les Vignes des Prêcheurs,22.0,91.0,"Full-bodied for a rosé (as Tavel should be), this wine boasts plenty of cherry-berry fruit, but also appealing, complex notes of fresh thyme, ground clove and aniseed. Drink this blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Cinsault, 10% Syrah and 10% Clairette (a white grape variety) over the rest of 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,22.0,91.0,"Ripe and textured, this is a juicy, black-fruit-flavored wine. Power behind the fruit gives firmness and concentration. Acidity and berry fruits contrast with pepper and a bitter edge that needs to soften. Drink from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Tinel-Blondelet,22.0,91.0,"Tightly wrought and still young, this is a concentrated wine. It has great fruitiness that is tangy with a strong mineral texture from the silex soil. Green asparagus and lemon fruits are combined. Drink this complex wine from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Dão Sul,22.0,91.0,"Tannins give a dark, mineral structure. The black fruits, slowly coming through, are still part of this serious purpose, with wood flavors and dry fruits prominent. It still needs aging, so don't drink before 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Wines & Winemakers,22.0,91.0,"A rich wine that is made by the Abreu Callado charity foundation. It has dark black currant fruits, big tannins and an elegant feel.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,22.0,91.0,"This wine offers black cherry, chocolate and lavender aromas. It has a good mouthfeel, with blackberry, pomegranate, juniper and violet flavors set in a web of supple tannins that give way to dried Mediterranean herb notes on the finish."
White Blend,US,Washington,Kontos,22.0,91.0,"This is an unusual blend of Viognier, Chardonnay, Roussanne and Orange Muscat—quite different from previous vintages. Crisp and penetrating, it's a mix of lime, melon and kiwi flavors that are etched with skin phenolics, putting some delicious bite into the finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Dowsett Family,22.0,91.0,"From vines planted in 1982, this delivers exuberant lychee, spice, rose petal and citrus zest aromas. It's dry and medium-bodied on the palate, with spice-driven flavors and floral notes that persist on the (slightly warm) finish. It drinks well on its own but really sings at the dinner table."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Marietta Cellars,22.0,91.0,"A very dark color and densely packed aromas of blackberry, charred wood and dark chocolate are followed by a richly tannic texture and generous flavors that are dry and reminiscent of espresso beans and black cherries. The concentration of flavor and equally impressive tannic mouthfeel make this wine bold and memorable."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Apolloni,22.0,91.0,"This elegant wine appeals from the first sniff to the last lingering flavors. Vibrant in color, it tastes of rose petals, raspberries and cocoa powder. Supple and balanced, it shows impressive structure and length, with hints of citrus. Drink now through the mid-2020's."
Riesling,US,New York,Paumanok,22.0,91.0,"Juicy mango and yellow peach flavors are intensified by a mineral slick in this gorgeously textured wine. A jolt of lime on the midpalate gives edge to silky layers of fruit, exposing a lingering honeycomb finish. Complex yet light bodied and quaffable, it's a new benchmark for Long Island Riesling."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Jean-Paul Balland,22.0,91.0,"This is a tight, textured and fruity wine. With a great mineral texture and steely structure, it is a wine for some aging. Lemon and pink grapefruit flavors sheer through the texture, still waiting to balance. From 2017 it will be a fine wine."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Ehrhart,22.0,91.0,"Wonderfully pure notes of mandarin and tart apple on the nose are joined by richer hints of burnt sugar, candied orange and honey. These are shot through with arrows of clean, fresh and pure lemon acidity that highlight the richer, honeyed notes, and also make this wine finish dry. It's full of life and joy."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Bágoa do Miño,22.0,91.0,"Leesy aromas of pear, apple and vanilla are pure and generous, with intensity. Layered and elegant on the palate, this was made entirely from free-run juice and tastes of dry apricot, citrus and apple. A note of spicy white pepper rises up on a minerally finish. Drink this winning Albariño now."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Apolloni,22.0,91.0,"The winery notes that this was done in an ice wine style—cryogenically—and it was done very well indeed. Pretty aromas show concentrated lemon and honey highlights. Once tasted, they carry through with flavors of orange marmalade, maple syrup and brown sugar. Sweet but not cloying, it's a slice of lemon pie in a glass."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Sokol Blosser,22.0,91.0,"Production is only about one-tenth as much as the Willamette Valley cuvée. For a couple bucks more you get a tight, less opulently fruity wine, with compact skin flavors over-riding fruit flesh. Hints of apple, pear and peach accompany a streak of minerality, and the persistence suggests that this will age nicely. Drink 2020 through 2026."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Petaluma,22.0,91.0,"This is floral on the nose, offering up hints of talcum powder and restrained fruit. Yet the apple, cinnamon and lime flavors bust out on the palate before ending in a long, potent, citrusy finish. Drink now or hold up to 10 years."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,22.0,91.0,"From vineyards overlooking the city of Vienna, this is a field blend of old varieties. It is crisp and spicy with an exotic ginger note along with its fruitiness, and fresh acidity. It's not for aging but will improve over the next year. Screwcap."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Hager Matthias,22.0,91.0,"This is a serious, organically grown wine, that's big, ripe and spicy with a great creamy texture. Very full in the mouth, it boasts rich yellow fruits laced with a chalky, mineral character. Acidity plays a pivotal role in keeping all this freshness in balance. Drink after 2–3 years. Screwcap."
Rosé,US,California,Malene Wines,22.0,91.0,"There's a chalky power to the nose of this lightly hued wine, its baking soda aromas melding with rose petal, lime peel and watermelon scents. There's tremendous tension to the palate, where bubblegum and ambrosia melon flavors meet limestone-like minerality. Ripe enough to make it playful, it's bright enough to drink all day."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,22.0,91.0,"Equal parts Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc, this wine offers aromas of kiwi, spice and citrus that provide nuance and appeal. It's textured and full in feel, stretching out on the finish."
Gewürztraminer,Canada,British Columbia,St. Hubertus,22.0,91.0,"A splendid nose with rose petals, lychee and melon starts this off well, and it continues with expressive fruit and tongue-coating oiliness. It's clean and rich, dry and robust, and would be ideal with a moderately spicy Thai curry."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,22.0,91.0,"Friendly and animating notes of ripe Amalfi lemon, ripe pear and fresh greenery come together in this immensely appetizing white. Focused citric softness makes this a serious pleasure to drink. The peppery aftertaste lingers dangerously long."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,22.0,91.0,"Richly satisfying this offers powerful tannins and equally powerful, juicy fruits. It has a great sense of structure, density and potential. Ripe berry and black plum fruits push through the impressive tannins to produce a wine that is developing well, although it will need several more years. Drink from 2018."
Rosé,US,California,Holly's Hill,22.0,91.0,"This dry, lithe and almost athletic Rhône-style wine made from 55% Grenache Noir and 45% Cinsault shows a different approach to rosé from the candy-sweet versions. It's a perfect pour for lunch or a pre-dinner drink and has the acidity and body to pair with cedar planked salmon or even beef tri-tip. It's that good."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Cicchitti,22.0,91.0,"Cola and berry aromas start out rocky but become earthier and richer with time. This is chubby and ripe, with a hardy level of extraction. Blackberry, mocha and coffee flavors finish with a note of chocolate, and with tons of fruit and proper balance, this is easy to like."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Caves Aliança,22.0,91.0,"From the eastern vineyards of the Douro, in Douro Superior, this estate wine is heavily structured while showing rich fruit and impressive tannins. The texture is strongly mineral, complex and hinting at the concentration from fruit grown in this hot, dry climate. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Fiddlehead Cellars,22.0,91.0,"A remarkable shade of slightly purple bubblegum, Kathy Joseph's wine shows strawberries and buttery croissants on the nose. The flavors are boisterous and nearly effervescent, with berries, yeast and a long-lasting sense of strawberry mousse. This one goes down all too easy."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,22.0,91.0,"Yeast, lovage and yellow pear unite in an ultrasavory Grüner that honors the variety's nickname of pfefferl—the peppery one. The flavor base rests on green pear and fresh lemon, but the spice ratchets everything up a notch, and the lovely pepper lingers. Incredibly appetizing, this wine calls for light, savory dishes."
Rhône-style Red Blend,Australia,South Australia,Torbreck,22.0,91.0,"A terrific value, this blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Mataro and 20% Shiraz features a forward bouquet of slightly jammy mixed berries. The palate showcases vibrant red fruit on a supple bed of tannins, capped off by a savory, tapanade-laden finish that makes it more than a simple fruit bomb. Very silky and drinkable, it's the ultimate wine-bar wine, as the name suggests."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,L'Ptit Paysan,22.0,91.0,"Ian Brand's fun and wallet-friendly blend of 53% Grenache, 28% Syrah and 19% Mourvèdre offers an interesting nose of charred beef, anise, beets, red rose petals, hints of purple fruit and a judicious touch of asphalt. The dark flavors of black licorice, black pepper, pencil lead and dried violets surround a boysenberry core, but remain light on the palate."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Mayne Vieil,22.0,91.0,"While this wine is concentrated with firm tannins, the rich fruit dominates. It is dark, complex and rich, filled with black-plum flavors and a good structure. Intense juiciness character complements the tannins, giving a ripe wine that can age. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Gris,US,California,J Vineyards & Winery,22.0,91.0,"Always a popular offering from this winery, this crisp, fruity white is round and robust on entry. It harmoniously combines juicy acidity with flavorful waves of peach, lime and guava, while the finish is laced with nutmeg."
Red Blend,US,California,Record Family Wines,22.0,91.0,"This very quaffable blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Syrah and 12% Grenache hails from a property in northeast Paso. Juicy strawberry, black plum and cherry meet with wet soil and chopped mint on the nose. These make for a fresh landing on the palate as well, where red berries mesh with anise and sweet clove notes. Soft tannins and bright acid hold it together."
Viognier,US,California,Stolpman,22.0,91.0,"Beeswax, lemon-laced sour cream and a peach-blossom ripeness combine on the nose of this excellently restrained wine from a highly variable, often overripe grape. There is great energy and balance on the palate, with a light nuttiness and a touch of honey that will drink well for a few years."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Trimbach,22.0,91.0,"While this has a tight corset of freshness and structure, expressive notes of peach show their exuberance. The palate again reveals tautness, shot through with lemon purity while the peach delightfully plays around them."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Presqu'ile,22.0,91.0,"The unique nose of this wine shows crystalline lime candy and nectarine flesh, along with a sharper yet plush tangerine blossom aroma. The palate plays the cut-grass note with pride, offering bell pepper, jalapeño, green peppercorn and kaffir lime flavors, sewn together with a tightly wound acidity."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Savage Grace,22.0,91.0,"This is a completely unique wine for the state, one that calls out more to the Loire Valley than to Rattlesnake Hills. Coming in at a cool 12.5% alcohol—in a vintage known for average temperatures—it brings detailed notes of flowers, cigar box, raspberry and moist earth. With nine months of neutral French-oak aging, there's barely a trace of oak influence. It's lighter in style but still brings good depth with a long, flavorful finish. As far from a cocktail wine as you can get; serve this one at the dinner table."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,René Muré,22.0,91.0,"Perfumed, subtle apple notes unfold on the creamy, biscuity palate. This is rounded but fresh, generous but shows tension. A central seam of acidity keeps the dry palate very supple and lets the purity of this wine speak clearly. The mousse is somewhere between creamy and frothy and thus very invigorating. Bright fresh notes of greengage and lemon play on the nose. The palate has the same zippy fruit flavors which are ripe but remain resolutely fresh. The mousse is frothy and lively, accentuating the lemony brightness even more against a more mellow autolytic background. A wonderfully balanced dry fresh apéritif."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,González Byass,22.0,91.0,"Raisin and fig aromas are good but not overly complex or special. This P. X. feels rich, chewy and a touch sticky, with sweet-as-sin fig, chocolate and cinnamon spice flavors that suggest coffee cake with a drizzle of melted fudge. Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Granbazán,21.0,91.0,"Dry, dusty, elegant peach and minerally notes open this excellent Albariño. The lightest bit of spritz gives edge and zest to a medium-full palate. Flavors of stone fruits, wild herbs, field greens and white pepper finish healthy, with a melony aftertaste."
Syrah,US,California,Lynch Wines,21.0,91.0,"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels. The oak influence is well integrated with ripe fruit, firm tannins, good concentration and medium-full body. They add up to an enticing, complex and delicious wine that is very lively, a bit lean, and will age through at least 2019."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,DaMa,21.0,91.0,"The 2011 and 2012 Chardonnays from DaMa are a study in contrasts, showing how very different the vintages were. Both come from Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes, but in 2012 the wine has more floral highlights, and a vertical crispness to its structure. Flavors of anise, green apple and pear are wound up in the tight frame, and this would appear to have some years of life ahead."
Riesling,Australia,Victoria,Mount Langi Ghiran,21.0,91.0,"Although this winery is better known for its Shiraz, I have been a consistent fan of its Riesling as well. The 2006 offers scents of powdered minerals and lime followed by flavors of apple and citrus. It's medium-bodied but muscular, with plenty of intensity that comes through on the long finish. Drink now–2016."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Torres,21.0,91.0,"Earthy berry, spice, leather and vanilla aromas are textbook for the region. This Crianza feels fresh but sturdy, with meaty tannins. Briar, cherry and medicinal plum and berry flavors finish with sweeping chocolate and brambly spice notes."
Zinfandel,US,California,Collier Falls,21.0,91.0,"Well-made, with clean, bright fruit and lots of pretty new oak. The wine is beautifully balanced, elegant with a long, rich, toasty finish. Fairly light fruit in this vintage, but well handled and perfectly showcased."
Zinfandel,US,California,Peterson,21.0,91.0,"Firm, ripe and fruity, with a nice mix of plums, berries and earth. The mountain fruit shows good acids, some mineral elements, and a long, complex finish with a fair amount of earth and barnyard. A distinctive, earthy style."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Rame,21.0,91.0,"This is a ripe, smoky wine with fine tannins and rich black fruit. Dense with black chocolate and damson flavors, it gives concentration and richness and will age well. Drink from 2020."
Rosé,France,Provence,Les Vignobles Gueissard,21.0,91.0,"With 45% Mourvèdre and 35% Cinsault this has turned into a highly flavored and aromatic wine. It has great fruits and a rich texture that has a herbal edge. It is certainly a food rosé and with its up-front fruit, it could do with a few months to calm down. Drink from late 2017."
Syrah-Mourvèdre,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Gérard Bertrand,21.0,91.0,"You won't be disappointed with this attractively priced Saint-Chinian. Floral and herbal, with strong scents of lavender, licorice, laurel and menthol all infusing the black cherry, currant and boysenberry center. Rich and concentrated with a tecture like crushed velvet and fine but well-structured tannins. Hints of black pepper and bittersweet chocolate grace the close."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Carnuntum,Markowitsch,21.0,91.0,"Ripe pear fruit comes with a spicy, peppery edge that blends creamy aloe vera with zesty grapefruit peel freshness. So easy and pleasant to drink and yet not without sophistication."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Türk,21.0,91.0,"Wonderfully zesty notes of lime peel are joined by savory hints of fern and riper notes of juicy, yellow pear. The palate is slender but expressive and adds more green pear notes alongside a lemony, easy freshness. This is concentrated and convincing."
Rosé,US,California,Margerum,21.0,91.0,"Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Coppo,21.0,91.0,"This wine's ripe, dark-skinned fruit, culinary spice and new leather scents lead the way, along with a menthol note. The firmly structured, chewy palate offers dried Morello cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and espresso flavors alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Groth,21.0,91.0,"Complemented by 9% Sémillon, this concentrated, creamy young wine is generous in pear, peach and subtle pineapple. Tart, it remains fresh and focused in the glass, with a lushness that's memorable and compelling. An impactful finish wraps things up nicely."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,21.0,91.0,"This racy and leesy young wine offers fresh and crisp flavors of cucumber, celery, jicama and green apple. Despite all the green components, it is not herbal or vegetal, and offers a precise, delicately crafted and ageworthy take on the grape."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Wise,21.0,91.0,"From Margaret River in Western Australia, this is a full-bodied, impressively endowed Shiraz at a reasonable price. Superripe aromas of blackberries and licorice mark the nose, while the palate features similar flavors, supple tanins and a creamy-textured finish. Good to go now, with enough concentration to hold until 2015."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine des Valanges,21.0,91.0,"Attractively spicy as well as fruity, this is a ginger and apricot-flavored wine. Great acidity balances the warm fruitiness. Full in the mouth while also crisp, the wine is ready to drink."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,21.0,91.0,"Full-fruited peachiness is tempered by tangy lemon acidity with texture and concentration. It's fruity and refreshing, but also very precise and delicious."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Cognettes,21.0,91.0,"This is really mature Muscadet, yet it's certainly not too old. It is toasty, with almond, spice and vanilla flavors plus the concentration that comes from old vines. It is a fascinating wine, ripe and with considerable depths. The wine is, of course, ready to drink."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Amavi,21.0,91.0,"Crystal clear, clean and fresh, this lovely wine mixes ripe citrus, tangerine and melon fruits, with a touch of barrel toast. It's full-bodied and rich without being thick or tiring in any way; simply delicious."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Olsen Estates,21.0,91.0,"The fruit is forward and lush, the grapes nicely blended and complementary, yielding a complex, mouthfilling wine with a riot of tropical, stone and citrus fruit flavors. There is a trace of new oak and a lingering finish that brings in vanilla, butter and coconut."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Owen Roe,21.0,91.0,"This wine shows finesse, driven by its seamless mix of citrus, melon, peach and pear fruits. Immediately delicious, it actually improves by the second day, showing its perfect acid-to-fruit balance. Give it a light chill—not too much—and it's a perfect autumnal sipper."
Rosé,Australia,South Australia,Hentley Farm,21.0,91.0,"This bright pink-ruby rosé features attractive aromas of watermelon rind and cherries. It's medium in body, fresh and vibrant on the palate, bursting with crunchy fresh fruit reminiscent of raspberries and cherries. Drink now."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Alvear,21.0,91.0,"Classic aromas of cinnamon, raisin, prune and spice rise from the glass, while flavors of pure caramel, baked apple, chocolate and cinnamon take over. This is thick stuff, but with game acidity it stops short of being syrupy. And it's forever long on the finish. Sweet, rich and balanced. What P.X. ought to be."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château du Coing de Saint-Fiacre,21.0,91.0,"Low yields, old vines and 2 years' lees aging are the basis of this concentrated wine. It is rich, full, very intense, but doesn't lose sight of strong minerality. Certainly a wine for aging, this is only just beginning its ripe development."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Hentley Farm,21.0,91.0,"Like 2005, 2015 looks to be an outstanding vintage for South Australia Riesling. This one, from two high-altitude vineyards, boasts incredible acid tension to go along with its relatively light body. Lemon and lime notes mingle with wet stone, finishing long and with great intensity. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,US,California,Lava Cap,21.0,91.0,"A decadent, dark and meaty Syrah, with plenty of sauvage tendencies amid a rich, velvety texture that finishes long and lushly perfumed with sweet smoke. In a cool year in El Dorado, Lava Cap has reined in this Syrah's tannins and let its dark cherry and plum flavors take center stage."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Fox Creek,21.0,91.0,"Full bodied, creamy and supple, this wine offers textbook aromas of cedar, tobacco and cassis. It brightens slightly on the palate, where cherry notes join the fun, then finishes long and softly dusty. Drink now–2028."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Malat,21.0,91.0,A closed nose hints nonetheless at some concentration. The palate reveals yellow plum held tight by citrus freshness. This is whistle-clean and holds charming nuances of grapefruit and peach. Drink now or wait until 2016–2017; more fruit may come to the fore.
Riesling,New Zealand,Marlborough,Spy Valley,21.0,91.0,"This is a medium-dry Riesling with plenty of weight and richness, but also wonderfully perfumed aromatics of citrus blossom. Lime and green apple fruit carries the palate, and finishes long, with an almost tactile sense of minerality."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Margerum,21.0,91.0,"Doug Margerum blends fruit from the McGinely, Curtin, Star Lane, Happy Canyon and Grassini vineyards for this ever-popular bottling. Aromas of honeysuckle, green pears and ceanothus blossoms introduce a palate laden with white flowers, poached pears and white peach."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trivento,21.0,91.0,"The nose is deep and dense, delivering pure blackberry and blueberry aromas along with toast and herb notes. It feels balanced and pure as a cloudless night, with controlled blackberry, spice and chocolate flavors. Strong on the finish, with bitter notes of chocolate and espresso, and narrow tannins."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Capezzana,21.0,91.0,"In 1998 Capezzana eliminated its “reserve” wine, thereby bumping up the quality of its DOC Carmignano by leaps and bounds. And the '99 is something to behold. Rich, extracted and jammy it is, with nuances throughout of crème de cassis, coffee, maple and most of all, chocolate. With a finish that coats every corner of your mouth, this Sangiovese (with 20% Cabernet) scores big."
Monastrell,US,California,Bokisch,21.0,91.0,"Also known as Mourvèdre. This Spanish-inspired Monastrell from Bokisch, grown on a hillside, is brawny with plenty of earth and bacon bite to it, yet also floral, rich yet also bright, tasting of black cherry and pomegranate with a menthol tobacco chaser."
Tempranillo,US,California,Bokisch,21.0,91.0,"Bright and earthy, dense and dark, this New World Tempranillo has an Old World soul, with dark cherry and strawberry going on as well as a touch of cocoa and tobacco. Its acidity adds a spark on the finish; this Ribera del Douro native grape seems plenty happy in the middle of California, at least in Bokisch's hands."
Red Blend,US,California,MCV,21.0,91.0,"Vintner Matt Villard blends Petite Sirah, Syrah, Grenache, Tannat and Petit Verdot into this whopper of a wine, which is very fairly priced. Aromas of vanilla-laden black cherries, hot fudge and licorice lace into an elegant, well-integrated nose. Once sipped, flavors of smoked blackberries, black rocks, purple flowers and more licorice linger long on the palate."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Heinrich,21.0,91.0,"Very dark, iron-oxide-tinged fruit lures you in. There also is a lot of pepper on the nose. The palate is full of dark crushed fruit: juicy blackberry, aromatic blueberry and red cherry. The tannins are supple and there is lovely freshness to the palate. This is vibrant, juicy, smooth and aromatic. Drink now–2022."
Shiraz-Viognier,Australia,Victoria,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier,21.0,91.0,"This joint-venture has been turning out consistently charming, balanced Shiraz over the past few vintages. The 2007 is simultaneously peppery-spicy, floral-perfumed and meaty-savory. It's medium-bodied, with a lovely plump softness to its mouthfeel, yet not without spine. Drink it over the next 5-8 years."
Silvaner,Germany,Franken,Castell,21.0,91.0,"Earthy touches of honeycomb and crushed stone lend minerality to this invigorating dry Silvaner. The palate is sprightly, boasting zesty squirts of fresh lime and green melon flavors. Brisk acidity and a pleasant tinge of lime pith mark the finish."
Monastrell,US,California,Bokisch,21.0,91.0,"Bokisch's 100% Monastrell is brooding with dark fruit—black cherries, currants and blackberries. It shows a cinnamon-swirled earth note and a layer of herb, with medium body. As such, it would be a beautiful wine with roasted meats like lamb or chicken that are swaddled in herbs or anise. The tannins are soft but structured enough to age."
Syrah,US,Washington,Two Vintners,21.0,91.0,"This wine is a blend of top sites Stoney Vine, Discovery, Olsen, StoneTree and Klipsun vineyards. Perfumed aromas of wet stone, earth, black olive and coffee lead to plush-feeling fruit and earth flavors that show persistence."
Cinsault,US,California,Phoenix Ranch,21.0,91.0,"This 100% old-vine Cinsault preserves the vineyard's earthiness in a unique wine aged in neutral French oak. It's light and bright, tasting of savory rhubarb, with soft layers of spice and a lingering, easy finish."
Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,21.0,91.0,"Rich and aromatic notes of fresh and baked red apples perfume nose and palate. They appear with equal expression on the juicy, soft but defined palate. This is full fruited and textured, ringing with soy spice and lemony freshness. The savoriness of the midpalate echoes long after the last drop."
Rosé,US,California,Sidebar,21.0,91.0,"Made entirely from Syrah grown on two vineyard sites, then fermented and aged in stainless steel, this wine is light pink-orange in color and begins with a robust flavor of hazelnut and savory lemon peel. Dry and crisp, it remains lighthearted in the glass, finishing with a tease of grapefruit."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,21.0,91.0,"This benchmark rosé is round yet fresh, and crisp while ripely fruity. Red berry fruits are finely textured and attractive acidity cuts through the full body of the wine. It would be worth aging until late 2014."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château du Châtelard,21.0,91.0,"This is a big, concentrated wine, impressive for 2007. There are solid tannins, with additional great acidity, and plenty of structure and ripeness. Red plums give a finishing lift."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,R&A; Pfaffl,21.0,91.0,"Ripe notes of yellow plum dance on the palate against a firm, citric background of immense freshness. This stands with poise and a seriously straight back. The midpalate is as savoury as soy sauce. Totally enlivening and refreshing with a lovely, concentrated core and backbone."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Fongaban,21.0,91.0,"The wine is ripe and packed with fruity Merlot. It has a dense structure and an opulent character that gives the wine considerable richness. The firm tannins are cushioned by all this fruit. It does have high alcohol, but the final acidity ensures that the wine remains crisp."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,21.0,91.0,"Sappy and deep, this brings a mouth-pleasing mix of citrus and stone fruits, broadening into a full midpalate. Full-bodied, it puts the emphasis on fruit, with just a trace of minerality."
Sauvignon Blanc,South Africa,Franschhoek,Chamonix,21.0,91.0,"A vibrant nose of grapefruit and flowers leads on this complex but lively Sauvignon from lauded winemaker Gottfried Mocke. On the palate, the oak-aged wine offers crispness and more tropical fruit and citrus, with a touch of minerality and spice on the finish. An excellent, elegant wine that can handle both typical SB dishes (seafood, salads) as well as heartier fare."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Angove,21.0,91.0,"This is full bodied and creamy textured, but still retains a sense of vibrancy and freshness. Black pepper notes help in that regard, spicing up the flavors of plum, mocha and roasted meat. It's plush, rich and long on the finish. Drink now–2025."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Margerum,21.0,91.0,"Very light in color, this wine has a brisk nose that shows Key lime peel, lemongrass, grapefruit blossom and a wet-concrete minerality. There is tremendous energy and zest on the palate, which is steely and stony with flavors of red grapefruit and a great textural grip."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Odfjell,21.0,91.0,"Deep black-fruit aromas are saturated and poised. On the palate, this is a bit jammy and pulpy but it delivers. Extracted flavors of blackberry, coffee and blackened oak finish with depth and lushness. Drink through 2020."
Malbec,Chile,Lontué Valley,Odfjell,21.0,91.0,"Dark jammy aromas of herbal blackberry and coffee are heady. In the mouth, this is full and fleshy. Lightly stewed blackberry, black currant and peppercorn flavors finish savory, herbal, blackened and oaky. Drink through 2021."
Merlot,US,Washington,Gordon Estate,21.0,91.0,"This round, rich and spicy estate-grown Merlot greets you with all the right stuff (and stuffing) from the first sniff. Clean berry and cherry fruit, with a light touch of peppery herb, rolls into silky tannins and pretty baking spices. A fine value."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Two Mountain,21.0,91.0,"A standout in a flight of pricier Chardonnays, this young wine is tight and focused, with a pretty toasty edge. Fresh apple and white peach flavors have taken on a lot of new oak, but have the stuffing to absorb it, especially with a bit more bottle age. A lot of vanilla, custard and almond-cookie goodness fills out the finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Chateau de l'Oiselinière,21.0,91.0,"As it ages, Muscadet becomes more like Chardonnay. Here, the wine has developed ripe tropical fruit notes and a smooth, creamy texture. The seven years of age has softened the fruit and acidity, leaving a rich wine that is deliciously ready to drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Margerum,21.0,91.0,"Plush and bright passionfruit aromas waft from this bottling drawn from five different vineyards, yet they are linked to sharper grass, lime rind and yellow grapefruit-pith tartness. Extreme energy shows on the sizzling palate, where Key lime, lemongrass and lemon peels conspire for a light-but-sharp experience."
Syrah,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,Casas del Toqui,21.0,91.0,"Bright cherry and berry aromas benefit from nicely integrated oak. This cool-vintage wine is slightly pulpy but not heavy on the palate. Plum and currant flavors end with notes of peppery spice, toasty char and lasting berry fruit. Drink through 2020."
Syrah,US,Washington,Two Vintners,21.0,91.0,"Coming from five different Syrah vineyards across the Columbia Valley, this wine offers high quality and value. It conveys black olives, iron, an earthy funk, chocolate and floral accents. The coffee and earth flavors are rich while still showing exquisite restraint."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Owen Roe,21.0,91.0,"This deservedly popular value bottle gets the star Pinot treatment—nine months in French oak, 27% new. It's spicy and full-flavored, with resonant blue plum fruit, buttery toast and a tannic frame."
Pinot Nero,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,21.0,91.0,"This 100% Pinot Nero offers enticing aromas of fragrant blue flower, wild red berry and a whiff of baking spice. The sleek savory palate delivers raspberry, green tea, graphite and a white pepper note. Fresh acidity and firm but refined tannins provide balance. Enjoy soon."
Red Blend,US,California,MCV,21.0,91.0,"This is a very big and jammy wine, but it's made with expert structure and elegance as well as affordability. Concentrated blackberry, black-currant, smoked beef and lavender aromas arise from the dark juice in the glass. The crème de cassis richness at the tip of the sip dries up into tight tannins and touches of fennel and thyme."
Red Blend,Spain,Spanish Islands,Suertes del Marqués,21.0,91.0,"This blend of Tintilla and Listán Negro opens with savory aromas of latex, plum and cherry dusted with minerals. The palate is full but racy. Flavors of plum and cranberry show spice and mineral notes before a long, peppery finish. Overall, this is bright, floral and interesting. Drink now."
Pinot Nero,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,21.0,91.0,"Bright aromas of crushed strawberry, rose petal and alpine herb waft out of the glass. On the refined, savory palate, green tea, graphite and a mineral note add depth to the red-berry core. Balanced with fresh acidity and supple tannins, this wine is all about sheer elegance and enjoyment."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac,21.0,91.0,"The blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Merlot is produced in the vineyard around this 12th-century castle. This is an impressive wine with its balanced structure and dark tannins. Concentrated and powered by its black plum fruits and acidity, it will age. Drink from 2020."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carol Shelton,21.0,91.0,"Hailing from vines planted in 1918 when the Los Angeles area was the state's top vineyard zone, this bottling shows elegant blackberry meringue, lavender chiffon and hedonistic fudge on the nose. Purple flowers also show on the palate, as do Earl Grey tea, plum rinds and black-pepper notes."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Volpaia,21.0,91.0,"A delicious expression of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with enticing aromas of fragrant purple flower, ripe red berry and sweet baking spice. The silky, vibrant palate doles out juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, clove and licorice while sleek tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. A tobacco note signals the close. Drink through 2018."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Mommessin,21.0,91.0,"From the most northern of the Beaujolais cru villages, this wine is rich and dense. It has a firm structure as well as black-currant fruits that bring out acidity as well as richness. There is a fine juicy aftertaste that is balanced with the final concentration."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Loncomilla Valley,G7,20.0,91.0,"Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy. Complex, balsamic flavors of olives, herbs, dried berries, turned earth and cocoa finish dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Woodinville Wine Cellars,20.0,91.0,"Aromas of dark chocolate, dried and fresh herbs, raspberries and black cherry predominate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Creamy, rich and focused, it has a pleasing sense of texture and vanilla flavors that carry across the finish. It's truly a standout wine at this price."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,20.0,91.0,"This rich and impressive wine has structure and a firm texture, partly from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend (45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon). It is dense and full of juicy red fruits, caramel and delicious spice. Production is only 2,500 cases. It would be worth aging for a few more months, so drink from late 2015."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine de la Bastide Blanche,20.0,91.0,"Very fruity and fresh, this wine has crisp apples as well as red fruit giving it a bright, delicious feeling. The acidity goes right through the wine, giving a beautifully fresh feel that points up the fragrant raspberries. Vineyards are in the heart of the sandy soils of the Saint Tropez peninsula."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine du Grand Cros,20.0,91.0,"Rounded and soft, this rich rosé is fruity while also perfumed. The blending of Syrah in the mix gives the wine a sense of power and concentration, making it an adquate partner at the dinner table."
Riesling,US,Idaho,Koenig Vineyards,20.0,91.0,"This is a über aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Penley Estate,20.0,91.0,"Mouthfilling and round, this wine's savory notes of roasted meat, mocha and cracked pepper frame plummy fruit. Vanilla creeps in on the long, supple finish. Drink now through 2025."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,20.0,91.0,"Whiffs of candlestick and honeycomb lend subtlety to zesty white-grapefruit and honeydew flavors in this dry Riesling. While rich, round and supple in mouthfeel, it's balanced squarely by acidity and a pleasant bite of lemon zest."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Collovray et Terrier,20.0,91.0,"A wine that is broad, feeling full-bodied, with weight, pear and quince fruit flavors. The wine is attractively plump, toast and acidity adding richness. It opens slowly to give a rich aftertaste."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Michael David,20.0,91.0,"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture. It needs full-flavored, rich food to accompany it, and will deliver a lot of pleasure under those circumstances. Best to drink now through 2020."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Navarro,20.0,91.0,"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Palacio,20.0,91.0,"This Crianza is strapping on the nose, with fairly big but not overdone black-fruit aromas. A ripe, chewy palate with moderate tannins holds peppery wild berry flavors that settle on plum. A dark, toasty, peppery finish is mild and smooth. Overall, this offers a lot to like."
Merlot,US,Virginia,Lovingston,20.0,91.0,"This is a well-done effort from winemaker Riaan Rossouw, which shows how engaging, inviting and refined Merlot can be. Spiced red plum and red currant aromas seductively waft over dried fern and Mediterranean herb tones. Silky, soft tannins provide just enough structure to uphold the curvacious body of ripe red plum, sweet baking spice and additional dried herbs. Amazingly, this plush wine maintains excellent acidic verve, which carries along the entire medley of flavors to a persistent fruit-laden finish. Drink now for utter enjoyment."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Magnum Vinhos,20.0,91.0,"Made from one of the great white grapes of Portugal (perhaps in the world), this rich wine, with its floral character, ripe yellow fruits and touches of wood and toast, is impressive and opulent. It has intense fruit flavors and light acidity to give them freshness. The wine is still young now, so enjoy from 2017."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Pfalz,Friedrich Becker,20.0,91.0,"Hints of smoke, cinnamon and vanilla lend added depth to this deeply brambly, berried Pinot Noir. It's rich and round on the palate, yet balanced foursquare by a strike of cranberry acidity and soft, feathery tannins. The finish is long and persistent."
Torbato,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Sella & Mosca,20.0,91.0,"Vibrant and elegant, this refreshing, mineral-driven white offers aromas of white spring flower, ripe orchard fruit and citrus blossom. Bright acidity frames the juicy pear, apple and flint flavors, while the crisp finish closes on a saline note. This is a fantastic wine from a grape grown only at the Sella & Mosca estate in Sardinia."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,20.0,91.0,"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering. The finish carries a suggestion of chalk, more in the sense of minerality than any artificial dryness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Beaumont,20.0,91.0,"An impressive wine, it already shows signs of its potential. It is elegant, with ripe fruits and layers of dark tannins. As it opens, blackberry fruits come through strongly, balancing the firm structure. Drink from 2018."
Rosé,US,Washington,Efeste,20.0,91.0,"Mostly Syrah, with some Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a succulent rosé with a marvelous mouthfeel. Texture and length are its main charms, with nuanced notes of rose petal, hibiscus, watermelon and pie cherry. The vineyard sources are Klipsun, Boushey and Ciel du Cheval."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,20.0,91.0,"A great vintage for the Sundance Red, this is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 14% Syrah. The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits. The 30% new oak is not only lavish for a $20 wine, but it judiciously complements all of the good fruit."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bucher,20.0,91.0,"This is just a gorgeous wine, so easy to enjoy, juicy in watermelon, grapefruit and dark, baked strawberry tart, a taste of summer evoked from every sip. Textured and complex, it gives a squeeze of blood orange that lingers and remains fresh through the finish. It's from the owner's estate vineyard, sought after by many other producers and made by Siduri's Adam Lee."
Syrah,Chile,Aconcagua Valley,Errazuriz,20.0,91.0,"Berry aromas are a touch dusty and floral on the nose, with hints of earth and cedar. On the palate, this wine is bright and balanced, with fresh acidity. Rich berry, cassis and spice flavors finish agile and long. Drink through 2016."
Red Blend,Lebanon,Lebanon,Ixsir,20.0,91.0,"Deep ruby in color, with aromas of black cherry, chocolate and sage, this blend has enticing flavors of blackberry, cherry, salted caramel and menthol. Fruit and savory tones are well integrated alongside smooth tannins, and the bright finish shows a lasting note of menthol. Fine Terroir Selections, Misa Imports."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,J. Portugal Ramos,20.0,91.0,"From a blend of grapes that includes Touriga Nacional, this wine is serious and dense. It has a solid texture along with concentrated dark-plum flavors. It's a powerhouse of firm tannins, juicy fruits and a fine layer of spice from wood aging. Drink after 2015."
Carmenère,Chile,Maule Valley,Odfjell,20.0,91.0,"Balsam, lush prune and all sorts of earthy, interesting aromas set this rich, ripe Carmenère off on a wild ride. Chocolate greets you at the front door, with deep plum and berry waiting behind. It's saturated and superripe but it doesn't lose step or steam. Excellent in the ultraripe, modern style."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,20.0,91.0,"Big, rich and fruity, this wine has a powerful future. It delivers structure and dense tannins, but it's the generous fruitiness that promises much. The tannins will soften by 2016–2017 to give a ripe, full-bodied wine, packed with fruit."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Gradis'ciutta,20.0,91.0,"Here's a polished Pinot Grigio with character. It's loaded with creamy green apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine sensations accented with spicy notes of cinnamon and ginger that add depth. Crisp acidity generates freshness and it has a lingering finish."
Zierfandler-Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Gebeshuber,20.0,91.0,"Lifted purity of ripe Williams pear and a streamlined but not unsubstantial body combine to make a compelling, abundantly pear-fruited wine. It manages to be slender, rich and mineral at the same time."
Merlot,US,California,Rancho Sisquoc,20.0,91.0,"Sweet cedar aromas kick off this attention-grabbing bottling, with elderberry and black plum scents combining for an Old World feel in which the structure can be sensed on sniff alone. Wood and graphite notes pop on the palate, where a loamy riverstone minerality courses through black currant flavors, finishing on chocolate cake."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Freakshow,20.0,91.0,"Rich, ripe and oaky, this full-bodied wine has loads of sweet blackberry and black cherry flavors, with generous doses of oak spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, wood smoke and dark chocolate. It's bold but complex and will be a lot of fun to drink with red meat."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Malengin,20.0,91.0,"Full, ripe and roundly fruity, this is a good example of the natural opulence of 2009. It has rich black fruits, soft tannins, a dark hint of wood and generous richness. Powered by both its acidity and its structure, it is developing well. Drink from 2014."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Tua Rita,20.0,91.0,"Made with 50% Sangiovese and a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this vibrant red opens with lovely aromas of dark-skinned berry, plum and cake spice. The smooth, vibrant palate doles out black cherries, crushed blackberries, dusty cocoa and aniseed. It's nicely balanced with racy acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Viento,20.0,91.0,"This is declassified ice wine, picked frozen. It does not have the depth of the other dessert wines from Viento, but it is a remarkable effort, textural and delicate, with threads of straw, honey, cracker, candied tropical fruits and more, but all in a light and delicate style. This could easily become a wine that will amaze people in a blind tasting given the price."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Cà dei Frati,20.0,91.0,"Intriguing scents of pressed flower, dried orchard fruit and aromatic herb unfold in the glass. The savory, medium-bodied palate shows nice depth, offering candied citrus, dill, apple, kiwi and toasted almond. Zesty acidity provides balance and freshness. This is an impressive effort, especially for the 2014 vintage."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Cono Sur,20.0,91.0,"Pure on the nose, with a delightful mix of graphite, wild berry, cedar and minerally aromas, this is a rich, plump, mildly tannic Cabernet that will show best in the near term. Flavors of cassis, subdued oak spice and vanilla finish with ripe dark-berry sweetness and proper overall weight. Drink through 2018."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Duorum,20.0,91.0,"To judge by the weight of the bottle, this wine is meant to be taken seriously. In fact, its wood aging is the only serious thing about this attractive, dense and fruity wine. It is finely structured with yellow fruits just supported by the toastiness. Drink the wine now."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Numanthia,20.0,91.0,"Termes always delivers a full taste of Toro at an affordable price. This vintage smells deep, cool and full of cola, rooty blackberry and fine herbs. A flush mouthfeel is tannic but manageable, while ripe, baked flavors of blackberry are savory on the backside and finish lush and deep, with lasting hard tannins. Drink through 2020."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Palmina,20.0,91.0,"There's a honeyed, mead-like character on the nose of this Steve Clifton wine. It also shows buttered brioche, lemon curds and an underlying white rock minerality. Ruby-red grapefruit flesh and ripe nectarine flavors arrive once sipped, and a chalky grip ensues, making for a very dynamic and intriguing wine."
Chardonnay,US,New York,Lamoreaux Landing,20.0,91.0,"While lavishly oaky and luscious in feel, this barrel-fermented Chardonnay maintains balance and levity. It's a ripe, plump wine, but fresh in acidity and delicate apple, lemon and spice flavors. A kiss of vanilla lingers nicely on the finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Roche-Guillon,20.0,91.0,"This ripe, generous wine is full of the bold red fruits of this fine vintage. It also has structure, spicy wood flavors and a rich, full character. With its juicy acidity in the background and its impressive density, the wine is going to age a little longer. It will be best from late 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Poças,20.0,91.0,"Smooth wine, the wood aging underlaying the cherry and ripe plum fruit flavors. It is powerful, yes, although there is a great sense of style from the ripe fruit integrated into rich tannins and final acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Duorum,20.0,91.0,"A dense wine with great spicy fruit, open and generous. This is a wine that feels powerful, structured and concentrated. It needs aging for at least 3–4 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Penley Estate,20.0,91.0,"Really nicely done, with bold cassis aromas tinged with hints of tomato leaf and vanilla and then waves of cassis, vanilla and dried spices on the palate. It's full bodied and lushly textured, with a long, velvety feel to the finish. Best from 2010–2020."
Viognier,US,Washington,Ott & Murphy,20.0,91.0,"It's labeled Viognier, but the blend includes 20% Roussanne and a bit of Marsanne as well. It works terrifically, yielding a wine with a spicy mix of grapefruit, citrus rind, and Asian pear. Wonderful mouthfeel, with cut, focus and length."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Colombier,20.0,91.0,"Producer Jean-Yves Bretaudeau enjoys showing how well Muscadet can age. In this cuvée, now five years old, all the signs of freshness are still there, just that they are given an edge of nuttiness as well as spice. The wine is impressive, crisp and also full of character. Drink now."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Bestheim,20.0,91.0,"Beautifully pure and creamy notes of golden apple dominate the nose. The palate has a similarly gentle apple note that harmonizes perfectly with the light, dry body and the fine bubbles. This elegant pink sparkler will give lots of pleasure before and during a meal."
Riesling,US,California,Zocker,20.0,91.0,"Baking soda, ripe citrus pith, lime blossoms and a soft petrol touch show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard to watch in southern San Luis Obispo County. Tons of sprinkling acidity shows once sipped, with the nervy palate offering orange oil, lemon pith and peel, chamomile, goldenseal root and sunflower-seed flavors."
Syrah,US,California,Terre Rouge,20.0,91.0,"Concentrated and slightly reserved at the same time, this deep-colored and full-bodied wine shows outstanding blackberry and blueberry flavors and a mouth-coating texture of fine-grained tannins. Still, it is not overripe, over oaked or over done, but is strong and beautifully balanced."
Red Blend,US,California,Terre Rouge,20.0,91.0,"Meaty, savory aromas, and lush, dense cherry and berry flavors put a lot of personality into this medium-bodied, ripe and luxurious-feeling wine. It's effusive enough to fill the mouth and satisfy the taste buds, but still dry enough for great balance."
Assyrtico,Greece,Santorini,Greek Wine Cellars,20.0,91.0,"Alluring aromas of ripe peach, grapefruit and lemon lead this stylish white. The wine offers integrated flavors of spicy citrus and lemon peel backed by a sea-salt salinity. Balanced and brisk but full of flavor, it's a great example of the elegance of this variety."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Jean-Maurice Raffault,20.0,91.0,"From the plateau that lies between the Loire and Vienne rivers, this is a firm, mineral structured wine. It has power and juicy red fruits that also show dark, dry tannins. It's a concentrated and dense wine for medium-term aging."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,20.0,91.0,"With its silver embossed label and wax capsule this is a luxury cuvée from the Plaimont cooperative. The wine is firm, and still quite youthful after four years, integrating its tannins with the concentrated fruit. Wait for at least five more years for this impressive wine to show its best."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,20.0,91.0,"Dark garnet in the glass, this wine's bouquet offers notes of raspberry, cassis and butterscotch. Harmonious on the palate, its flavors of cherry, black plum, chocolate, anise and smoke are set in a framework of sturdy tannins that give way to a bright finish with a closing touch of smoke."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Domdechant Werner,20.0,91.0,"Brisk acidity and a crushed mineral sheen add levity to this dry, richly textured Riesling. The palate shows cool, penetrating lime zest and lemongrass tones. It's an elegant, subtle wine from a vintage that produced quite a few bruisers in this region."
Zinfandel,US,California,Hilt & Blade,20.0,91.0,"Solidly built and fruity without seeming sweet, this full-bodied wine combines concentrated flavors with a firm structure of fine-grained tannins and supportive acidity. Light oak touches add interest, but the wine's power and appeal come from bold varietal-fruit flavors."
Riesling,New Zealand,Marlborough,Spy Valley,20.0,91.0,"Made in a convincing dry style, this medium-bodied wine starts off with hints of lime and kerosene, then adds peach kernel and citrus flavors on the smooth-textured palate. Finishes long."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Sainte-Béatrice,20.0,91.0,"This is the ripest wine in the Béatrice range. With generous red fruits and balanced acidity it has weight and richness alongside the crisp, tangy fruitiness. This is a textured wine with spice and pepper flavors to add complexity to the fruit. Drink the wine from late 2017."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Dragon,20.0,91.0,"Located at the base of the Sainte-Victoire mountain, this vineyard, owned by the Dragon family for four generations, has produced a ripe wine, full-bodied and with concentration. It has raspberry flavors and a touch of spice that gives the wine extra richness. Drink this dense wine from late 2017."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Véronique Günther-Chereau,20.0,91.0,"This mature Muscadet is one that is in peak condition. In losing its youthful acidity, it has gained a depth of flavor and ripe apple and pear fruits that give it intensity as well as a strongly perfumed character. Drink this wine now."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Weingut Christ,20.0,91.0,"Crisp, crunchy apple and pear fruit appears first. This is followed by both more generous apple juice and tarter citrus notes. The midpalate shows concentration and some gentle but determined power. Texture and acidity lend structure to a wine that feels weightier than it is. Wonderfully balanced and dangerously moreish."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,20.0,91.0,"Powerfully rich, with plenty of the dry tannins of Tannat, but also rich sweet plum fruits and concentrated wood to soften and round. There is acidity, but it fits comfortably into the firm fruits and solid final chunkiness."
Merlot,Chile,Marchigue,Viña Bisquertt,20.0,91.0,"Jammy aromas of crushed boysenberry and cassis are rich and ripe. This is a direct, fruit-forward Merlot with moderate but noticeable acidity and a generous baked-blackberry flavor that finishes warm, toasty and with ample depth. Drink through 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château des Lattes,20.0,91.0,"Full, ripe and juicy, this has a flavor of fresh black-currant juice, which is balanced by the dry, firm tannins that promise aging."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Laulerie,20.0,91.0,"Using fruit sourced from vineyards on an eastward extension of the ridge of Castillon and Saint-Emilion in Bordeaux, this finely structured wine shows a judicious amount of oak influence, which supports the ripe blackberry flavor. It's a complex, spicy effort, and its fruit is finely layered with acidity and toast."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Amavi,20.0,91.0,"Consistent with recent vintages, this lovely Sémillon opens immediately into a creamy, leesy, expressive core. Scents of green apple, lemon and beeswax turn into lush fruit flavors of melon, pear and citrus. It shows far more complex and interesting fruit character than most unoaked Chardonnays—here, the acids are not intrusive, but come up naturally in the back of the throat."
Sémillon,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,20.0,91.0,"This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past. The thyme and rosemary streak continues into and through the finish, while the fruit maintains its power and polish, with just the lightest barrel influence perceptible in a kiss of toast."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,20.0,91.0,"This medium- to full-bodied wine manages to be mouthfilling and round without being excessively soft or syrupy. A savory, meaty, coffee-like note complements the ripe blackberry fruit, which persists a good long time on the finish. Drink now–2015."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,20.0,91.0,"The wine is initially light and fruity. It then opens up to give a much richer character that involves ripe white stone fruit and intense acidity. It is dense, with a tangy edge that adds minerality to the complex mix. This is part of a series of wines named after the subsoil in which the vines are planted. The fine wine is ready to drink."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Chehalem,20.0,91.0,"Just slightly off-dry, this excellent bottle mixes its ripe lemon, orange and papaya fruit with breakfast tea-like flavors. Its acidity is ample enough to keep the sweetness at bay, making it a fine, all-purpose wine that should please a wide variety of palates."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Dozon,20.0,91.0,"This wine comes from a single vineyard on the south bank of the Vienne river. It is ripe, perfumed and generously rich with concentrated blackberry fruit and balanced tannins. Some wood aging has broadened the wine rather than adding flavor. The wine could age another year with noticeable benefit, so drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Nigl,20.0,91.0,"The understated but alluring perfume of ripe pear peel leads the nose of this wine. Its concentrated body has the lovely, peppery, yeasty midpalate feel that we always hope for in Grüner. Subtle, light, savory and fresh, it finishes dry and zesty."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Salomon-Undhof,20.0,91.0,"The savoriness of yeast still lingers on the nose of this wine. The palate brings herbal and sage-like notes to the fore, highlighting its concentrated, rich flavor. Citrus overtones herald the finish, while the saltiness demands you take another sip."
Riesling,US,Washington,Apex,20.0,91.0,"This is 100% Riesling, and the intense, floral aromas suggest a smattering of Gewürztraminer, at least in essence if not in fact. Beeswax, lemon candy, orange blossom and other juicy citrus components swirl around the palate, making this an exceptionally complex and beguiling wine. Though labeled dry, it carries an impression of fruit sweetness, rather than the bracing minerality of some other dry Rieslings. A wine that is almost Germanic in its attack, and a truly lovely bottle."
Vidal Blanc,Canada,Ontario,Jackson-Triggs,20.0,91.0,"It's no surprise that excellent icewine is being made in the Niagara region of Canada, but this Vidal offering from Jackson-Triggs is a pleasure nonetheless. With its layered aromas and flavors of orange, apricot and honey lifted by crisp acidity, this is both approachable and collectible. A serious wine with a fun and flirty side. Imported by Icon Estates."
Red Blend,France,Provence,Château la Gordonne,20.0,91.0,"This ripe wine has jammy red fruit flavors. The fruitiness is given structure by the stalky tannins and the dry, wood-aging flavors. Black cherries and juicy black currants show strongly. It needs to age, so drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,US,California,Bogle,20.0,91.0,"This is a full-bodied and extroverted wine. It smells like melted butter and baking spices and tastes like nougat and caramel with just a touch of sweetness. Oaky in a moderate way, it offers great citrus and pineapple on the midpalate and a lingering finish."
Pinot Blanc,US,California,Chalone Vineyard,20.0,91.0,"Exotic yellow-spice notes meet with lean lime pith on the light and crisp nose of this old-vine expression from a historic winery. Meyer-lemon rind and juice show brightly on the palate, where grippy chalkiness complements rich lemon-curd flavors."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Roland Schmitt,20.0,91.0,"Pure notes of Conference pear define both nose and palate. The body is textured and concentrated but remains slender. Fresh acidity, dryness and slightly bitter pitch make for a beautiful, poised outline. Purity and length stand out."
Pinot Blanc,Austria,Burgenland,Prieler,20.0,91.0,"A rather neutral nose leads to a brisk and citric palate that is buffered by leesy texture and just a touch of smoke. This is so subtly done that there is quite a thrill between lemony, bright freshness and sonorous roundedness. This will benefit from a little bottle age and will be more mellow in 2016. Right now it's fresh and beautifully bracing."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Omaka Springs,20.0,91.0,"Hints of struck flint and white currant lead the way, followed by herbal, currant-like flavors and notes of fresh fig. This is medium-bodied, but with hints of creaminess to its texture and a long, wet-stone finish."
Grüner Veltliner,US,California,Zocker,20.0,91.0,"This grape, seldom planted on the Central Coast, produces a wine that boasts intense aromas of passion fruit juice and candied grapefruit. It's lively and ripe on the palate, with white rose and apple blossom flavors, yet balanced, with lime peel, cut grass and steel accents."
Riesling,US,California,Zocker,20.0,91.0,"This shows petrol, honey and brie cheese rind notes on the nose, and is quite creamy once sipped, yet the edges are punctuated with orange peel bitterness. The tartness ensures cellaring potential, so drink 2018–2025."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Roland Schmitt,20.0,91.0,"So elegant, a wine with just a fine balance. It has creamy apple fruit flavors, hedgerow fruits, with a line of crisp acidity to cut through the fruitiness and give a more mineral edge. It will be worth aging this wine for 2–3 years. Drink after 2014."
Baga-Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Beiras,Quinta de Foz de Arouce,20.0,91.0,"Big, black colored wine that is firm and solid while also offering smooth richness. It has concentration, dense and bitter tannins that need time to soften out. Powerful and dense, age this wine for at least four years."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Bibbiano,20.0,91.0,"This charming wine has a bright character, showing notes of juicy wild cherry, mint and eucalyptus and accents of leather and truffle. Drink now or wait a few years for tannins to tame down."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Monte da Ravasqueira,20.0,91.0,"Produced from selected parcels, this wine is solid with rich tannins and dark fruit. It has the flavors of new oak aging well integrated into the ripe texture and juicy acidity. Still firm, with tannins well in place, it needs to age a little longer. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,20.0,91.0,"Winemaker Kevin Mitchell has been gradually refining his style, pulling back on alcohol and oak without sacrificing fruit intensity. This is a fruit-driven Cabernet, loaded with black cherries and cassis and supported by restrained, just-right oak levels. It's medium-bodied, softly dusty yet firm, with a surprisingly long finish. Drink now–2025."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Navarro,20.0,91.0,"Rich but lively and dry, this wine packs a potpourri of spices and citrus fruits in its aromas and flavors, carrying them through to a lingering finish. Substantial and appetizing as an apéritif and excellent with seafood."
Friulano,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Comelli,20.0,91.0,"Fragrances recall acacia flower, chamomile, stone fruit and a whiff of dried hay. The savory palate offers intense white peach, Bartlett pear and yellow apple accented with mineral and almond notes alongside crisp acidity. It's well balanced with a long, lingering finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Carnuntum,Glatzer,20.0,91.0,"The fragrant freshness of cut Conference pears with grassy undertones promises immediate invigoration. A background of peppery savoriness, spicy length and mouthfeel destine this for food."
Riesling,US,California,Nacina,20.0,91.0,"Classic varietal smells of chalk and golden raisin emerge from this wine. It's lusciously smooth once sipped, with orange, limestone and vanilla pudding leaning up against bitter greens and just-ripe nectarine. Serve with beets and goat cheese or Chinese chicken salad."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,20.0,91.0,"Slight yeasty notes still cling to the nose but the palate opens up to peach and Mirabelle, to lemon zest and the freshest, crunchiest apples imaginable. This is pure, linear, ripe and poised. Aromatic citrus zest swirls above everything and leaves you refreshed and entranced."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Rame,20.0,91.0,"Ripe fruit, new wood flavors and a rounded character give this structured and textured wine a fine sense of shape. It has weight, richness and a well balanced texture. Age it for four years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Tonnelle,20.0,91.0,"Mint aromas and new wood flavors mark this smoothly ripe, polished wine. It has a good amount of black fruit, a dry but open texture and a rich, smoky character. The tannins and generous fruit power the wine forward."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,J. Christopher,20.0,91.0,"Neither oak aging nor malolactic fermentation was used here, hence the name. But far from madness, this wine is sleek, sensual, skillful and seductive. Crisp acidity, lemony minerality, an overriding freshness and excellent depth of flavor all combine to create a wine that seems to be more than the sum of its parts. Shellfish, light seafood, poultry and even pork dishes would be fine matches."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,San Martino,20.0,91.0,"Subdued aromas of dark-skinned berry, baking spice, truffle and leather slowly emerge in the glass. The chewy, delicious palate is more expressive, delivering juicy black cherry, raspberry jam, white pepper and a mineral note while firm, refined tannins provide youthful tension. Enjoy through 2020."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Horse & Plow,20.0,91.0,"Made from organic grapes, Horse & Plow's Pinot Gris is earthy and austere, with finely honed acidity and lovely hints of apricot. Very balanced, dry, a tremendous version of this white wine."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Rulo,20.0,91.0,"Young and still a bit yeasty, with the flavors still integrating. The toasty barrel and bourbon flavors are matched to medium acids and stone fruits. This needs more time in the bottle to show all its strengths."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Wirra Wirra,20.0,91.0,"At 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a firm, cassis-scented wine, but one that includes hints of ripeness and generous fruit. Dried herbs and brown sugar add nuance, while the velvety finish picks up some meaty, savory notes. Drink now–2025."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Don Manuel Villafañe,20.0,91.0,"Dry, mossy berry aromas carry punch, while this well-built Malbec feels concentrated but not heavy. Peppery, blackened berry flavors spill over with a black-coffee note on a slightly hot finish. Drink through 2020."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Constantia,Buitenverwachting,20.0,91.0,"Despite its age, this white still offers upfront ripe-fruit aromas of citrus, pear and apple, but is graced with additional complex accents of hazelnut, toasted oak, orange blossom, lanolin and soft, chalky minerality. Pineapple, fig and apple-flesh flavors fill the palate, with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and ample acidic lift to the long, gently textured finish."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Paetra,20.0,91.0,"This well-made wine offers cherry pie flavors, evoking fruit but also crust, with excellent concentration and length. Despite its modest alcohol, it's a persistent, powerful rosé with enough concentration to stand up to entrées as rich as roast pork or chicken."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Antonio Lopes Ribeiro,20.0,91.0,"Produced from the Dão's top white grapes, this wine is a beautiful combination of apricot-like fruitiness and taut texture. Full of crisp acidity and richer fruits, it will age well. Drink from 2018."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Wyndham Estate,20.0,91.0,"This wine represents an excellent value, and one that showcases the quality potential of Langhorne Creek. It's creamy in texture, voluptuous in feel and full in body, with a bold flavor of red currant that's framed by ample cedar and vanilla notes. Long and creamy on the finish. Drink now–2018."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,J. & F. Lurton,20.0,91.0,"Meaty, cuddly and kind is the best way to describe this big-boned, ultra ripe Toro. What makes it great is the price ($20 is a steal for this) and the complete lack of fierceness. It's easygoing but complex, with pulsing blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With modest but measurable tannins, it should age nicely for at least five years and maybe more, making it a bargain hunter's dream."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Tulpen,20.0,91.0,"A juicy, delicious Sangio, whose bright acidity underscores a lush mix of raspberries, blackberries, boysenberries and plum. The alcohol is a substantial 14.8%. The wine benefits from an extra year of bottle age, and is now beginning to hint at grace notes of leaf and tobacco."
Viognier,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,20.0,91.0,"Shows all the beautiful Viognier notes you could ask for: flowers, spice, apricot and melon, carried by a succulent mouthfeel that remains fresh and vibrant from start to lingeringly spicy finish. Drink now."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Zuccardi,20.0,91.0,"A home run in middle-tier Malbec. Excellent power and balance are on display. It's firm, minerally and tight, but with generous berry and cassis aromas and flavors along with ample coffee, spice and mocha qualities. Impressive, especially given the price tag; drink now through 2014."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,20.0,91.0,"Enticing fragrances suggest alpine wild flower, stone fruit and savory herb. The linear palate is loaded with finesse and character, delivering creamy green apple, tangerine, mineral, white peach and mint. It's well balanced with bright acidity."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,20.0,91.0,"Vibrant and elegant, this opens with classic varietal aromas of elderberry flower, passion fruit, crushed tomato vine, dry hay and stone fruit. The linear palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, juicy citrus and a vein of mineral alongside bright acidity."
Romorantin,France,Loire Valley,Benoît Daridan,20.0,91.0,"Cour-Cheverny is a miniscule appellation of 180 acres within Cheverny, specializing in the rare Romorantin grapes. With care, as here, this hard-to-ripen grape can produce a remarkably rich, full-bodied wine even in a tough vintage. It's bone-dry with delicious melon and apple flavors. Drink now, but better wait until late 2015."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Barão de Vilar,20.0,91.0,"This structured wine is balanced with great fruit, firm tannins and ripe berry flavors. Drink this impressive wine from 2019."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Henri Bonnaud,20.0,91.0,"This is a ripe, beautifully balanced wine. It has the extra richness and density that comes from a wine produced from vines close to Mont Sainte-Victoire. Full of raspberry and orange fruits, it has a pleasantly tangy, herbal edge on the finish. Drink now."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine d'Eole,20.0,91.0,"With vineyards located in the small range of mountains known as the Alpilles (little Alps), this wine comes from a beautiful organic estate. The wine, with its full range of Provence grapes in the blend, is packed with red fruits. It has a tight texture that points up the fruitiness. Drink this finely structured wine now."
Chardonnay,US,California,Qupé,20.0,91.0,"One of the first releases since Charles Banks invested in Bob Lindquist's pioneering brand, this wine shows Japanese apple, lemon blossoms, lightly browned butter and a touch of tropicality on the nose. Still a bit wound up, the wine conveys potential length, with green-apple skins, nectarine flesh, cement-like minerality and a chive herb lift."
Riesling,US,California,Jana,20.0,91.0,"Classic smoky, spicy aromas and complex fruit flavors make this dry, light-bodied wine from veteran winemaker Scott Harvey fascinating to taste. Its green apple, grapefruit and peach hints are accented with light floral, spicy touches. Vibrant acidity keeps it lively and appetizing with each sip."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Jenke,20.0,91.0,"This Barossa Shiraz eschews the superripe character found in many from the region in favor of a more balanced, Rhône-ish approach. There's a base of raspberry and vanilla sweetness, but also lots of herbal and spice complexity—notably cracked pepper and black olives. Has enough soft tannins to suggest drinking now–2018. Imported by 34th Parallel, LLC."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Eisenberg,Jalits,20.0,91.0,"Wild bilberries abound on nose and palate and scent the entire drinking experience. The palate is fresh and vivid, as befits the slender red vintage of 2014. This has been handled with great care and turned out into a wine of elegance with poised, pure fruit and gentle structure."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,20.0,91.0,"This Douro wine is a new venture for Lagoalva, which is based in Tejo near Lisbon. Fermented in open stone fermenters, the wine is rich, endowed with fine tannins that are integrated into the full-bodied black fruits. The finish has acidity, layers of wood and a smooth aftertaste. Drink now."
Port,Portugal,Port,Royal Oporto,20.0,91.0,This is a rich complex wine from a great vintage Port year. It has much of the same intense fruit as the vintage wines but with the advantage of longer aging in barrel to allow the rich dark plum and spice to be more ready to drink. It is bottled to be drunk now although another six months into 2017 will make it even better.
St. Laurent,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,20.0,91.0,"Aromatic blueberry scents this wine on nose and palate. The body is light but vivid with white pepper and crunchy, fresh, vibrant fruit. This is St. Laurent picked at exactly the right point of ripeness: luscious but still bright! A real treat with its long, smooth finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sea Monster,20.0,91.0,"This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose. The energetic palate offers just-cut green pears at first, then opens into a touch of vanilla. It tightens back down on green apple peels before ending with vanilla cream. The wine delivers a full experience."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Museum,20.0,91.0,"This Tempranillo from little-known Cigales opens with potent crushed brick, spice, toasty oak and berry aromas. The palate has a juicy, fresh outlook and no excess weight or overextraction. Its plum, berry, spice and vanilla flavors finish with a note of mature, sweet tobacco. Drink through 2020."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,20.0,91.0,"Evocatively tender notes of Conference pear appear on the nose. The palate is ample with juicy pear and has a generous dollop of residual sweetness. Nonetheless, this is balanced by vigorous lively freshness, leaving a harmonious, rounded, light-footed and elegant wine with a moreish finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,20.0,91.0,"From this family-owned estate in the heart of great Port country, this wine is both richly structured and packed with fruit. It has solid black fruits that are laced with intense acidity to keep the wine bright and crisp. At the same time, the tannins and the firm texture will allow it to age. Drink from 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Robert Weil,20.0,91.0,"Subtle notes of white grapefruit and struck flint intensify on the palate of this off-dry wine. Fresh tangerine sweetness is subtle and integrated, offset by nervy acidity and a cool, steely finish."
Merlot,Portugal,Bairrada,Nelson Neves,20.0,91.0,"This is a powerfully structured wine from one of the pioneers of Merlot in Bairrada. It is dark with tannins while also brimming with great black-fruit flavors. Rounded, balancing fruit and acidity, the wine is smooth, rich and now ready to drink."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château de Chambert,20.0,91.0,"This is an impressively dark, rich wine made from biodynamically grown grapes to give pure perfumed fruitiness over dense, dusty tannins. The wine has a mineral texture to balance the black currant fruits and generous ripeness. It does need to age: give it until 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,20.0,91.0,"Fruity and juicy, this attractive wine has delicious soft tannins that are already balanced with the ripe fruitiness, which suggests it will develop quickly. The wine comes from Pinhão the estate owned by the Bergqvist family. Drink from 2019."
Shiraz-Grenache,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,20.0,91.0,"This 50-50 blend is firm, focused and rich, offering attractive aromas of mint, vanilla, cedar and red-skinned plums. Flavors turn darker, suggesting espresso and chocolate, but enlivened by bright acids. A wine worth holding a few years, priced at $20? Buy now, drink after 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,Australia,Western Australia,Leeuwin Estate,20.0,91.0,"This blend of two-thirds Sauvignon Blanc and one-third Semillon gets a touch of barrel aging, reflected in its silky texture more than any overt aromas or flavors. The palate is fruit-forward, offering hints of citrus, underripe nectarine, wet stone and green apple, finishing long and mouthwatering."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Four Graces,20.0,91.0,"Well differentiated from the winery's Pinot Blanc, this round and fleshy wine offers freshly cut pear fruit with a burst of orange juice and peel. It's bright, lively, spicy and a great all-purpose white wine when you need a break from Chardonnay."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Jim Barry,20.0,91.0,"This is a terrific value in balanced, ready-to-drink Australian Cabernet. It brings several Bordeaux-ish qualities to the table—medium body, silky tannins and aromas reminiscent of cigar box and Ribena—then adds varietally true flavors and a long finish. Drink now–2025."
Syrah,US,California,Alexander Valley Vineyards,20.0,91.0,This affordable wine offers tangy oak and tannin along with vibrant red fruit. Leather and juicy black plum add to its soft layers of flavor.
Roussanne,US,California,Truchard,20.0,91.0,"Packs plenty of powerful complexity into a dry wine that's a pretty good price. Made in full-Burgundian style, with barrel fermentation and lees aging, it's a rich, creamy wine packed with spicy tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Try as an interesting alternative to an upscale Chardonnay."
Syrah,US,California,Frey,20.0,91.0,"This full-bodied and tannic wine balances richness and restraint well. The color is basically black with a smoky red rim, while the aroma is full of inviting ripe fruit, like boysenberries and blackberries with a whiff of wet earth and dried herbs. Flavors are almost as rich as the aroma, and the texture is quite grippy with tannins to give it structure."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Lemelson,20.0,91.0,"A pungent, sappy Riesling, with a strong scent of rock and rind. This is powerful stuff—dry and a bit lean, but packed with texture and flavor. Subtle hints of citrus, pear and honey weave through. This needs more time to develop in the bottle."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot,20.0,91.0,"This well-proportioned wine has ripe fruits along with generous texture and acidity. A touch of wood gives extra weight. It's ready to drink, but will be even better by the end of 2014."
Red Blend,US,California,Gifft,20.0,91.0,"Kathie Lee Gifford teams with Monterey County's Scheid Vineyards for this wine, which features 42% Merlot, 25% Petite Sirah, 12% Syrah and 10% Petit Verdot. There's a mix of iron, coffee and crushed, dried violet on the Old World-leaning nose. The herbal elegance continues on the palate, with dried oregano seasoning the dark black and blue fruit elements."
Zinfandel,US,California,Renwood,20.0,91.0,"A ripe and tasty style of Zinfandel from a grand old name in the Sierra Foothills. The maple and brown sugar tones from new oak integrate well with ripe but not overripe fruit flavors. Touches of clove and black pepper come out as you sip, adding welcome nuances."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Terre Rouge,20.0,91.0,"Anyone making Grenache Blanc in California should be encouraged, Terre Rouge's version being a delightfully drinkable mix of apple and peach with a rich, full mouth that finishes crisp. Grown at high elevation (2,200 feet) on the Hawk Creek Vineyard in Sierra Foothills, a small production worth seeking out. And it's only 13% alcohol."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,South Africa,Paarl,Glen Carlou,20.0,91.0,"This blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Malbec, 14% Merlot, 13% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers a minty character that prevails among the intense black plum and berry aromas and flavors. Well-integrated, with a decadent crushed velvet texture and a long oak-kissed finish reminiscent of dark chocolate-covered cherries."
Riesling,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,20.0,91.0,"This dry Riesling boasts intense apricot, yellow peach, citrus and smoky mineral sensations. The rich but polished palate is restrained by crisp acidity that leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Coelho,20.0,91.0,"Rich and ripe, with some Chardonnay-like power, it's a lush mix of tropical fruit flavors—guava and banana and more. A lovely vein of caramel runs across the palate, and makes this simply irresistible."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Hourtin-Ducasse,20.0,91.0,Low yields have produced a concentrated wine. The tannins are powerful and dense—a fine foil to the ripe juicy black-currant fruit. The impressive wine is going to take its time to be ready to drink with richness and tight structure. Drink from 2021.
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Vintage Cowboy,20.0,91.0,"Honeysuckle, wet cement and ripe nectarine show on the tightly wound and bright nose of this bottling from a winery near the Pozo Saloon in southeastern Paso. A ripping acidity starts off the sip, where bright lime blossoms, honeydew rind and light lemongrass flavors make for a very tasty wine."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Southard,20.0,91.0,"This bone-dry, Southern Rhône-style blend consists of 61% Grenache, 18% Mourvèdre, 12% Cinsault and 9% Counoise. Elegant and detailed flavors of light berry and Bing cherry are dusted with a cocoa accent."
Petite Sirah,US,Washington,Thurston Wolfe,20.0,91.0,"This is a brambly, blueberry-laden Petite Sirah, with black cherry, plum and chocolate highlights. Firm, ripe tannins bring a streak of lemon verbena. It's gently earthy, absolutely flavorful and drinking beautifully."
Viognier,US,Washington,Alexandria Nicole,20.0,91.0,"Very fresh and juicy, this mouth-pleasing Viognier mixes peaches and grapefruit, zippy acidity, with highlights of lemon zest. It's beautifully balanced, detailed and refreshing."
Viognier,US,California,Zaca Mesa,20.0,91.0,"Rich but not overly tropical on the nose, this bottling shows buttered nectarine and a touch of honeydew on the nose. The palate is expertly wound up, with bright tangerine, ripe melon and creamy cherimoya, all reined in by a wet cement-like texture."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Amavi,20.0,91.0,"This Sémillon is made from all Walla Walla Valley fruit, with 11% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. It was barrel-fermented and -aged, and the time in barrel and on the lees has given the wine an extra dimension of texture. The fruit flavors mix white peach and ripe apple, with a streak of chamomile tea."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Casarena,20.0,91.0,"This is a rich, plush Cabernet, with a sense of elegance. It smells like prune, blackberry, coffee and toast. The concentrated palate boasts prune, olive, coffee and dark berry flavors. Drink or hold for a few years."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Alexandria Nicole,20.0,91.0,"This Rhône-style blend—two-thirds Roussanne, the rest divided between Marsanne and Viognier—was made using grapes sourced from the estate Destiny Ridge Vineyard. Intriguing aromas suggest clover, sweet grass and honeysuckle, while the flavors run from stone fruits into hints of light tropical fruits. It's lovely and evocative."
Chenin Blanc,US,Oregon,Ledger David,20.0,91.0,"Chenin Blanc is quite rare in Oregon, and this wine, from vines planted just five years previously, may inspire others to follow suit. Aromas of fresh herb and citrus oil lead into a tangy palate with lime, lemon verbena and expressive minerality. The balance and length are just right, and the varietal character is in evidence throughout."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,20.0,91.0,"Markus Huber manages to get great ripe, full flavors from his Grüners. That's the main character of this wine, from a single vineyard, that offers rich creamed pear and nutmeg flavors along with a shot of acidity to contrast. Screwcap."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,20.0,91.0,"From a very cool vintage, this wine takes full advantage of the flavors the year delivered. Bracing and fresh, with a lively mix of lime and citrus fruits, its vivid acidity and a wash of wet rock, give it life and length across the palate. Complex and textural, this is a lovely wine."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Penfolds,20.0,91.0,"Features an admirably lean, elegantly fine line of acids from start to finish, off of which hang notes of crushed stone, green apple and lime, with just the merest hints of riper fruit, like nectarine. Crisp and long, this should develop well over the next 5–10 years."
Shiraz,Israel,Galilee,Or Haganuz,20.0,91.0,"Aromas of black cherry and green pepper prepare the taste buds for flavors of black cherry, blackberry, green bell pepper and espresso bean. Silky tannins glide across the palate as flavors evolve from fruit forward to slightly vegetal. The finished is marked by a return to bright berry notes and a touch of eucalyptus."
Grenache,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,20.0,91.0,"The 2011 vintage wasn't an easy one in South Australia to say the least, which makes this wine all the more admirable. Mouthwatering, peppery, red-currant fruit remains firm and focused from start to finish, ending on a crisp note. Drink now–2023."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine les Pins,20.0,91.0,"This is a solid, firm and ripe wine. With its dry structure and still youthful tannins, it has weight and the potential to age. The smoky aromas and fragrant berry fruits are bursting out of the glass, giving a ripe wine that should be drunk after 2016."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Dürnberg,20.0,91.0,"Smoky hints play about the nose but the palate comes through with green pears, pear peel, grapefruit zest and yeasty, peppery savoriness. Layers of flavor emerge, and savory spice wins the day. This will be compelling with soft cheeses."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,20.0,91.0,"Muscular and slightly austere, this wine does offer attractive notes of mint and blueberry. Some meaty nuances creep in, adding welcome complexity. Although firm, it's approachable now, yet should age well through 2025."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,20.0,91.0,"This is made in an earthy-savory style, offering hints of roasted meat, black olives and espresso. It's also firmly constructed, with firm tannins that suggest a couple of years of cellar time would do it some good. Drink 2018 through 2025."
Carmenère,Chile,Rapel Valley,Misiones de Rengo,20.0,91.0,"Looking for a juggernaut red that cries out for steak? Give this lush, stylish, nearly flawless Carmenère a shot and you won't be disappointed. The nose opens with toast, mineral, herbs, olive and berry fruit, and the palate is more of the same. In terms of feel, it's smooth and elegant, yet ripe and forceful. Finishes crusty and long. A winner from a winery that up until now hasn't shown much."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Still Waters,20.0,91.0,"Banana blends with cut grass for a tropical-meets-traditional take. On the palate, the wine is very soft, reminiscent of pineapple-flavored whipped cream, and there is a nice touch of smoke as well."
G-S-M,US,California,Zaca Mesa,20.0,91.0,"The exciting range of aromas include the rose petal lift of Grenache and a citrusy mix of grapefruit and grenadine, as well as iron, whole peppercorns and Dr. Pepper soda. It's quite smooth once sipped, with tart cranberry-orange fruit and noticeable tannins."
Viognier,US,California,Sensorium,20.0,91.0,"Orange marmalade, lemon meringue and warm melon aromas open this wine from the cool Templeton Gap area southeast of Paso Robles. The flavors show off the brighter elements of the grape, with caramelized pear giving way to slate in the midpalate and a nicely bitter finish of orange peel."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Jean-Luc Mader,20.0,91.0,"If you want spicy Gewurztraminer then go no further. This has lychee, sweet spice and apricot notes with just a touch of honey. It's not quite dry, as its richness propels it into a richer category. Drink now and over the next year or two."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Roland Schmitt,20.0,91.0,"A rich, ripe wine and full in the mouth yet still developing. It has weight, fine spiciness and tropical fruit flavors with just a hint of honey to balance its dryness. Full-bodied while stylish. Keep for 2–3 years."
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Esterházy,20.0,91.0,"Structured tannins dominate this blend of Blaufränkisch, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon right now, but dense yet sleeping plummy fruit and oaky spice are waiting in the background for their time to shine. This will relax into something slinky and fruitful if you have the patience to wait a year or two; drink after 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Alysian,20.0,91.0,"Part stainless-steel fermented, part neutral French oak-fermented, this light, refreshingly upfront wine offers bristling acidity around shocks of grapefruit, lemon and lime, settling into itself as it goes. The oak is well integrated and nicely subtle, allowing the fruit and minerality to speak."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,20.0,91.0,"All coming from Block 95 of the winery's estate vineyard, this is a beguiling wine with a complex range of notes that include caramel, spice, squash and cream. It shows excellent balance, length and finesse, with the enjoyment as much about mouth-feel as flavor."
Grenache,US,California,Bonny Doon,20.0,91.0,"This bottling from five vineyards across the region, which also includes 18% Syrah, is dark and concentrated on the nose with aromas of plum, crushed gravel, rose petals, composting violets and gamy pepper-crusted meats. The palate is more fresh and floral, with lilac touches and kola nut spice, proving lighter weight in body and easy to quaff."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Ricaud,20.0,91.0,"New wood aromas set the scene for this ripe, fuity and toasty wine. It has plenty of black plum fruit, rich tannins and a dry core that will soften. The texture is polished and ripe. Drink from 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Encostas de Estremoz,20.0,91.0,"This is a rich, powerful wine. It is dense, with dusty tannins and great swathes of ripe black fruits. The acidity, crisp and generous at the same time, is well integrated with the fruit. Its solid, firm texture promises aging. Drink this serious, concentrated wine from 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Odfjell,20.0,91.0,"Great wine and great value, too. The nose is a blend of floral, graphite and cassis aromas, while the firm and rugged palate is packed with sweet, friendly cookie, chocolate, coffee and berry flavors. If the tannins seem a little aggressive now, time should come to the rescue. Otherwise, there's very little to pick at and a lot more to praise."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Western Australia,Howard Park,20.0,91.0,"Howard Park's single-vineyard wines continue to impress for their value and consistency. The 2004 Leston is a richly textured, velvety Cab, marked by earthy, loamy scents and classic cassis, vanilla and tobacco flavors. Drink 2009–2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château des Arnauds,20.0,91.0,"Vines with an average age of 30 years give this wine good intensity that balances the firm, dark tannins. It's a powerful, concentrated Merlot-based wine, big and generous. Ripe plums and berries show strongly through the tannic structure. Give this wine until 2017 before drinking."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,20.0,91.0,"A whiff of pine frond lends an invigorating alpine air to this lean, refreshingly mineral dry Riesling. The palate is crisp and cutting, bursting with fresh lime, gooseberry and quince flavors. Zesty acidity draws out a long, piercing finish. Drink now through 2020."
Syrah,US,California,Klinker Brick,20.0,91.0,"Rich and meaty enough to sink your teeth into, this dark and deep Syrah has toasty, smoky aromas. Generous blackberry and boysenberry flavors that are full but not sweet accompany a velvety texture. This is tasty now, but has the layered tannins and acidity for aging. Best now through 2019."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Esterházy,20.0,91.0,"Pure blueberry and red cherry fruit is pervaded by lashings of aromatic white pepper. It tingles at the edges and gives even more freshness to the fruit. The body is structured by fine-grained but palpable tannins and leaves a long, aromatic trail of cherry behind. This is elegant and seductive."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Penley Estate,20.0,91.0,"The cool Coonawarra region can produce Shiraz with more elegance and complexity than is seen in hot regions, and this is a fine example, balancing ample weight with juicy acidity. Toasty oak frames flavors of cassis and mint, blackberry and spice. Drink this great value from now–2020."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Vignobles Bulliat,20.0,91.0,This wine impresses with its richness and ripe red fruits. It comes from a 20-acre vineyard that gives the wine concentration and juicy acidity. Acidity and the crisp aftertaste give the wine its final lift.
Zinfandel,US,California,Concrete,20.0,91.0,"This full-bodied Zinfandel adds in 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, which is an unusual blend but works really well. It shows a great mix of fruit and spice flavors, with a rich, smooth texture. It's lightly tannic, oozing raspberry and blackberry flavors on the palate and through the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Martin Ray,20.0,91.0,"This is a memorably refreshing and reasonably complex effort, a crisp, delicious mix of tangerine, grapefruit and fresh strawberry made by the saignée method. Meaty, with texture, it's round, balanced and dry. Stock up."
Garnacha,US,Washington,Idilico,20.0,91.0,"Aromas of fresh raspberries, flowers and dried herbs are followed by full-bodied, succulent red-fruit flavors. It shows a pleasing sense of purity and elegance to the jammy fruit flavors."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Tablas Creek,20.0,91.0,"Light banana flambée, vanilla meringue and yellow-cake aromas show on the generous but not overbearing nose of this blend of 49% Grenache Blanc, 31% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 8% Marsanne. The tropicality of the nose disappears on the palate, which is tart and grippy with green apple and Anjou pear flavors as well as a touch of melon and smoke."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,20.0,91.0,"Spicy, exotic and dry, this wine is full of ripe lychee and mango fruits. Rounded, full and deliciously rich, it's perfect for sipping or for accompanying rich fish sauces. A wine for aging over 2–3 years. Screwcap."
Mourvèdre,Australia,South Australia,Hewitson,20.0,91.0,"The cuttings for this vineyard were taken from the Old Garden Vineyard, so despite it's relatively young age, it has pedigree. Sage, smoke and black olive notes mingle easily on the nose, backed by flavors of vanilla, black cherry and mocha. It's medium to full in body and creamy in texture, with a smooth, silky finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,R&A; Pfaffl,20.0,91.0,"A hint of passion fruit mingles with yeasty tones in this wine's aroma. The palate doles out savory, sage-like notes in a concentrated, textural frame. It finishes with a lemony, lip-smacking and refreshing fillip."
Gros Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine du Tariquet,20.0,91.0,"For this medium-sweet wine, the Grassa family has chosen one of the Southwest's great grape varieties. The Gros Manseng easily makes this style: fruity and with a fine balance between sweetness and crisp acidity. This is a young wine, named after the singing thrush (grive) in the vines. It's still developing and will be better from 2018."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Soléna,20.0,91.0,"As classy a bottle as you might expect from veteran winemaker Laurent Montalieu. Once again the fruit is crystal clear, setting up fresh pear, green apple and pink grapefruit flavors against crisp, juicy acidity. The finish is lively and spicy."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Amity Vineyards,20.0,91.0,"Powerful scents mix dried herb, wet grass and petrol—it could be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc in a blind tasting, and it has that much density and extract. The label says dry, and it is certainly that, much in the Australian style. Big, concentrated, high acid and quite cellarworthy."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Lamadrid,20.0,91.0,"Black cherry, dark plum and charred rubber give this a masculine opening. Generous and layered across the palate, this tastes of blackberry, chocolaty oak and spice. A lasting, tannic finish is loaded with oak and baking-spice flavors. Drink this ripe, delicious bruiser through 2021."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Dão,Fontes da Cunha,20.0,91.0,This wood-aged wine is rich and smooth with light toast blending with the yellow fruit and spice. Acidity gives the wine its freshness contrasting with the complex fruit and wood balance. Drink this fine wine from 2017.
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Martín Berdugo,20.0,91.0,"After it oozes rubber and bacon on the nose, berry fruit and mild medicinal aromas settle in. Feels full, tight and structured, with meat, black cherry and wild berry flavors. Finishes warm, chocolaty and lightly roasted. Well-made, and impressive for the price."
Tokaji,Hungary,Tokaji,Royal Tokaji,20.0,91.0,"For $20, this bargain basement Tokaji is pretty unbelievable. Abundantly floral and honeyed on the nose, it's deeply concentrated on the palate, with layers of luscious figs and peaches, accented by lanolin and beeswax. Creamy and unctuous on the tongue, yet clean and fresh on the finish, with orange-inflected acidity that lingers."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Château d'Aqueria,20.0,91.0,"Full-bodied, rich and slightly warm, this assertive Tavel boasts notes of raspberry, peach and melon. It's a bold, fruit-driven style that brightens on the finish, where crisp acids and a chalky feel add texture."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Elgin,Neil Ellis,20.0,91.0,"While Neil Ellis's winery is in Stellenbosch, he gets his Chardonnay for this wine from the cooler region of Elgin. It has sweet, almost tropical-fruit aromas, followed through with spicy, creamy, wood flavors and ripe, generous acidity. Despite its richness, it also has delicacy, as much in the finely judged use of wood as in the clean, elegant fruit."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de la Pepière,20.0,91.0,"The light-gold color of this wine shows its maturity. It's a rich wine that is rounded, full and with a touch of honey. With its toasty character and full-bodied character, this is an impressive wine for drinking now."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Cono Sur,20.0,91.0,"Striking and sincere Sauvignon Blanc. One whiff, one taste and one swish across the palate and you'll know that this is elevated stuff. For starters, the bouquet delivers honest bell pepper, melon, passion fruit and apple aromas; and along with the fruit there's nuance, structure and balancing herbal notes. Full, long and regal. Drink now to capture this wine's powerful essence."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Efeste,20.0,91.0,"This thoroughly delicious, acid-driven wine opens with aromas of passion fruit, oyster shell, herbs, wet stone and citrus. The flavors are sleek yet generous with electric, mouthwatering acidity. It demands oysters alongside it."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Muruve,20.0,91.0,"Meaty and full-bodied, with molasses, roasted blackberry and cola aromas. This is a fine example of affordable Toro; it's rich and balanced, not overripe or raisiny, with tannic grip, a chewy texture and lasting flavors of prune, blackberry and chocolate. Drink now through 2013."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Longplay,20.0,91.0,"Strongly flavored by the barrel fermentation and extended lees contact, this rich and textural Chardonnay opens with toasted coconut, banana cream pie, pear tart and other pastry-like delights. It is not fruit-deficient, however, and there is plenty of snappy acidity under all the goodies."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Landmark,20.0,91.0,"Sourced from the Hop Kiln Vineyard on Westside Road, this crisp, creamy white is seductive and balanced, a refreshing sip of white peach and almond. Aromatic in honeysuckle and orange blossom, it leaves a suggestion of exotic spice on the finish."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Penfolds,20.0,91.0,"Better known for its red wines, Penfolds has turned out a lovely Bin 51 Riesling in 2007. An alluring nose of orange sherbet and petrol leads into a medium-weight wine that manages to be both broad and mouthcoating and yet long and racy on the finish. May not be a long-lived Riesling by Aussie standards, but it should still drink well over the next 7-10 years."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Gunter Triebaumer,20.0,91.0,"A touch of roasted coffee clings to the nose, otherwise it wants to give little away. The taut palate barely shows the dark fruit, so tight is it with a fine-grained tannin structure. This is dense and sumptuous, but has ample freshness as a counterweight. It still needs to mellow and show its fruit. Drink 2018–2025."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Oregon,Quady North,20.0,91.0,"Close to half Viognier, this is cofermented with Roussanne and Marsanne, then blended with 7% Grenache Blanc. A small portion of the Viognier was fermented in Acacia oak. Deep and rich flavors are packed with sliced pear, then range on through oranges and mixed citrus, adding a touch of vanilla in a fresh tangy lingering finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ghost Pines,20.0,91.0,"A bright, focused fruitiness is the strength of this full-bodied, very ripe and enticing wine. It smells and tastes like fresh strawberries, raspberries and cherries, and feels ultrasmooth and polished in texture. With each sip a better sense of depth and concentration builds."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Real Companhia Velha,20.0,91.0,"Perfumed wine, with plum fruits, toast and a sweet, rich texture. It is dense, deep flavored, the fruit and tannins going right into the firm structure. Give this concentrated, bold wine at least 4–5 years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beiras,Quinta de Foz de Arouce,20.0,91.0,"Dark-colored wine, a blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional, both of which lend their tannins to this still-young wine. It is dense with a firm, dry presence. The fruit is textured, structured, focused on weight and aging potential."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaji,Disznókö,20.0,91.0,"Bartlett pear and freshly squeezed lime juice carry the nose, while flavors of green apple, pear and lime rind drive the crisp, elegant palate. The finish shows nuance, with a slightly astringent mouthfeel."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Duorum,20.0,91.0,"Richly structured and ripe, this has black tannins laced with dark plum fruit. Its tannins promise aging while its fruit already offers a rounded taste. Keep for 3–4 years."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Perdriel,20.0,91.0,"This is a cuddly, jammy, ripe Malbec with maple, blackberry and oak aromas. It feels weighty and lush, with large-scale boysenberry, blackberry and blueberry flavors. It turns a little soft and basic on the finish, but there's no griping about this wine's purity and fruit content."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Bestheim,20.0,91.0,"There is something lifted on the nose that translates as white currant and dried lemon peel on the palate. A distinct notion of autolysis provides a canvas for the fruity but restrained lemon notes. The fine mousse supports this beautiful balance, while the dry finish shines with lasting lemon flavors."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Albino Armani,20.0,91.0,"Yeasty aromas of bread dough, toasted hazelnut, pressed wild flower and an earthy whiff of brimstone follow over to the crisp palate along with citrus and yellow apple. Made with grapes cultivated according to biodynamic farming practices and fermented with wild yeasts, it's a fascinating expression of Prosecco."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Four Graces,20.0,91.0,"Plump tree fruits carry the weight, with a dash of toast—though the winery notes say the fermentation was 100% stainless steel. It's delicious and ready to drink, now through 2018."
Port,Portugal,Port,Royal Oporto,20.0,91.0,"The texture of this wine is dense and concentrated while keeping the fresh fruit and acidity well in balance. It has ripe blackberry flavors that offer great fruitiness. The firm background of tannin structure is balanced by a juicy, fruity aftertaste. Drink now."
Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Boeckel,20.0,91.0,"Perfumed, red-cheeked apple and freshly baked bread unite into an enticing nose where fruit and autolysis are perfectly fused. The palate follows suit, with the fruit speaking more loudly, leading to an inviting and zesty autolytic finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,20.0,91.0,"Rich and full in the mouth, this still-young wine also has a good structure. It is dark and dense, smoky over the red-berry fruits. Concentrated fruit and tannins give a solid base for the wine's ripe, aromatic character. Drink from 2017."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Rimauresq,20.0,91.0,"This ripe, lively wine is bursting with red fruits. Crisp and clean, it features a light mineral character that gives it tight texture balanced by refreshing raspberry and orange flavors. The aftertaste shines with crisp acidity."
Syrah,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,20.0,91.0,"Stillwater Creek, Conner Lee and Bacchus vineyards provided the fruit for this young, sappy and rich Syrah. It captures the varietal character of the grape, especially as expressed in Washington State. Inviting aromas of berries and chocolate, bright and fresh, lead into brambly red fruits, umami-soaked mushrooms and moist earth."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Bel Air,20.0,91.0,"Jean-Marc Lafont's 16-acre Les Charmes vineyard is on granite soil in the west of the cru appellation. The wine is firm and concentrated with serious tannins as well as perfumed juicy black fruits. With its tannins, it is a wine to age. Drink from 2018."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine les Fines Graves,20.0,91.0,This cru wine is still young and firm. It has great tannins and a dense character that will give a rich generous wine as it matures. Black-cherry fruit dominates along with the structure. It is a solid wine that will be ready to drink from 2018.
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Pflüger,20.0,91.0,"Dark tones of smoke and slate persist from nose to finish in this dry, intensely mineral Riesling. Its silky, supple palate suggests a ripeness of fruit off set by puckery lemon-lime acidity."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,20.0,91.0,"The Chardonnay in this blend was fermented and aged in wood and then combined with crisp Arinto fermented in tank. The result is a lightly oaked wine that has yellow fruits as well as crisper citrus. It is a finely made, ripe wine that will be ready to drink from the end of 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Sogrape,20.0,91.0,"From Sogrape's newly launched venture in Alentejo, this is a ripe, tannic wine. It has a strongly perfumed character from the Syrah and Touriga Nacional in the blend. In the background, dry tannins offer aging potential. Drink this finely balanced wine from 2017."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Dumas,20.0,91.0,"Now prizes for guessing C de B stands for Côte de Brouilly. Now perfectly mature, this is a soft, black cherry fruited wine. It is ripe, with a fine, dense texture that is lifted by the acidity and the light tannic structure. The wine is so deliciously ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Soléna,20.0,91.0,"Winemaker Laurent Montalieu really shines with Pinot Gris, and the vibrant nose and lush textures of his 2006 Soléna continue an unbroken string of successes. Packed with fresh pear fruit, annotated with pineapple and laced with vanilla, this delicious wine keeps resonating through the palate and into a lively, spicy finish. No malolactic fermentation, no oak. Just a lovely expression of great fruit."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Andrew Rich,20.0,91.0,"This classic Washington blend is 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Syrah—a perfect storm of power, precision and compact fruit. From the Merlot comes a thickly generous layer of strawberry/black cherry fruit. The Franc beefs up the tannins and adds highlights of coffee grounds, while the Syrah lifts the wine's aromatics and lightly spices it with pepper. Masterful blending by Andrew Rich."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Lagarde,20.0,91.0,"Nice and pure, with controlled berry aromas, a dash of pepper and integrated background oak. A tasty, easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth, length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Landat,20.0,91.0,"There is a fine mineral texture to this structured, firm wine from the northern Haut-Médoc. It also has ripe fruit and a richly tannic character, with flavors of black plum juice and berry. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, this will age over several years."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Dopff Au Moulin,20.0,91.0,"A lovely touch of lemon sponge cake appears on the nose. The palate also plays up to this by uniting notes of sprightly lemon and fresh pastry on the palate. This is light and bright, fresh and creamy with lively mousse. The finish is dry and wonderfully refreshing with lasting lemon notes."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Calstar Cellars,20.0,91.0,"Tart in lemon peel and tangerine, this lively white also offers a magnitude of stony minerality that manifests as a gravelly complexion on the texture. Honeysuckle figures prominently on the nose."
Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Pierre Henri Morel,20.0,91.0,"Pierre Henri Morel is Chapoutier's general manager, but he also has his own line of wines that can often represent excellent value. This blend of Grenache, Clairette and Bourboulenc is full bodied and rich, toasty and smoky with oak influence and well endowed with peach and pineapple fruit. Drink it over the next year."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Plantagenet,20.0,91.0,"A step up from the winery's entry-level Hazard Hill bottling, the 2008 Omrah Shiraz is another terrific value. It takes plummy fruit and cedary oak, then ups the ante with complex notes of smoked meat and leather while silky tannins line the long finish. Drink now–2020."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Soléna,20.0,91.0,"Zippy and fruity, bursting with bright, palate-cleansing grapefruit and citrus, this excellent effort is further bolstered by bracing minerality and a barely perceptible hint of sweetness. All in all a thrilling ride on the Oregon Pinot Gris roller coaster."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château K,20.0,91.0,"A powerful smoky, wood-aged Bordeaux blend. It is dominated by the tense black-currant flavor of Cabernet Sauvignon, giving a structured and elegant wine that remains rich. It will certainly age for over 4–5 years or more."
Syrah,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,Rios de Chile,20.0,91.0,"Opens with sensational aromas that span plum, berry and chocolate. Feels compact yet juicy, with a lot of depth and purity. Wild berry, mint and bacon-like flavors work the palate, while the finish is defined by tannins, woody spice and natural body. A smooth bruiser to enjoy with venison or steak."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Lannac Saint-Jean,20.0,91.0,"Young and purple colored, with elegant mint and polished black fruit flavors. The wine has a fine structure, never too heavy, but remains rich and dense. It's so smooth that it could be consumed now, but three more years of aging will do it well."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,DFJ Vinhos,20.0,91.0,"This is a powerfully structured wine, not heavy but firm, with tannins and tensile acidity. The dry core of the wine supports blueberry and violet flavors concentrated on the palate. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Nauerth-Gnägy,20.0,91.0,"Fresh herb and lime notes brighten this smoky, intensely mineral Riesling. While dry and quite sprightly in style, it has a lush, silky mouthfeel that adds a perception of weight and expansiveness. Drink now through 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Robert Hall,20.0,91.0,"Fudge, smoked blackberries and a shred of asphalt show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime Paso producer. The density is seriously thick but not overblown, with brighter cherry and fresh blueberry fruit elements that lean against a tannic edge, flecked with black pepper and espresso bean."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Baron De Ley,20.0,91.0,"The high quality of the 2010 harvest is on display here. Enchanting aromas of mocha, toast and black fruits are complex and crafty. This feels fresh, with a hint of tannic scratch. Flavors of spiced cherry, currant and mocha finish with tobacco notes. Given that 100,000 cases of this Reserva were made, the end result is impressive. Drink through 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Sogrape,20.0,91.0,"This is a rich finely structured wine from Sogrape's Alentejo estate which is located close to the best place in Europe to stargaze. Powered with tannins as well as black fruits, this blend of Syrah, Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional is dense and very ageworthy. Drink starting from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,20.0,91.0,"Ripe notions of yellow Mirabelle plum make for a friendly, inviting opening. Lemony freshness persists on the palate where it is joined by spicy white pepper and a savory, salty undertone of yeast. This is refreshing, light and moreish."
Spätburgunder,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,20.0,91.0,"While intensely youthful on the nose with aromas of fresh red cherries and blossom, the wine seems to build in depth and maturity on the palate. Fresh red fruit turns deeper and darker, and pretty floral notes pick up hints of potpourri and fall foliage. Elegant yet seductive, it is delicious now, but should mature beautifully through 2019–2021."
Roussanne,US,Washington,Barnard Griffin,20.0,91.0,"All Roussanne from the Gunkel vineyard, this is a fine expression of pure varietal fruit. A fresh and delicious blend of flavors, it touches on peach, apricot, lemon curd and pineapple, with impressive concentration through a long, clean finish."
Riesling,US,New York,Boundary Breaks,20.0,91.0,"Whiffs of herbs and green florals persist from start to finish on this elegant off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush with ripe white-peach flavor, but blossomy and bright with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long with a delicately lacy sweetness."
Riesling,US,New York,Red Newt Cellars,20.0,91.0,"Perfumed and elegant, this wine is a highlight within the producer's line up of consistently well-made wines. Waxy honeycomb and floral aromas accent fresh green notes on this off-dry Riesling. It's lean in style, yet plush with sweet white peach and melon flavors. Finishes long with a lingering spray of honeysuckle."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Saint Andrieu,20.0,91.0,"From a property owned by the Bignon-Cordier family of Château Talbot in Saint-Julien in Bordeaux, this wine is packed with red fruit. Smooth and full bodied, it offers a touch of spice as well as perfumed raspberry acidity. A rich wine, it is ready to drink."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaines Bunan,20.0,91.0,"Made with 25% Mourvèdre, this blend benefits from that grape's intense perfume and structure. It is rich with red fruits and tannins, both of which suggest a wine that could age a few months. It is full bodied and does need food to be fully appreciated. Drink at its best at the end of 2016."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tascante,20.0,91.0,"Made entirely from Nerello Mascalese, this vibrant wine opens with blue flower, red-skinned berry and thyme aromas. The fresh, juicy palate delivers red cherry, strawberry, cinnamon and licorice flavors framed by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2023."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Portuguese Table Wine,Adega Mãe,20.0,91.0,"Anselmo Mendes from granite Vinho Verde and Diogo Lopes from clay-soil Lisboa brought together the fruit of their harvests to make one limited-edition Alvarinho wine. The result: a ripe, warm and creamy character with wonderful fresh acidity. Drink this refreshing, ripe wine now."
Carmenère,Chile,Rapel Valley,Santa Carolina,20.0,91.0,"This is dark and pointed on the nose, with graphite, mint, peppercorn and creamy oak aromas supporting herbal berry fruit scents. The palate feels lush and almost airy, with soft tannins and baked black-fruit flavors accented by chocolate and coffee. An earthy finish with licorice and mild tannins says drink this Carmenère now through 2015."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Harper Voit,20.0,91.0,"This conveys creamy richness while seeming almost weightless. The color of bright straw-gold, it's crisply defined, with citrus flesh and rind, melon and lemon verbena highlights."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,J. Portugal Ramos,20.0,91.0,"With a part of this wine fermented in wood, it is rich and toasty yet still fruity at this stage. The layers of spice go with the ripe, creamy fruit and the mineral, tight texture. All these elements suggest successful aging, so this will be best drunk from 2017."
Rosé,US,California,Zaca Mesa,20.0,91.0,"This winery has been making rosé for more than two decades, and nails the recipe especially well this vintage. The brilliant salmon-pink wine shows watermelon, light red cherry and a stony quality on the nose, while the grippy palate engages from the get-go with red plum, riverstone and gravel on the tip of the sip. Strawberry flavors carry through the strong acidity, and the finish is all about texture."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de la Mordorée,20.0,91.0,"This blend of 50% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 20% Cinsault shows the same attention to quality as the Domaine's other bottlings. Ripe red berries, dried spices and crushed stone all mingle easily on the bright nose and round palate, finishing long and intense. Drink now."
Pinotage,South Africa,Wellington,Diemersfontein,20.0,91.0,"The label reads “The Original coffee/chocolate Pinotage” and boy are they right! This is pure decadent bliss with intense aromas of crème de cacao, raspberry chocolate sauce and coffee granules along with hints of hickory bacon and tobacco. The mouth is huge, ripe and full, with a balanced structure and gorgeous flavors of juicy mashed black raspberries, plum flesh, sweet smoked meat and mocha that leads strongly throughout the lengthy finish. With 500 cases imported, this is a Pinotage worth searching out and trying."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Scharffenberger,20.0,91.0,"Beautifully balanced between maturity and freshness, this elegant bubbly combines appetizing cherry, almond and ginger flavors with a suave texture and long finish. It achieves a level of personality and sophistication beyond simple fruitiness."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bread & Butter,20.0,91.0,"This very affordable wine from the Gregory Ahn portfolio begins with clean notes of blackberry juice, black iced tea and graphite. It's spicy, bright and juicy once sipped, proving very refreshing, and a great example of the stripped-down wine everyone talks about making."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Osborne,20.0,91.0,"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Mönchhof,20.0,91.0,"A good value among spätlesen, Mönchhof's 2005 Mosel Slate avoids the superripeness of the vintage, instead staying true to type. Hints of kerosene give a slate-like impression, layered over crisp lime and apple flavors. It's lithe and sinuous, ending crisp and racy."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Robert Oatley,20.0,91.0,"At the suggested retail price, this constitutes a fine value. It's rich and full in body, but balanced, with “tangerine dream” notes of ripe citrus backed by hints of peach and vanilla. Plush and mouthwatering on the finish, it should drink well through at least 2018."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Trenel Fils,20.0,91.0,"Even though this wine is structured, it's as much about fruit as tannins. Rich, juicy red-fruit flavors are lifted by acidity. The structure is in support, with a dry core that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2017."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Yohan Lardy,20.0,91.0,"This structured, firm wine brings out tannins as well as rich fruits. Concentrated raspberry and ripe cherry flavors are cut with a fine balance of acidity. From a single vineyard, the wine needs some age, so drink from 2017."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Dão,Fontes da Cunha,20.0,91.0,"A blend of Encruzado and Gouveio, this soft, young and fruity wine will be fine and ripe by 2016. The palate integrates a mineral texture and fresh citrus flavors that are tight and need to round out. It's a finely structured wine that finishes with a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from the end of 2016."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Boeckel,20.0,91.0,"Strawberry hints and floral overtones promise pleasure that arrives on the dry, creamy palate. A lively froth accentuates lightness and ease, while dryness underlines the clean fruit flavors. Fine autolysis provides the creamy, textured background, all pervaded by a lively seam of bright acid."
Red Blend,US,California,Andis,20.0,91.0,"This wine pulls it all together for a full-bodied, full-flavored and well-balanced taste experience. It smells like fresh-cut oak in a good way, tastes ripe and fruity, yet at the same time is somewhat tart and dry like cranberry juice. It's rich, well made and could even improve through 2020."
Primitivo,US,Washington,Casa Smith,20.0,91.0,"This variety is a niche player in the state but this wine shows its promise. Aromas of cigar box, mineral, herb and red fruit are followed by a plush full fruit palate. It brings unabashed appeal."
Zinfandel,US,California,Peachy Canyon,20.0,91.0,"This well-priced wine shows deep aromas of blackcurrant and kirsch bolstered by soft cola, clove and sassafras notes. The palate is framed by a rocky, volcanic minerality and seductive structure that unveils vanilla, minty herbs and rich rhubarb."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Eradus,20.0,91.0,"Much like the 2006, this is an excellent effort, combining ripe melon and fig flavors with leafy notes of fresh garden herbs and crisp citrus. It's a touch viscous on the palate, finishing with superb length and freshness. Drink now."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Inkwell,20.0,91.0,"The 2005 Inkwell wines are undeniably big, but they manage to carry their weight and ample alcohol levels with a surprising measure of balance and grace. This one clocks in at 15.7%, but doesn't seem hot or heavy, just mouthfilling and round. Blueberry and blackberry fruit lead the way, but they're joined by earthier notes of black olive, coffee and tree bark. Drink now–2010."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,20.0,91.0,"Whiffs of caramelized sugar and smoked nuts accent aromas of ripe, concentrated peaches and nectarines on this intensely juicy semi-sweet Riesling. It's fruitiness makes it unabashedly approachable, but it's stately in feel with bold mineral and smoky earth tones that linger on the finish."
Baga,Portugal,Bairrada,Vadio Wines,20.0,91.0,"Luis Patrão started the organic Vadio Project in 2005 to preserve the native Baga grape grown nine miles from the Atlantic Ocean. This vintage, spectacular throughout Portugal, is a ripe, jammy, fruity wine, with typically firm tannins from the Baga grape. The red plum and rich berry flavors at the core are cut by ample acidity. It is already soft enough to drink now, although it will be better from 2016."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,3 Rings,20.0,91.0,"Lush and creamy in texture, this shows just how good some relatively inexpensive Barossa Shiraz can be. Elements of graham cracker, espresso, dark chocolate and baking spices are bolstered by ample weight and berry fruit. Enjoy this velvety wine over the short term—by 2018 or so."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Quinta de Soalheiro,20.0,91.0,"From the northern Vinho Verde region of Monçao and Melgaço, this finely textured wine is young, although already delicious. Its texture brings out the minerality from the granite soil, giving the wine a zesty character. The fruit bursts out of the glass: delicious citrus and sliced apples and a great burst of acidity. Drink from late 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Matetic,20.0,91.0,"Strikingly pungent on first take, with crackling aromas of cactus, nettle, lime and grapefruit. Feels zesty, deep and layered, with an even mix of tropical fruit flavors, stone fruits and green notes. About as right as it gets for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Branco,20.0,91.0,"Finely structured, this full-bodied wine is packed with black-fruit and plum flavors, with intense notes of spice and toast. With its solid foundation of powerful tannins, this is a wine for aging over 3–4 years."
Nasco,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Argiolas,20.0,91.0,"Made with the native Nasco grape, which is usually reserved to make sweet dessert wines, this dry, full-bodied white opens with an attractive floral fragrance of Spanish broom, chamomile and a whiff of tropical fruit. The rich, creamy palate delivers ripe yellow apple, apricot and candied ginger while a note of toasted almond closes the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Concannon,20.0,91.0,"This is a strong wine for the price, unfolding with caramelized berries, kirsch, black cassis, wet river stone and tight plum skins on the dense nose. Cooked blackberries and black-cherry jam show on the palate, where elegant graphite tannins make for a very silky, earthy wine."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Panache Cellars,20.0,91.0,"This tiny Oregon winery sourced Yakima Valley fruit for this wine. Though many West Coast producers take a stab at this Italian grape, most settle for a faux “Super Tuscan,” highly oaked style. This is closer to Chianti Classico, with strawberry and cherry fruit, good acidity and light herbal highlights."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Companhia das Quintas,20.0,91.0,"From a group of estates that has properties in the Douro, Lisboa and Beira, this wine is finely structured and richly textured. It has layers of tannins supporting its dense berry fruit. With its juicy acidity and black currant flavor, it's likely to age further. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Robertson,De Wetshof,20.0,91.0,"A hint of buttered popcorn sits atop scents of ripe yellow apple, peach and lemon custard on the nose of this wine. Those notes continue through to the plush palate, with threads of toasted brioche and sweet spice weaving throughout. There's ample acidic cut to the mouthfeel, lending balance and freshness that lasts through the finish. Drink now–2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Maçanita Vinhos,20.0,91.0,"With 50% new oak aging, this is a rich and spicy wine that also has layers of dense toastiness. Black currants and blackberries come together with the structure and fine acidity to give a rich, concentrated wine that should still age further. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Presqu'ile,20.0,91.0,"This is a stunner because it shows such minerally depth, which many strive for but few achieve on a pink wine. The classic shade of pink gives way to bubblegum, lime juice, orange rind and smashed raspberry aromas. The zesty, vibrant lime juice acidity cuts right through plum fruit, but it's the graphite and chalky tension that wins the palate."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,St. Innocent,20.0,91.0,"Theoretically a very light rosé, the “Eye of the Partridge” is really a Pinot Noir blanc in this vintage, and joins a growing cohort of such wines from Oregon. Strong acids compete with some residual sugar, in a tart and sappy wine chock full of yellow plum, white raspberries and citrus fruit. It's rich and delicious, with impressive length and concentration."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Côtes Rémont,20.0,91.0,"This is a spicy wine, finely fruity with black-currant fruits and with some firm structured tannins. It is a concentrated wine that is likely to mature slowly. There is a sense of power behind this fine cru wine. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Replica,20.0,91.0,"This wine is subtle in aroma but extremely generous in texture. It seems to start out slow and then floods the palate with very ripe but not sweet flavors like kiwi, pear and honeydew melon on a nicely viscous, pillowy texture."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Gérard Bertrand,20.0,91.0,"This is an immediately attractive and approachable wine, with direct and intense aromas and flavors of black cherry, plum and boysenberry accented by notes of sweet smoke, mocha and pepper. Firm yet approachable, this is well-balanced with structured tannins and ample acidity. Drink from 2015-2018."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Le Pupille,20.0,91.0,"This outstanding Morellino di Scansano has a lovely fragrance of violet, berry and spice. The bright and delicious palate delivers a tight core of black cherry along with white pepper notes and hints of white chocolate and coffee. It has impeccable balance and finesse."
Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,20.0,91.0,"Gentle notes of red apples play above a balanced, concentrated but sprightly palate: zesty acidity brightens everything and counters the textured weight. Despite being rich, this is very appetizing and makes you long for more."
Roussanne,US,California,Mensch,20.0,91.0,"Rich, ripe pear and peach flavors light up this full-bodied and creamy-textured wine. The fruit flavors are gorgeous and expressive, and they come with an appetizing layer of subtle acidity to balance out the full mouthfeel."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Tinhof,20.0,91.0,"Fresh notes of ripe red and black cherry abound on nose and palate. This wine is juicy and bright, drawing on ample fruit that dances on the palate. The tannins are fine and have only the slightest grip, giving backbone to all this exuberance. Freshness brightens the flavors and gives tension to the sleek body. This juicy, utterly cherry-ish red will also work slightly chilled."
Red Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Arndorfer,20.0,91.0,"A mere suspicion of black cherry can be discerned on the nose of this Zweigelt-Pinot Noir blend. On the palate, ripe but tart cherry fruit is on full display, made precise by ample freshness. It conveys a touch of white pepper amid soft, pliable tannins, with an edge of crunchy freshness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,20.0,91.0,"Aromas of black cherry, roasted red pepper and leather prepare the palate for flavors of black cherry, black fig, cherry preserves, anise and orange peel. A network of velvety tannins provides a backdrop for an ongoing cool-mint sensation that drops away for final notes of anisette and orange peel."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Viña Cobos,20.0,91.0,"Potent Malbec with aromas of leather, bacon, blackberry and smoke. It's thick and dense, but well balanced, with flavors of blackberry, cola, pepper and nutmeg. More smooth and easy than complex, with a long, creamy, sweet finish that cements the wine's character. Probably the best Felino Malbec to date, and a good value at 20 bucks."
White Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Arndorfer,20.0,91.0,"A touch of flinty reduction still hovers abovde enticing savory and herbal notes of chervil, yeast and white pepper. These are given direction and drive on the spritzy, lively palate by brisk, crisp and fresh acidity. This unusual pairing of Grüner Veltliner and Riesling unites the savory and invigorating nature of both grapes to create liveliness. It's intersting and irresistible."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,20.0,91.0,"A velvety texture and extremely concentrated black-fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine delicious to savor. It has beautiful big tannins that are well integrated, luxurious blackberry, sage and cedar flavors, plus great length on the finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Soléna,20.0,91.0,"Soléna really ups their PG game with this latest vintage, a super rich, succulent effort that is packed to the core with fresh pear fruit flavors. Light touches of cinnamon, and a sense of sweetness from ripe fruit, not residual sugar, keep the flavors expanding through a lush and creamy finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,La Follette,20.0,91.0,"Complex fruit flavors that are focused and intricate bring a lot of life to this medium-bodied, lively and intriguing wine. There are touches of ripe apple, honey, mango and an underlying light layer of vanilla and cream, all supported by fresh acidity and a smooth but slightly tangy texture."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Birot,20.0,91.0,This concentrated wine is solid with tannins. The fruit is evident from the fine acidity and hints of black plum that push through the wall of tannin. Give it time and drink from 2021.
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,20.0,91.0,"Named after the 18th Century Russian tsar, Peter the Great, this wine is tannic and structured, with a fine balance of black fruit. The Merlot in the blend, which softens the Malbec, has also added a strongly rich and fruity character. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château les Petits Arnauds,20.0,91.0,"Although full of fruit, this no-sulfur-added wine is structured and concentrated. Big tannins back up the ripe character and generous fruit flavors. It's likely to be ready to drink from 2021."
Zinfandel,US,California,Andis,20.0,91.0,"Hints of damp earth and new leather lend a distinctive taste profile to this full-bodied, ripe and broad-textured wine. Boosted by baking spices, toasted baguette and dried plum notes, the wine gets more complex with time in the glass."
Syrah,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Kingston Family,20.0,91.0,"Ripe, earthy black-fruit aromas are spicy and a bit lactic from oak, hence, the palate is full and creamy, but with a good acidic cut. Blackberry, herbal spice and cool toasty oak flavors finish warm and plump."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,20.0,91.0,"This is a rich Riesling, with soft apple and creamed-pear flavor as well as perfumed notes of white flower and white currant. The wine has a dense texture, giving both concentration and a mineral core. Screwcap."
Riesling,US,Washington,Efeste,20.0,91.0,"The aromas of ripe peach, jasmine, honeysuckle and mineral pop. It drinks just off dry, with a spritz of stone-fruit and citrus flavors that extend on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Gorman,20.0,91.0,"The aromas are redolent with notes of candy corn, peach and spice. The palate is full bodied and rich, with a layered creamy feel to the stone-fruit flavors. It shows some warmth on the finish."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Brooks,20.0,91.0,"This substantial effort brings plump melon, orange and peach flavors into focus. It fills out substantially as it works across the palate with a sprinkling of bee pollen, then turns a corner and shows the petrol character of the grape, suggesting that further bottle age will yield rewarding results."
Syrah,US,California,Robert Hall,20.0,91.0,"Roasted beef and bacon fat scents meet with maple, char, Concord grape and blueberry on the nose of this hearty bottling from a winery recently acquired by O'Neill Vintners. Its tannins are deep and firm but welcoming, providing the framework for black currant, blueberry, charred beef and rosemary flavors."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Gruber Röschitz,20.0,91.0,"Overtones of candied lemon peel steal into the more general fresh zestiness here, hinting at aromatic richness and purity. The palpable, zesty midpalate highlights the citrus qualities even more. Verve and freshness in a glass."
Red Blend,Canada,British Columbia,Cellar Hand,20.0,91.0,"Principally Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this dark and smoky wine from Black Hills Estate Winery brings exceptional complexity to a more budget-friendly blend. Generous streaks of soy, espresso, dark chocolate and smoke wrap around a cassis core. The roasted black fruits and continuing flavors of smoke, tar and tobacco create a wine with power and length."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Tenute del Cerro,20.0,91.0,"A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Mammolo, this offers classic varietal scents of underbrush, wild berry, blue flower and a whiff of leather. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and anise framed in tightly packed but mature tannins. Drink through 2020."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Robert Weil,20.0,91.0,"Whiffs of white peach and yellow cherry intensify on the palate of this punchy, concentrated dry Riesling. It's buoyantly juicy and fruity, full of fresh stone fruit and citrus flavors. Vibrant acidity and deep veins of crushed slate lend refreshment to a long finish. It's an exceptionally balanced wine at a bargain price."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Colinas do Douro,20.0,91.0,"Produced from old vines, this blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz is rich and dense. It has firm tannins at this young stage although it is obviously going to become a generous rich wine as it develops. It has a fine future of complex structure and fruit. Drink from 2019."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Pichot,20.0,91.0,"This dry wine shows hints of honey as well as pure sliced apple and white stone fruits. It is deliciously crisp, bright with acidity, almonds and a tangy texture. The wine is totally ready to drink in its fruity youth."
Barbera,US,Washington,Casa Smith,20.0,91.0,"This is the inaugural release of this wine. It shows aromas of dried herbs, plums and currants that lead to a full-bodied and full-flavored palate. It's a mouthful of juicy fruit flavors that delights the senses, with the feel simply dazzling."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Kingston Family,20.0,91.0,"One of Chile's go-to producers of Sauvignon Blanc has bottled a winner. This deals classic aromas of citrus, nettle and sea brine. The palate is slightly oily and creamy, but lively with acidity. Flavors of persimmon, melon and ocean brine finish slightly salty, with a fresh-meets-oily feel."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Famaey,20.0,91.0,"The oak aging, implicit in the name of the wine, is present in its smooth character. This bottling is in the elegant style typical of Famaey wines and also has weight and firm, concentrated black fruit with acidity and a dry core. Drink from 2019."
Riesling,US,California,Gustafson Family,20.0,91.0,"Light bodied and highly aromatic in petrol, waxy apple and pear, this vineyard-designate is crisp and floral, with buoyant acidity. It lists the residual sugar at 9 g/L but tastes more dry than sweet, finishing with a touch of cream."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Angel Vine,20.0,91.0,"Among the four vineyards used by Angel Vine, the Avery stands apart for its detail, grip and length. Blue fruits take center stage—plums and berries—along with a tasty lick of coffee and chocolate. You may pick up a hint of the tack room and a streak of fennel in the finish."
Primitivo,US,Washington,Angel Vine,20.0,91.0,"Primitivo is a close relation to Zinfandel, and it slides easily into the Angel Vine lineup which includes four other Zins. This carries a touch more earthiness than the others, with darker fruits and a distinctive streak of espresso. Good grip and density mark this as the most muscular wine among the 2011's."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ottimino Vineyards,20.0,91.0,"From a selection of its best vineyards across the county, this producer showcases a majority of the variety with 16% Petite Sirah, all aged in French oak, 25% of it new. Black olive, spicy leather and cinnamon make for a bold, dry and boisterous wine that's entirely enjoyable, integrated in terms of both tannin and oak."
Red Blend,US,California,Marietta Cellars,20.0,91.0,"Dark, dense, rich and spicy, this Rhône-style blend is impressively delicious. Full bodied, it's saturated with blackberry, cinnamon and black-pepper flavors supported by fine-grained tannins. While it packs a punch, it is well balanced for a big, assertive wine, and will be best after 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Market Vineyards,20.0,91.0,"This wine is predominantly Merlot (44%) along with a whopping 33% Petit Verdot, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Aromas of cocoa, vanilla, spice, green herbs and dark fruit are followed by generous dark-fruit flavors and plentiful tannins. It shows good cellaring potential."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Once and It's Gone,20.0,91.0,"This affordable wine impresses in smoky, charred oak and a full, robust profile that it embraces completely. Leather, blackberry and black pepper combine on the palate for power and a lengthy, lasting impression on the finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Turkovich,20.0,91.0,"Rich and almost meaty, this Rhône-style wine has wonderful complexity in aroma and flavor. It smells lightly earthy and very berry-like, tastes a bit smoky and beefy along with generous blackberry flavors that linger on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,20.0,91.0,"Powerfully structured and concentrated, this is a rich, tarry and tannic wine. The dense texture doesn't lose sight of the jammy black currant and berry fruits that are just underneath. For the moment, even after four years, the wine is very young, firm and dry. Drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,20.0,91.0,"The wine is ripe, still young with its fresh fruits and acidity. The elements are all there to produce a dark and dense wine that has fine structure. It's a complex blend of Alfrocheiro, Syrah and Touriga Nacional, all of which will allow the wine to age over a good few years. Drink this impressive wine from 2017."
Arinto,Portugal,Bucelas,Quinta da Romeira,20.0,91.0,"This pure Arinto from its home territory is fresh, fruity, citrus-driven and with apple and textured zesty orange flavors. The wine has structure, intense acidity and a tangy, mineral character that will allow it to mature a few more months. Drink now, but better from late 2016."
Baga,Portugal,Bairrada,Casca Wines,20.0,91.0,"Aged in barrel for 12 months, this is a rich wine. Supple tannins are integrated with the spice, toast and the black-currant fruit that are typical of the Baga grape. It is developing well, with its ripe fruits and crisp acidity at the end. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Greysac,20.0,91.0,"With 135 acres under vine, this is a large estate. The high percentage of Merlot in the blend gives this rich wine its ripe blackberry smoky fruits. It is juicy and really fruity with just enough tannin to give the wine shape. Drink this wine from 2020."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Thistle,20.0,91.0,"This estate-grown, organic Chardonnay is a terrific value, detailed and brightly fruity, with precise angles and spicy details. The apple/pear/pineapple fruit flavors are crisply defined, perfectly ripe, and beautifully balanced."
Grüner Veltliner,US,California,Zocker,20.0,91.0,"The nose on this bottling is immensely intriguing and unique, with gooseberry, grapefruit skin, wet river stone and the faintest whiff of serrano chili. It's as racy as it can be on the sip, as the bright, fresh and grippy texture reveals flavors of underripe white peach, lime and tons of wet stone."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Clos du Gaimont,20.0,91.0,"This is a dry wine, although still retaining those enticing honey flavors that are typical of Loire Chenin Blanc. Apple and ripe pear flavors are laced with intense acidity. Its delicate white-flower perfumes are ethereal. Drink now."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Pierre Henri Morel,20.0,91.0,"Morel, the general manager at M. Chapoutier, also has his own label, which includes this very attractive wine from Sign­argues, the southernmost villages appellation of the Côte du Rhône. It's full bodied and ripe without being flabby or unstructured, delivering blueberry and blackberry fruit, peppery spice and a long finish that reverberates with fruit and an espresso note."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Rulo,20.0,91.0,"Labeled “Stainless Cuvée,” this stainless-steel-aged Chardonnay is definitely European in style. A fine contrast to Rulo's toasty Walla Walla cuvée, this has minerally apple and citrus flavors. It's delicate but full flavored, with concentration and length."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Rosedale Wines,20.0,91.0,"A superb value, this wine's weighty presence and rich texture convey the warmth of the Barossa without ever stepping over into overripeness. Instead, it delivers mixed berry fruit, peppery spice and overtones of vanilla and chocolate. Drink now and over the next few years."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Rustenberg,20.0,91.0,"A stunning Chard that shows the greatness of the vintage in the wine's superb balance between ripe fruit flavors of pear and melon and vibrant acidity. Soft floral accents add depth to the nose, while well-integrated oak flavors infuse the palate and spice up the long finish. Delicious now, but shows promise for some aging."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,J. Portugal Ramos,20.0,91.0,"Mint aromas, followed by young, fresh fruit topped with firm tannins, make an impressively dense wine from one of Portugal's top winemakers. Flavors of mint and eucalyptus go with dark black fruits and concentration."
Pinot Meunier,US,California,Saint Gregory,20.0,91.0,"This is a highly unusual wine made from a traditional Champagne grape variety, with 12% of the South African Pinotage variety blended in. It Aromas like dried herbs and cedar, intriguing flavors like black tea and pomegranate juice and a beautiful balance between acidity, ripeness and a lightly tannic texture make a compelling combination."
Albariño,US,California,Hendry,20.0,91.0,"This 100% varietal wine, fermented and aged in stainless steel, is silky and creamy, with a medium body and texture that retains a sizzle of freshness on the palate. Well balanced, it offers melon, green apple and lemon, with a tease of fresh-cut peach, ending crisp and clean."
White Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Panizzi,20.0,91.0,"Fragrant and fresh, this opens with aromas of yellow field flowers, peaches, pineapple and citrus zest. The vibrant palate offers pear, lemon drop and lime alongside lively acidity. The clean, lingering finish closes on a white almond note."
Chardonnay,US,California,Perry Creek,20.0,91.0,"A creamy texture and apple pie flavors make this so rich it's almost a dessert. It is not actually sweet but has a full body and lush viscosity, presumably from barrel fermentation. It shows the shaping influence that barrels can have on heft and mouthfeel without adding heavy oak flavors per se. Delicious!"
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Cuarto Dominio,20.0,91.0,"This concentrated, midnight-black Malbec delivers the aromatic goods in the form of charcoal, grilled meat and blackberry scents. An extracted palate benefits from core acidity, while black cherry, cassis and blackberry flavors come to rest on a rich but controlled finish. Drink through 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,Australia,Western Australia,Cape Mentelle,20.0,91.0,"This is Cape Mentelle's biggest selling wine in the U.S., and one taste makes it clear why. It's got some of the herbal and passion fruit notes of Sauvignon Blanc, balanced by the strong citrus of Semillon. It's clean, crisp and long on the finish, with a lightly silky texture that lingers. Drink now."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,20.0,91.0,"This is pure Chardonnay, from cool-climate sites, showing a lean, sculpted spine that both defines and expands the flavors. Exceptionally complex for Washington Chardonnay, with good natural acidity, a mix of peach, apple and pineapple fruit, and a finish that shows tight layering. There is a dense core that should unravel with bottle age; this is that rare Washington Chardonnay that will prosper with cellaring."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Llopart,20.0,91.0,"Light in color with aromas of finely scented bath soap, strawberry, fresh cream and steel. The palate is a touch sweeter than you might expect, and that's because this is 60% Monastrell (Mourvèdre) along with Garnacha and Pinot Noir. Still, it's an elegant wine with punch bowl flavors."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Jim Barry,20.0,91.0,"The Lodge Hill Dry is a solid performer year-in and year-out. This vintage shows a hint of fuel oil alongside green apple, bergamot and clover notes. It's a fine, medium-bodied dry Riesling that broadens out just a little on the long finish."
Red Blend,Chile,Lolol Valley,François Lurton,20.0,91.0,"Woodsy, spicy aromas of herbal plum and berry come with a light coating of chocolate. A round, rubbery palate is tight in the long run. Saturated plum and blackberry flavors are oaky in front of an extracted finish that runs long and doesn't hold back. Drink through 2022."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Spy Valley,20.0,91.0,"This is a bit fuller and more textural than many Marlborough Sauvignons, which gives it an extra dimension. The aromas show just enough grassy punch to make them pop, while smooth grapefruit flavors build in intensity on the long finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lucas & Lewellen,20.0,91.0,"Taking off with a bright tangerine and lime nose, the citrus carries through to the palate, where grapefruit flavors take the varietal into curious yet compelling places. Acidity is at the forefront, thanks to the all-stainless-steel processing, but it feels strategically integrated."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,20.0,91.0,"One of the top Vouvray sparkling wines, this 2012 is still young. That gives it almond, quince and pear flavors along with intense bright acidity. It is still missing the richer, toasty character that will come with age. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Awatere Valley,Vavasour,20.0,91.0,"Subtle green notes highlight concentrated fruit in this wine. Drilling down, it's something akin to celery leaf alongside nectarine and ripe citrus. It's plump in the mouth, with a long, balanced aftertaste. Well done, from start to finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château le Doyenne,20.0,91.0,"This rounded, full wine is densely packed with fruit, but also tannins that add balance. Blackberry flavors come through the dry structure to give both richness and freshness. The aftertaste is ripe, juicy and delicious. Drink now, but best from 2015."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Vignerons de Bel Air,20.0,91.0,"A rich wine that is concentrated as well as fruity. It has much of the structure of the Côte de Py, mineral in character, bringing out the granite. Black plums, dark berries and plenty of acidity are all there, producing a wine to age. Drink from 2015."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Les Vins de Vienne,20.0,91.0,"A darn good value, this is a mouthfilling, richly textured wine with several years still ahead of it. It delivers the vintage's hallmark forward fruit, but underscores the raspberries with hints of fudge and a long, velvety finish. Drink now–2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta Vale do Armo,20.0,91.0,"This is a rich and ripe wine, densely textured with firm tannins that provide a solid structure. Made from selected fruit grown in the north of the Tejo region, the blend of 60% Aragonez, 25% Syrah, 15% Merlot is a textured wood-aged wine that has red and black berry fruits followed by balanced acidity. It is ready to drink, but will improve after 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Turchi,20.0,91.0,"Inebriating aromas of hearty tobacco, black earth, cassis and prune kick off another barrel-aged monster from Dave Corey. The cherry syrup and plum liqueur flavors remain bright with strong acidity as well as sturdy tannic structure, meaning this one will last until 2020 at least."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Léoube,20.0,91.0,"This is a soft and ripe wine, full of rounded red berry fruits. The fruit is boosted by its acidity to give a fresh feel. The texture is soft, with a shot of pepper to add complexity at the end."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tertre de Belvès,20.0,91.0,"A structured wine, rich in both tannins and fruit, this wine gives a solid performance. Its black and red berry fruits are already balanced with the tannins, while the acidity lends a delicious lift. Delicious now, but best to wait until 2015."
Shiraz-Grenache,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,20.0,91.0,"A terrific value, this 50-50 blend displays gentle oaking and a hint of warm asphalt, just enough to highlight the wine's plum and black cherry fruit. It's full bodied and features a long finish, outlined by wonderfully fine, dusty tannins. Drink now–2018."
Gaglioppo,Italy,Southern Italy,Librandi,20.0,91.0,"Aromas of perfumed berry, violet, leather, pipe tobacco and baking spice take shape in the glass. The smooth, structured palate delivers layers of ripe black cherry, juicy raspberry, clove, white pepper and mineral alongside firm, fine-grained tannins."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Haut Bourg,20.0,91.0,"Aged for 10 years on its lees, this impressively complex wine shows that Muscadet can age. It is ripe, toasty, spicy and with a rich concentrated texture. It's a special, unusual style of wine that is now fully mature and should be drunk."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Luneau-Papin,20.0,91.0,"The home vineyard of the Luneau family, this five-acre property dates back at least to the 18th century. The wine is ripe, fruity and fragrant. It has a rich background of yellow fruits as well as fresh acidity. With its tight texture, it should be aged, so drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,20.0,91.0,"This wine is almost 50% Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest near-equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The aromas convey mocha, toast, green herbs, dark cherries and spice, while the palate provides lithe, seamless raspberry and cranberry flavors that are impeccably balanced and brightened by tart acidity."
Rosé,US,Washington,Efeste,20.0,91.0,"This is the inaugural release from the winery's estate site, which sits next to famed Boushey Vineyard. A pale salmon color, it's a field blend of Mourvèdre and Grenache, redolent with aromas and flavors of strawberry, orange peel and spice, along with mouthwatering acidity that ties it all together. It's thoroughly delightful."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Quinta de São Sebastião,20.0,91.0,"With 12 months oak of aging, this is a rich wine, still showing spice and toast from the wood. That character is finely balanced by the rich black fruit and the acidity. It is a fine wine, ripe and still developing. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,20.0,91.0,"Appetizing notes of Cox Orange Pippin and ripe red apples with lemon zest make up the nose of this fruity wine. The palate gives them full rein, adding a funky tone of yeast. This wine is characterized by intense, refreshing juiciness that ripples across the palate in fruity abandon. It's dry and refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Eradus,20.0,91.0,"Eradus continues a successful run with this year's Sauvignon Blanc. As usual, it's fairly pungent and herbal upfront, but then delivers waves of passion fruit. It's concentrated and fairly full-bodied for a Sauvignon, with a lingering finish."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Zaca Mesa,20.0,91.0,"This blend of 66% Roussanne, 28% Grenache Blanc and 6% Viognier shows even more Roussanne character than the pioneering winery's single variety Roussanne. Honey, marcona almond, praline and lemon curd aromas lead to a grippy palate full of judiciously presented vanilla, marzipan, and mango flavors, with a beeswax note on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Paul Dolan,20.0,91.0,"Big but balanced, this sturdy, flavorful wine is deep in color and has classic ripe cherry, cedar and cinnamon aromas. The flavors echo the nose, feeling mouth-filling and backed by firm, grippy tannins. An enjoyable wine that doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. Best after 2019."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Alain Jaume et Fils,20.0,91.0,"This Côtes du Rhône, from a plot of vines located just outside Châteauneuf-du-Pape, is a terrific achievement in a challenging vintage. Hints of garrigue, black olive and cocoa add nuance to the ample black cherry fruit, while the finish of this full-bodied wine shows enough grip and astringency to warrant short-term cellaring. Drink 2019–2025."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beira Interior,Companhia das Quintas,20.0,91.0,"Aged for 20 months in wood, this elegant, ripe wine is finely balanced with structure and fruit. Berry flavors intermingle with dusty tannins and an acidity that suggests cool, mountain crispness. It needs to age further, so drink from 2018."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,20.0,91.0,Pure Touriga Nacional from this quinta in the central Douro at Pinhão is rich and finely perfumed. Solid tannins and a concentrated texture are balanced with ripe black fruits and acidity. The wine is firm at this young stage and needs to age further so don't start drinking until 2019
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Pieropan,20.0,91.0,"Not your grandmother's Soave, this is fully loaded, from its charming, fresh aromas of peaches and orange blossoms to its plump, fleshy flavors of stone fruits. And it's all backed by bracing acidity that keeps the ripe flavors lively right through the long, minerally finish. Editors' Choice."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,20.0,91.0,"Spicy edges and hints of heady white lily on the nose are bedded in soft, lemony freshness on the palate where a savory, salty note appears. There is concentration and purity, lip-smacking freshness but also glimpses of riper stone fruit. Lots is happening here; this is alive and probably still too young. Drink 2016–2020."
Syrah,US,California,Klinker Brick,20.0,91.0,"From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance. A really cool Syrah to try on its own that'll go very nicely with meaty, wintery foods."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,20.0,91.0,"This wine is half Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. High-toned aromas of baking spice, herb, dark chocolate and dark cherry are followed by luscious ripe red and black-fruit flavors. It's irresistible in its appeal."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de Vodanis,20.0,91.0,"From vineyards around the town of Rochecorbon on the banks of the Loire, this beautifully balanced wine is dry while full of honey and almond flavors. It is cut by the intense acidity of Chenin Blanc, just showing signs of developing toasty flavors. The aftertaste emphasizes green and citrus fruits."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Summers,20.0,91.0,"This is a stunning wine at this price, sourced mainly from Sonoma County-based vineyards, with another 19% of the grapes from Lake County and 16% from Napa. It includes other Bordeaux red varieties in the mix, as well as tiny amounts of Syrah and Petite Sirah. Medium bodied and dusty in tannin, with dried herb tones, it's structured, velvety and finishes on a dark chocolate note."
Rosé,US,New York,Paumanok,20.0,91.0,"This is a stand out rosé amidst an excellent lineup of New York pinks this vintage. Made from Cabernet Franc, it juxtaposes plump, silken mouthfeel against bright, crisp red cherry and bramble berry notes. It's a sprightly, yet concentrated and deeply satisfying sip."
Gelber Muskateller,Austria,Südsteiermark,Wohlmuth,20.0,91.0,"The intensity of elder blossom in full flower, dusty with pollen, forms a lasting impression on the nose and carries seamlessly onto the palate where it is joined and tempered by lemony freshness and a brisk, refreshing core of lemony acidity. This is heady and unusual: It speaks both of its aromatic variety and its steep, stony site."
Pinot Noir,US,Washington,W.T. Vintners,20.0,91.0,"Showing just a tinge of bronze color, this wine brings aromatic appeal with notes of strawberry and wet rock. The acidity is lively, keeping the focus on the citrus and strawberry flavors. The finish draws out."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,20.0,91.0,"An almost neutral nose opens into a zesty, light-bodied palate that swings with yeasty savoriness and a whole lot of grapefruit zest. Slender, focused and very refreshing. Goes down easily and has that moreish tanginess."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Robertson,De Wetshof,20.0,91.0,"Toasty aroams of grilled apple, peach and honeycomb lead the way on the nose of this attractive wine, though with some restraint and overall balance, thanks to supporting acidity and ripe, juicy fruit flavors on the palate. Notes of sweet orange oil and ginger-peach tea grace the medium-length finish. Drink now–2019."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Derby,20.0,91.0,"Hailing from an extreme coastal vineyard, this 100% stainless steel aged bottling expertly captures that racy freshness. The nose offers rounder cider and apple juice notes, accented with brown pear and clove, but the palate is even more intriguing: nervy acidity, chalky, limestone-like grip and lean Asian pear flavors."
Zinfandel,US,California,Opolo,19.0,91.0,"Although one of the cheaper Zins in the winery's line-up, it is showing the best right now, so drink up. Black cherry, licorice, smoked beef and a deep hibiscus note make for a very heady nose. There is a dense yet soft character to the well-structured palate, where strong flavors of blueberry, crushed slate, tobacco, leather and wild herbs make a tasty convergence."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Starmont,19.0,91.0,"Floral, pretty and light, this wine was made for porch sitting and all-around relaxing. It never gives up on fruit and complexity, offering a medium body and vibrant acidity around the rose-petaled texture. This is a lovely sipper."
Zinfandel,US,California,Boeger,19.0,91.0,"A deep, dark color, ripe blackberry aromas and berry and spice flavors add up to a full-bodied, impressive wine from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills. Smoky, oaky accents help shape the opulent fruit flavors, and enough firm tannins and lively acidity provide good balance."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Haut Bourg,19.0,91.0,"Granite and schist soil planted with old vines has produced this impressive wine. It is softer than it probably was when younger, although it has not lost one bit of its fresh crisp fruitiness and perfumes. The wine is concentrated, rich and is ready to drink."
Weissburgunder,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,19.0,91.0,"The merest touch of peach and Golden Delicious apple plays on the nose. The palate features lively lemon notes on a very slender, brisk and fresh palate, along with a tiny bit of spritz. It shows a depth of fruit: a wine for lovers of subtlety. The crisp apple-peel finish is totally moreish."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Estampa,19.0,91.0,"Dark, concentrated and powerful, this Carmenère-heavy blend pumps out huge cassis, blackberry and cola aromas in front of a racy, tannic, jet-powered palate. Baked, lemon-blackberry and cola flavors are earthy and forceful. Tobacco and cedar notes along with hard tannins push the finish. Drink through 2018."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,19.0,91.0,"One of the best sparkling Vouvrays, this 2005 vintage has an extra richness from the year. It has the mineral, chalky edge of Chenin Blanc, but this is rounded out with pear, white peach and sweet almond flavors. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 2–3 years."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,19.0,91.0,"Crisp and distinctive, with a strong mineral streak, this full-flavored Pinot Blanc has a range of fruit flavors, centered upon apple and pear, but also touching on blood orange and a suggestion of celery as well. Low in alcohol, but high in flavor."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Burgenland,Esterházy,19.0,91.0,"A totally aromatic, floral and rose-spiced nose makes for an unusually fragrant Grüner. The palate shows the same floral spiciness, edged with exotic lychee amidst peppery spice, sprightly lemon acid and Grüner's telltale phenolic edge. This packs in a whole lot of flavor. Make sure you savor every last nuance."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Lumos,19.0,91.0,"This dry, single-vineyard bottling is extremely aromatic, as only Gewürztraminer can be. The ripe lychee and grapefruit is subsumed in a cloud of baby powder. It's quite dry, and for those that want a supremely floral varietal expression of this grape, this is your go-to bottle."
Grillo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Donnafugata,19.0,91.0,"Vibrant and savory, this opens with lovely aromas of spring flower, citrus, herb and white stone fruit. The round, juicy palate offers ripe white peach, juicy grapefruit, pineapple and mineral alongside fresh acidity. A saline note backs up the finish."
Fiano,Italy,Southern Italy,Villa Raiano,19.0,91.0,"The nose is a bit shy but the ripe, enveloping palate has impressive depth, delivering smoke, nut, candied nectarine zest, mature Bartlett pear and ginger. A honeyed mineral note closes the lingering finish. Drink through 2020."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Berne,19.0,91.0,"With Hubert de Bouärd (whose family owns Château Angélus in Bordeaux) as consultant, this estate has produced a ripe wine that has the crispest, purest fruit flavors. Red berries and apples shoot through the lightly tannic texture. The wine will be better from late 2016."
Rosé,France,Provence,Commanderie de la Bargemone,19.0,91.0,"Created by Knights Templar in the 13th century, the estate now consists of 160 acres of vines. This wine has a strong sense of structure, with a zesty tang as well as tannins that enhance the fruitiness of this intense and juicy wine."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Magnum Vinhos,19.0,91.0,"This is a beautiful lightly wood-aged wine. Made from arguably Portugal's greatest white grape, it is rich, smooth and balanced elegantly between toastiness and yellow fruits. The wine is still on the young side and will be better from spring 2018."
Zinfandel,US,California,Steele,19.0,91.0,"Soft, rich fruit, with layers of plum, cherry, berry and accents of toast and vanilla. Smooth, seductive style, plenty of acid, good balance and the fruit is pure, clean and ripe all the way to the lingering finish."
Chardonnay-Semillon,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,19.0,91.0,"This intriguing stickie is predominantly (94%) Chardonnay—an unusual choice for a botrytized wine. Dried apricot and ripe pear aromas lead the way, with the flavors leaning toward intensely honeyed apricot preserves. It's full-bodied, lush and candy-sweet, with a mouthcoating finish."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Bodegas Luzón,19.0,91.0,"A leader in user-friendly Monastrell from Jumilla is Luzón. Altos is the winery's high-expression baby, and if you like a bruiser with char, toast, coffee and other nocturnal characteristics, then look no further. Dynamite in terms of ripeness, with monster black-fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Not for the weak."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,91.0,"This full-bodied, lightly spiced wine seduces with fresh fruit flavors of pear, apple, kiwi and melon. Polished and bracing, it finishes with a lick of wet stone."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Starmont,19.0,91.0,"A dash of Sémillon adds to the playfulness of this wine, which is medium-built and moderate-to-high in acidity. Tangy curls of lemon, lime and grapefruit evolve into a bristling back note of crispness that just begs for oysters."
Zinfandel,US,California,Boeger,19.0,91.0,"Fantastically concentrated fruit flavors seem to turbocharge this very full-bodied, superripe wine. Blackberry, boysenberry and dark chocolate weave in and out of the almost-thick and nicely viscous texture, lingering on the finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Ponzi,19.0,91.0,"This is done in a crisp, fresh and leesy style, with lime-drenched minerality. Flavors of white peach and guava gain volume and density as the wine warms on the palate. It was kept from malolactic fermentation, enlivening a lingering, resonant finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Rui Roboredo Madeira,19.0,91.0,"This ripe wine is concentrated in blackberry tones, with added spice from 12 months in French and American oak. The tannins and the dry core are still developing into what will be a sumptuous wine. Drink from 2019."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Sorin,19.0,91.0,"With a dominance of Mourvèdre, this is big and rich. It has weight, with intense fruit flavors and a dense texture. Structured and concentrated, this is a food-friendly rosé."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Haut-Monplaisir,19.0,91.0,"Solid and perfumed, this expresses all the power of Malbec, with a fruitiness that comes through the firm, dry tannins. Notes of new wood and juicy plum combine well in this concentrated, full-bodied effort, which needs several years to age."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Robert Perroud,19.0,91.0,"Concentrated fruits dominate this ripe, juicy wine. Firm tannins lend structural support to this generous, textured selection. Age it for another year."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Gunn Estate,19.0,91.0,"Takes the bold ripeness of the regular Gunn Estate bottling and kicks it up by adding herbal, passion fruit and pineapple flavors to the mix. The rich, creamy texture is balanced by the freshness and minerality of the lingering finish."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Godelia,19.0,91.0,"Potent earthy cherry and animal aromas are neither too pushy nor overbearing. This is quite full and concentrated, with a ripe-fruit mix of black plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Chocolaty oak is even more out front on a deep finish. Drink through 2024."
Chenin Blanc,Portugal,Portuguese Table Wine,Ribafreixo,19.0,91.0,"Winemaker Mario Pinheiro worked in South Africa and with the Chenin Blanc grape there. Bringing it to the Alentejo produces a surprisingly similar ripe, warm style of wine that's still fresh and citrusy while also having signs of bright pineapple and minerality. Drink from 2015."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Roland Schmitt,19.0,91.0,"A clean aspect shines through this wine that offers all the freshness of green and yellow citrus along with a herbal glint, perhaps of citrus foliage. This is concentrated and comes with disarming purity and freshness that's wonderfully precise and dry."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Nautilus,19.0,91.0,"This is a tight, crisp rendering of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Struck flint aromas add nuance, while the bright lemon-lime flavors whirl together into a citrus sorbet of refreshment."
Viognier,US,Oregon,WildAire,19.0,91.0,"Spicy, punchy and pungent, this bright and crisply defined effort displays a riot of orange and apricot fruit flavors, morphing into a Grand Marnier finish. It's deep and persistent, fully ripe but neither hot nor bitter."
Merlot,Portugal,Bairrada,Nelson Neves,19.0,91.0,"This rich, wood-aged wine is impressive and well aged. It may be made from Merlot but it tastes thoroughly Portuguese with its dry tannins, mint flavors and intense ripe fruit. The tannins are cushioned by this juicy, rich fruitiness. The wine is ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Ponzi,19.0,91.0,"Aromatically compelling with floral, stone fruit and mineral highlights, this offers palate-cleansing freshness. The mineral-drenched flavors blend melon, peach and lemon rind, with a finishing burst of lime. It was fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Hewitson,19.0,91.0,"This light- to medium-weight wine is drinkable now—try it with Coffin Bay oysters if you can—but should also age well for up to 15 years. Notes of citrus, lime and crushed stone are mouthwatering and refreshing."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Jim Barry,19.0,91.0,"This starts off with scents of melon and wet stone. A sense of plumpness unfolds on the attack, then accelerates across the palate in a burst of bright, citrusy acids. A tactile, silky edge to the finish adds length and complexity."
Sémillon,Australia,New South Wales,Three Bridges,19.0,91.0,"This is full and rich but not overly heavy or sweet, coming across as similar to a well-balanced peach compote or cobbler. Hints of mushroon, cinnamon and clove add depth and complexity."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Borra,19.0,91.0,"Borra demonstrates its mastery with whites in this interesting, perfect mélange of sweetness and zip. Made in a dry style, the sweetness is mostly in the aromatics, which imply peach-colored roses, and inviting mouthfeel, which imparts subtle grapefruit and stone fruit amidst all the crispness."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,19.0,91.0,"Zesty lemon and lime aromas add elegance to unctuous white peach and apricot flavors on this delicate, yet remarkably complex wine. Off-dry in style, it balances a youthful fruit profile with nuanced shades of smoke and earth. Nervy citrus acidity drives a long, focused finish."
Meritage,US,California,Cameron Hughes,19.0,91.0,"This wine shows a full-bodied wealth of cassis and black currant within a bold, brooding body. Mild in texture, it allows for robust notes of toasted oak and coffee to form additional complexity."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Gadais Père et Fils,19.0,91.0,"This is an impressively rich and ripe within the light, poised character of classic Muscadet. It balances floral apple and pear fruit with a tight, mineral texture that gives the wine a young character. The extended lees aging has added notes of almonds and spice to this ripe wine. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,US,New York,Boundary Breaks,19.0,91.0,A waxy vein of petroleum cuts enticingly through juicy-sweet pink grapefruit and peach flavors in this dainty semisweet Riesling. It's vivaciously spry yet finishes long on a lingering lacy veil of sweetness. Drink now through 2022.
Zinfandel,US,California,1000 Stories,19.0,91.0,"This approachable wine from the Fetzer organization was aged in Bourbon barrels. It has good balance, wonderful fruit flavors, a polished texture and lingering finish. Dark in color, the aromas suggest ripe berries and cherries, and the flavors flow similarly rich and deep."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,C. von Nell-Breuning,19.0,91.0,"Breathtaking lime acidity pierces through this ebulliently fruity kabinett. The palate is a crush of sweet, fresh yellow peach and apricot flavors, lined by a steely edge of minerality. It's fleeting and frail in mouthfeel yet packs a firm punch through a lingering finish. Drink now through 2020 to enjoy its youthful vitality."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Ducla,19.0,91.0,"This spicy wine is produced by the Mau family. It has an attractive cinnamon element, a touch of toast, and a concentrated texture that brings out a tropical fruit character. Rich and perfumed, this has a great note of ginger snap on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,19.0,91.0,"Tough, tannic and still young, this is a powerful and dense wine. Huge and concentrated black fruits are merged into dry tannins that are still waiting to soften. This ripe, potentially fruity wine needs to age for several years. Drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casca Wines,19.0,91.0,"With a high proportion of generous Alicante Bouschet in the blend, this is a big, bold wine. It has smoky flavors showing a meaty character that's enhanced by 12 months wood aging. Generous tannins give a rich, structured character. It could still do with some aging, so drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,19.0,91.0,"A firm, structured blend of 50-50 Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, this wine is rich and made to age. A dense texture underlies the ripe blackberry fruits and firm tannins. Aged for 18 months in wood, the wine needs time to mature further. Drink from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Elevation Cellars,19.0,91.0,"Consulting winemaker Matthew Loso knows his way around a blend, and this fine Cabernet-Merlot mix shines with focused, dark fruit flavors. It's threaded with streaks of clove, black olive and anise, with real muscle and tannic heft."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Tin Barn,19.0,91.0,"Fermented in 80% stainless steel and 20% barrel, this at first shows a touch of barrel reduction on the nose that dissipates into richly layered stone fruit and fresh lime. Lingering minerality provides freshness and perspective."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Tapiz,19.0,91.0,"This is a dark, rich, modern Cabernet. The nose oozes sweet aromas of coconut and vanilla along with creamy oak and blackberry. The palate is full and chunky in feel, with dark-fruit flavors accented by molasses and pepper. A chewy finish shows grip and lasting acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Starmont,19.0,91.0,"Fermented in a combination of neutral French oak and stainless steel and blended with 2% Sémillon, this lively white sizzles with lemony acidity and a strong streak of grapefruit and lemongrass flavor. With its high acidity and crispness, it has length and zip."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Sierra Cantabria,19.0,91.0,"Earthy plum and berry aromas precede a racy, high-acid palate that's fresh and sharp. Snappy red plum and wild berry flavors finish tannic, with oak spice and mild chocolate notes. This is a power-packed wine that will last a long time; drink through 2028."
Negrette,France,Southwest France,Château Bouissel,19.0,91.0,"The Négrette grape, found almost exclusively in the Fronton appellation near Toulouse, has produced a firm, wood-aged, ripe wine that's packed with attractive juicy red fruits, spice and acidity. The wine has a more serious side, with tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Wines & Winemakers,19.0,91.0,"A superior Vinho Verde, elegant and full-bodied. The creamy texture is partnered with ripe apricot and pear fruits, a touch of green plum and a feeling of opulence along with the acidity. Drink now, or age a year."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Chehalem,19.0,91.0,"This crisp, refreshing and all-stainless Chardonnay represents exceptional value. Bright, fresh fruit flavors mix apples, pears and ripe citrus. It's full-bodied and delivers plenty of mouth-filling richness without resorting to barrel aging for support."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Balthasar Ress,19.0,91.0,"Zesty lime pith and lemon notes abound in this lively off-dry Riesling. It's feather-light in body yet radiant, offering loads of pristine tangerine and apricot flavors. It's juicy and approachable yet effortlessly elegant. A widely appealing sip to enjoy from now to 2021."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Keuka Lake Vineyards,19.0,91.0,"Despite its light-as-a-feather demeanor, a crush of bright red cherry and cranberry flavors pulsate from this dazzling Cabernet Franc. It's refreshingly thirst quenching, yet elegant enough to savor through a long, herb and bramble-toned finish. Drink now through 2016."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Lucien Lardy,19.0,91.0,"Sweet strawberry and cherry fruits are the soft cover to this intensely tannic wine. That structure shows its power, concentration and ageworthiness. Keep for three years and the richness will be fully revealed."
Grenache-Carignan,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Gérard Bertrand,19.0,91.0,"Muddled blackberry, black cherry and boysenberry are the initial aromas on the nose of this wine, with supporting notes of sweet spice, toasted oak, crushed lavender and bay leaf.

Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,19.0,91.0,"Aromatically, this wine does not want to give too much away yet. However, the citrus focus of its linear palate and the refreshment that it holds are already evident. This is Grüner for grown-ups with a neat dose of peppery pungency and great concentration."
Pinot Gris,Austria,Burgenland,Meinklang,19.0,91.0,"There is a wonderfully aromatic element of something floral and tropical on the nose of this unusual Pinot Gris. The fruit expression is very ripe, reminiscent of melon and juicy pear, highlighted with pineapple and fresh lemon, but there also is ample zesty freshness for balance. If you thought you had tasted all that Pinot Gris has to offer, taste this one, which was created from unpruned vines left to their own devices and bearing deliciously few clusters of delicious fruit."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Tangley Oaks,19.0,91.0,"This wine has intense and complex flavors while keeping a graceful texture and great balance between acidity, body and tannins. Aromas suggest raspberries and strawberries with hints of pine forest and earth, while the flavors are vivid and bright."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Lisboa,Adega Mãe,19.0,91.0,"Consultant Anselmo Mendes, well known for his work in the northern Alvarinho region of the Minho and Vinho Verde, has worked his magic here in Lisboa with this beautifully creamy ripe wine. It has touches of yellow fruits that are brightened with acidity and sliced apple flavors. It is still young and likely to develop well, so wait until late 2016."
Viognier,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,19.0,91.0,"Yalumba pioneered Viognier in Australia and the current crop of wines testifies to the company's efforts. This bottling is full bodied and rich to the point of being slightly oily on the palate, where it delivers bold flavors of honey, apricot and grilled pineapple. Drink now."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Clos Ventana,19.0,91.0,"Concentrated and rich up front, this has black fruit aromas of prune, blackberry and cassis, with notes of beef and herb.

Rosé,US,California,ONX,19.0,91.0,"This is a well-rounded rosé that is bound to disappear quickly from the table, with aromas of strawberry, bubble gum and peach riding a rainy-day springtime freshness on the nose. The palate explodes with acidity and textural grip, carrying both ripeness to satisfy New World fans and the deft tactile experience of Old World selections."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tertre de Belvès,19.0,91.0,"Minty wood flavors underline the fruitiness of this ripe wine. Structured and concentrated, it has density and some fine acidity to balance. Its fruit is backed by tannins that suggest a good future. Drink from 2020."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Vecordia,19.0,91.0,"Only 400 cases of this top-level crianza were made, and it smells rich and good, with notes of ripe berry and plum and a mild syrupy note.

Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Wy'East Vineyards,19.0,91.0,"Lively and lush, this is lip-smacking good juice. It's dense with apple, peach and melon fruit flavors that penetrate deeply, buoyed by juicy acidity. Pinot Gris this tasty should be enjoyed lightly chilled, while it is in the first bloom of its freshness."
Merlot,US,Washington,Three Rivers,19.0,91.0,"Another outstanding value from Three Rivers, this powerfully-built wine mixes ripe berry and plum fruit with polished, astringent tannins. It opens well, but really hits its stride on the back palate, with the balance and concentration to age. That said, it's drinking awfully well right now."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,19.0,91.0,"This dry version of Jurançon can't go far from its sweeter partner. It is rich and dry with considerable acidity, but underneath there is honey, spice and a wonderful ripe apricot fruits. It is full, tangy, a wine for food. Drink from 2018."
Carignane,US,California,Graziano,19.0,91.0,"This is a quietly intense wine with a good, deep color, nice aromatics like black plums, and tasty prune flavors. Not too full bodied and supported by taut tannins, it has an almost chewy texture and lingering finish."
Sangiovese,US,California,Monte Volpe,19.0,91.0,"This is a hefty wine that's also well-polished and well balanced. Wonderful aromas and flavors blend cedar, cinnamon, tobacco, red cherry and black plum, while a blanket of fine-grained tannins wraps everything up in an appetizing grip."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Spain,Catalonia,Masies d'Avinyo,19.0,91.0,"Slightly rusty in color and ready to drink, this lovely blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot conveys a lightly roasted bouquet, with cigar box, earth notes and tons of berry fruit. It feels rich but lively, with sweet black-fruit flavors, cocoa, mocha and licorice. This is toasty and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,Morgenhof,19.0,91.0,"A stunning wine, with great balance and layers of flavor. Baked apple, melon, honeysuckle and delicate fynbos notes dance on the nose and palate, with a toasty thread that ties it all together. A peach-pit nuttiness remains throughout the long finish. Delicious now, but should age nicely through 2015."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Charles Heintz,19.0,91.0,"From the producer's estate ranch, a coveted source of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a 100% stainless-steel wine, low in ripeness, that's enthusiastic in watermelon, cherry and strawberry, smelling like summer. Dark pink-red in color, it's crisp, light, tangy in acidity and everything you want in a quaffing wine."
G-S-M,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,19.0,91.0,"Full-bodied, lush and supple in the mouth, this blend of 40% Grenache, 38% Shiraz and 22% Mataro is the Australian version of a barbecue wine, bursting with rich, ripe fruit. Chocolate, mocha and plum shadings dominate, ending on a soft, warm note. Drink now–2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tour Prignac,19.0,91.0,"This is a ripe wood-aged wine drawn from a selection of barrels. Eucalyptus flavors go with the black fruits and solid tannins. The wine is dense, and still obviously very young. It is going to be an impressive ripe wine. Drink from 2019."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,19.0,91.0,"With strong wood-aging flavors, this is a full, very ripe and concentrated wine. Coming from old vines, it has depth of flavor, both fruity and rich. Peach and pear flavors dominate, along with spice from wood aging. The wine needs some aging, so drink from 2015."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Thörle,19.0,91.0,"Lime and gooseberry are gilded with candle wax and smoky minerals in this bracing dry Riesling. Lemon and tart tangerine flavors drench the palate, leaving a honed, steely focus on the finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Commanderie de la Bargemone,19.0,91.0,"The origins of this estate go back to the 13th century when it was the property of the Knights Templar. The large 400-acre vineyard has produced this fine rich wine, full of ripe red fruits and with a bright herbal edge. It is bone dry, crisp and ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Chantelys,19.0,91.0,"This is a fruity, Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, with tannins that support and balance the black currant flavor. Wood aging lightly brushes the structure."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Adelsheim,19.0,91.0,"Bright and spicy, this has flavors of melon and pear. Balanced throughout, it finishes with a lightly toasty accent. Superb winemaking shines here."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Pondera,19.0,91.0,"Lighter in color, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend shows alluring notes of cherry, assorted herbs and bittersweet chocolate. It's elegant in style with a velvety feel to the fruit flavors."
Syrah,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,San Pedro,19.0,91.0,"Excellent Syrah for the price. The dry, balsam wood nose includes earthy berry fruit aromas, olive and herbs. It's herbal but ripe in the mouth, with a lively feel and driving flavors of cherry, blackberry, olive and dry herbs. Fold in some cedar, bitter chocolate, heat and tobacco and you have the total package. Drink now through 2012."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,91.0,"From old vines that offer more texture, steely minerality and nuance than young vines can deliver. You might find less fullness to the fruit, but this more than compensates with its robust depth. Lemon polish, Key lime, a bit of grapefruit and much more."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Chehalem,19.0,91.0,"The fruit shines brightly in this all-stainless cuvée. Ripe golden apples are at the core, with hints of peach and papaya. It's a lovely, forward, ready-to-drink style that brings extra concentration and detail that is all too rare in unoaked Chardonnays."
Zinfandel,US,California,Graziano,19.0,91.0,"An unusual level of flavor concentration and density of texture make this wine substantive in mouthfeel, intriguing in depth, and a good wine to age for a few years. It has touches of sage and sweet oak in the aroma, plus full-bore flavors of blackberry and black cherry on the palate. With great structure due to firm tannins and acidity, it will be best to drink after 2019."
Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,E. Guigal,19.0,91.0,"More than half of the blend is Viognier, which no doubt accounts for its dramatic aromas and flavors of exotic tropical fruit, only just reined in by more citrusy notes. It's full bodied and round in the mouth without being at all flabby, with a crisp, clean, lingering finish. Drink it over the next year."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Angel Vine,19.0,91.0,"Angel Vine sources excellent fruit, and makes what is arguably the most hedonistic, California-style Zinfandel in the Northwest. Here blended with 13% Primitivo, the sweet and liquorous berry fruit flavors are deep and luxurious. Buttressed with juicy natural acidity, this wine does not show its 14.8% alcohol."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Caves Aliança,19.0,91.0,"Full bodied and rich, this has a juicy core followed by firm, minerally tannins and intense acidity. Wood aging adds complexity to this impressive, ageworthy effort."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Arthur Metz,19.0,91.0,"A floral freshness is the first impression on the nose, followed citrus and green apple. There is levity and exuberance here, with a palate that has light-bodied, brightness and a frothy but softly foaming mousse, enlivened by a dry, fresh feel."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,19.0,91.0,"King Estate consistently delivers, and this is a delicious, creamy, textural wine. Full-throttle fruit combines lemon, lime, pineapple and candied citrus rind, underscored by refreshing minerality. Give it a slight chill and drink now through 2020."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,91.0,"This is a fruit-powered wine, loaded with fresh pear, melon and tropical flavors. It shows no sign of having suffered from the wet, cool weather that hit Oregon during the 2007 harvest. It seems riper than the perfectly balanced '06 bottling, with lower acids and a streak of vanilla and coconut wrapping up the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de São José,19.0,91.0,"Ripe and rich, this has blackberry fruit and well-integrated tannins. A year's wood aging has given it structure and concentration. The wine will mature well and gently. Drink from 2020."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes,19.0,91.0,"One of a range of single-vineyard wines, this is tight and still very young. It has a chalky texture, feeling very mineral and nervy. The fruit hints at lemon and green plum, needing time to fill out. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Bertinerie,19.0,91.0,"Rich, wood-aged wine, smooth and ripely fruity. Aromas of mint lead to the polished, ripe, elegant fruit, the tannins surrounded by a comfortable fruit texture. It will age over 4–5 years."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Stevens,19.0,91.0,"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), limned with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Cantina del Nebbiolo,19.0,91.0,"Mouthwatering aromas of wild berry, baking spice, toast and anisette take center stage on this vibrant wine. The fresh, structured palate delivers juicy red cherry, cinnamon, white pepper and sage alongside youthful, bracing tannins."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,L'Amandine,19.0,91.0,"This shows a touch of evolution in its faded rim, but the aromas of cherries, cinnamon and mocha remain pristine. The tannins are smooth and supple, subtly framing expressive flavors of cherries, chocolate, espresso and baking spices. Drink now–2022."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Henry Fessy,19.0,91.0,"A really ripe wine, rich and with a generous feel to it. The sweet cherry fruit is powered with plum juice, dense tannins and structure. A wine for aging."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Adelsheim,19.0,91.0,"A terrific value in a benchmark Oregon Pinot Gris, this is bright and refreshing, with the palate-cleansing minerality that characterizes all of the Adelsheim white wines. Jicama and melon and pear fruits mingle seamlessly, and the wine's texture and length are impressive."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Beresan,19.0,91.0,"There should be plenty of buzz about The Buzz. Dense and dark, loaded with black fruits, coffee grounds and ground pepper, this high-alcohol, slightly volatile wine is not unlike some cult wines selling for four times the price."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Lavernette,19.0,91.0,"The Boissieu family produces a style of Beaujolais that is rich, packed with fruit and with a structure that allows for some aging. This wine, from a certified biodynamic vineyard, has black plum skin and cherry flavors along with a tight aftertaste that will soften. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Starmont,19.0,91.0,"Pretty in honeysuckle and gardenia, this bright wine, blended with 5% Sémillon, recalls fresh-squeezed lemonade before the sugar, refreshing and intensely delicious. The acidity is balanced by enough weight to dial the volume down and flavors of rich, lush melon."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de la Jaubertie,19.0,91.0,"Inky black wine, very dense and packed with new wood. It's young and the tannins are still very forward. But it has the weight of delicious black fruits and tense acidity to promise good aging. Give this fine wine at least 4–5 years."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Buchegger,19.0,91.0,"Aromatic notes of crushed citrus foliage promise freshness. The palate does not disappoint: there is the pure, taut linearity of lemon and lime zest, gilded with some rounder notes of mandarin. A sleek, statuesque and above all refreshing beauty."
Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,19.0,91.0,"Restrained hints of freshly cut red-apple peel tease you throughout. They mingle with fresh citrus on a streamlined palate which has defined freshness and a zesty reserve of acidity. Wonderfully balanced and bright, this finishes long and clean."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Stadlmann,19.0,91.0,"Ripe notions of Mirabelle and Reine Claude plums exude their fresh, fruity flavors. On the palate they gain focus with lemon and lime zest. A wonderfully light-footed, balanced and zippy Riesling with a spicy edge of conifer and citrus foliage. The aftertaste is astonishingly lasting. A beauty."
Riesling,US,New York,Red Tail Ridge,19.0,91.0,"Scents of peach and melon are layered with deep mineral tones on this gorgeously aromatic Riesling. The palate is lavish, with stone fruit and blossom flavors, yet it's steely and dry, with a waxy richness that lends volume and power to the finish. This is elegance epitomized."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,19.0,91.0,"This comes on tight and tart, with substantial flavors of apple, pear and peach. The depth and juicy acids suggest you'll want to put this on the dinner table alongside grilled halibut or swordfish, lightly spiced with lemon pepper and a splash of olive oil."
Chardonnay,Austria,Südsteiermark,Strauss,19.0,91.0,"Friendly, pure notes of freshly cut yellow apples have a minty, fresh aspect that enlivens nose and palate. This is fresh but comes with softened, slightly rounded, creamy edges. A very friendly, clean-cut light-footed but full-fruited Chardonnay showing some lovely midpalate texture and lots of freshness."
Pinotage,South Africa,Swartland,Painted Wolf,19.0,91.0,"Aromas of dark forest berry, smoke, cigar-box spice and tobacco leaf immediately waft from the glass of this forward and robust Pinotage. The wine's boldness continues to shine on the full palate, loaded with gripping tannins and layers of blackberry, boysenberry, roasted cocoa nib, pepper and toasted oak flavors. Drinkable now, but should benefit from some time in the cellar; try after 2015."
Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,19.0,91.0,"Tender notes of ripe Mirabelle plum play on the nose alongside an earthier element. The palate becomes fuller and fruitier, expressing more of that juicy Mirabelle on its lemon-toned and streamlined body with a zesty texture. The finish is lip-smacking and bright, echoing with lemony fruit."
Chardonnay,US,California,Ex,19.0,91.0,"This is a lovely and well-balanced display of unoaked Chardonnay, with all of the flowery frills yet none of the treacly, overly tropical touches. Light in the glass, it shows guava, jasmine water and a lime-skin tartness. The palate is amazingly fresh, with guava, papaya, peach and ripe pear flavors that persist deep into the finish."
Assyrtico,Greece,Sithonia,Porto Carras,19.0,91.0,"This distinctive white starts with an aromatic, almost Riesling-like nose of flowers, with a touch of citrus focus. On the palate, vanilla spice and pronounced fruit mingles with the bracing edge of lemon peel and mineral. An elegant white with unique regional flair."
Rosé,France,Provence,Commanderie de la Bargemone,19.0,91.0,"From this estate founded in the 13th century comes a finely made wine. Its dryness combines well with great flavors of red currant, raspberry and lime. It is delicious with food or as an apéritif."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,91.0,"Bone dry, this succulent, citrus-soaked Riesling is a textural marvel. Mixing grapefruit, lime and pear fruit flavors, its racy acidity underscores its complexity."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,91.0,"One of Oregon's finest values in Pinot Gris, this offers big, juicy flavors of luscious apple and pear, backed with punchy citrus. The ample acidity tastes of lemon and grapefruit, and a notable wash of minerality comes up in the finish. The blend includes small percentages of Gewürztraminer and Muscat."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodega Classica,19.0,91.0,"Berry and plum aromas start out aggressive before settling on earth tones and cinnamon spice notes. This feels juicy, ripe and well constructed. Flavors of raspberry, currant and plum are mildly peppery, while savory earth notes continue the wine's good vibes and solidity. Drink through 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Manuel Carvalho Martins,19.0,91.0,"This is a smooth, rich wine. It has just the right amount of tannin to give structure and add to the ripe black fruits. A blend of classic Douro grapes gives a wine that is dense, firm and also generously ripe. Drink this fine wine now."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Proemio,19.0,91.0,"A fine value among moderately aged Malbecs. Smells like a well-grilled steak along with earthy berry and dry oak. Feels fresh and pure, with proper balance and a lively mix of toast, coconut, blackberry, spice and textured tannins. Compact and just right on the finish. 500 cases made; excellent for under $20."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weixelbaum,19.0,91.0,"Although the wine is tightly wound, it's ready to spring into full-fruited apricot action. Mineral tautness runs through this rich, concentrated and seriously-minded white. Drink from 2016."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Richard Rottiers,19.0,91.0,"From one of the rising stars in Beaujolais, this ripe wine has both a tense minerality and rich black fruits from vines that average 60 years. It is balanced between the very fresh acidity and a dry edge that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016. The vineyards are certified organic."
Merlot,US,New York,Keuka Spring,19.0,91.0,"Gorgeous rose, plum and bramble notes perfume this exceptionally fragrant Merlot. Its complexity extends through the palate with bright cherry and plum flavors bolstered by savory nuances of olive and dried herb. Crisp acidity and fine persistent tannins guide a long finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Magnum Vinhos,19.0,91.0,"This ripe, perfumed wine is an opulent blend of Touriga Nacional with smaller proportions of Tinta Roriz and Alfrocheiro. It is juicy, ripe, concentrated and dense, with abundant black fruits. This harmonious wine could age a little longer and will be at its best from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Manuel Carvalho Martins,19.0,91.0,"Full of dark tannins, this has bold black fruits, with acidity to balance. The wine is impressive with its weight, concentration, dense texture and spicy aftertaste. Drink this wine from 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Stevens,19.0,91.0,"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), lined with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Steele,19.0,91.0,"The richly tannic texture of this full-bodied, well-balanced wine makes it a pleasure to sip, supporting ripe fruit flavors and a generous dash of oak spice. Concentration, layering and depth all add to the enjoyment."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kopriva,19.0,91.0,"Spicy acidity and a refreshing lift of lemon verbena highlight this unoaked wine, framing its medium body and lemon verbena, mandarin orange and grapefruit peel flavors."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Meinklang,19.0,91.0,"Fresh blueberry and plum play on nose and palate. Lively freshness permeates the glass, accentuating the wine's tart, precise fruitiness. It's medium bodied with moderate grip, lots of verve and a nervy, fresh and totally appetizing finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Trinity Vineyards,19.0,91.0,"Massively fruity, this is an apple/pear bonanza, fleshy and almost lasciviously delicious. The huge fruit flavors convey an impression of sweetness, though this is not identified as off dry. It has tremendous density and length."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Schwarzböck,19.0,91.0,"The combination of ripe, almost tropical fruit notes, bright, lifting acidity and a meltingly rounded mouthfeel makes for ultimate refreshment. Depth of flavor keeps you going back for more of that zesty length."
Pinot Gris,Austria,Burgenland,Meinklang,19.0,91.0,"The nose informs subtly about slight oak and freshly cut green and yellow apples. The palate is apple-fresh and rounded with a pleasant midpalate weight. Hints of smoke and hazelnut glint happily here and there, making for a very appetizing Pinot Gris—a world apart from the popular Italian style."
Primitivo,Italy,Southern Italy,Varvaglione Vigne & Vini,19.0,91.0,"Made with bush-trained vines that give very low yields, this delivers concentrated flavors of spiced plum, ripe blackberry, nutmeg, orange peel and black pepper. It's vibrant, smooth and balanced with firm, velvety tannins. The lingering finish closes on a licorice note."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Beresan,19.0,91.0,"It is difficult to find a blend this good from the region in Walla Walla known as The Rocks District for less than $30. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah are combined resulting in a deeply-flavored wine with blue and black fruits, licorice and a streak of scrumptious caramel. A super value, and just plain delicious."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Brian Carter Cellars,19.0,91.0,"Opulento is done entirely with Portuguese varieties. Quite young, grapey, rich and supple, it's packed with primary, brambly blackberry fruit with a smooth, chocolatey finish. This should age well for at least a decade."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Losada,19.0,91.0,"Ripe, fleshy, minerally blackberry and black-cherry aromas are pure, deep and suggest high quality that's confirmed later on. In the mouth, this Mencía from an excellent vintage is racy and pumped up, with acidic energy and tannic grab. Roasted black-fruit flavors come with notes of spice cake and salt. A long, full finish confirms how good this is; drink through 2022."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Ingrid Groiss,19.0,91.0,"Wet moss, green apple and russet-pear peel create a nose that is spicy, fresh and fruity. The palate concentrates these flavors against a backdrop of zesty citrus freshness. Compact and taut, the body is accentuated by slight spritz, and is very appealing in its zesty vigor."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,19.0,91.0,"Ripe and creamy, a classic sparkling Vouvray showing well in a cool year. It has weight and richness as well as fresh nuts and spice flavors, with just a touch of pepper. The acidity is well in balance."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Staete Landt,19.0,91.0,"The blending of estate-grown lots given different vinification and maturation regimes has yielded uncommon elegance and complexity in a wine of this price. Stone fruit, citrus and modest herbal notes merge seamlessly on the medium-bodied palate, while the mouthfeel has a silky-creamy texture that's undeniably appealing."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Global Wines,19.0,91.0,"A rich wine with six months in oak that gives it both a toasty and a creamy character. It is full of ripe yellow fruits, spice and just a cool hint from the Monte de Cal vineyards on the Atlantic coast. The wine is ready to drink."
Syrah,Chile,Marchigue,Polkura,19.0,91.0,"This lush, ripe Syrah has its precision points across the bouquet—namely graphite, mint and pure black-fruit scents. On the palate, this blends juicy liveliness with layered richness. Flavors of blackberry, dark plum, chocolate, mixed spices and fresh herbs add up to one yummy, well-oaked, balanced wine. Drink through 2018."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Nieto Senetiner,19.0,91.0,"Ripe black-fruit aromas are backed by hints of road tar and toasty oak. A round, firm palate feels right, while familiar high-end Malbec flavors of blackberry, baking spices and chocolate end with controlled tannins, spice notes and a full-bodied feel that's not too fleshy or soft. Drink through 2021."
White Blend,Greece,Greece,Tsantali,19.0,91.0,Floral and exotic fruit aromas are followed by an elegant balance of white peach and citrus fruit flavors in this layered white. The wine is complex but lifted with refreshing acidity. The finish is a combination of lush fruit and spice.
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,18.5,91.0,"Appetizing notes of apple and yellow plum reach the nose. The palate is fizzing with freshness and redolent of fresh red-apple peel with overtones of honey. The mousse is creamy and accentuates the dry refreshing finish. A touch of dried citrus peel on the nose suggests slight development. The palate adds judicious weight and backbone in the form of very fine creamy mousse and a lovely structure that holds mellow apple fruit and bright citrus. The finish is dry, fresh but mellow. Both autolysis and lemon freshness become apparent on the long aftertaste. It's a sophisticated, refreshing but rounded winter time apéritif."
Rosé,US,California,Kokomo,18.0,91.0,"Pretty in jasmine, lemon and orange, this is a crisp, dry and lovely wine, integrated with just enough heft on the body and a surprisingly deft length on the finish. Stock up for gatherings."
Chardonnay,US,California,Taken Wine Co.,18.0,91.0,"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Château d'Or et de Gueules,18.0,91.0,"Another terrific value from the Costières de Nîmes, this features exquisite scents of grilled herbs—think thyme, rosemary, lavender—with ripe blueberries and roasted meat. It's open-knit and velvety on the palate already, so drink it now through 2018."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Türk,18.0,91.0,"Both tropical and herbal notes join the citrus flavors on the nose, hinting of passion fruit as well as mint. The palate tones this down and puts ripe lemon in the spotlight. Sleek and slender, the body has a creamy element of yeast but is dry and brisk. The finish is very balanced and lasting."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,18.0,91.0,"Additions of Sauvignon Musque and Sauvignon Gris add complexity to this rewarding white, full bodied and rounded in anise, creamy vanilla and apricot tones. Succulent and lengthy, it teases in an underbelly of herb and grass. It saw stainless-steel fermenting plus time in French oak, chestnut and acacia."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Poças,18.0,91.0,"Solid tannins lead into a wine that balances very dry, dark fruits with dense wood textures. It's a solid, chunky, bold wine, richly fruity and still young. Drink this firm, ageworthy wine from 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,18.0,91.0,"This is a strongly mineral wine, textured and rich at the same time, with fine acidity. Blackberry fruit dominates the palate, with rich tannins and cool freshness. It tastes of terroir, a true Dão from the granite soils. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Leyda Valley,San Pedro,18.0,91.0,"Fresh, angular aromas of jalapeño, bell pepper, beach breeze and citrus fruits are elegant, chiseled and potent. This tingles with acidity and tastes minerally, with orange, tangerine and lime flavors. A stony, bright, pure finish confirms its high quality."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,18.0,91.0,"Slightly more earthy pear fruit appears on the nose. The palate bounces with freshness and verve, fizzing with a little white pepper here and there. The core is textured and shows some concentration with real citric force. Lovely on its own, even better with food. Simply lovely."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Bodkin,18.0,91.0,"This has a vibrant yellow-gold color and aromas like fresh herbs and sliced celery. Almost electric acidity pulses in the crisp grapefruit, lime and melon flavors that lead to a lingering finish. The vivid freshness and tangy texture sets it apart from the crowd, and it will work wonderfully with foods from raw oysters to roast chicken."
Riesling,US,New York,Empire Estate,18.0,91.0,"A promising start for Empire Estate's first bottling, this perfumed dry Riesling is marked by lifted aromas of orange blossom and citrus peel. Concentrated tangerine and honey flavors have an electric vibe, balancing a nervous edge of lemon-lime acidity against a honed, steely polish."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Yamhill Valley,18.0,91.0,"This old-vine Riesling matches medium sweetness (25g/L) to ample acidity. It's a dense and flavorful style, taut and fleshy at the same time. The peachy fruit hints at ripe banana as well, with a lick of butterscotch adorning the finish. Drink now through 2022."
Sylvaner,France,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,18.0,91.0,"The nose is closed but the palate is fresh and lithe, arriving light, citrus-scented, and surrounded by a chorus of freshness that leaves mouth and soul utterly refreshed."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,18.0,91.0,"A selection of wines made after harvest, this Reserva is a firm, perfumed, structured wine. It has powerful tannins that go with the black fruits and acidity, but it's also deliciously juicy—a powerful and ripe wine that will improve for several years."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,18.0,91.0,"Tannat and Pinenc, both native to this region of Southwest France, give a ripe, juicy wine, packed with red-fruit flavors surrounding a more dense tannic core. It has a smoky flavor that gives an edge to the great fruit flavors. Drink in 3–4 years."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Antico Colle,18.0,91.0,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas that recall red berry, mint, tilled soil and a hint of game. The structured, elegant palate offers juicy wild cherry, clove, tobacco and a licorice note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. This will benefit from a little more aging. Drink 2016–2021."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta de Chocapalha,18.0,91.0,"The main estate wine from Chocapalha, this is firm, with a beautiful balance between tannins and fruit. Blackberry and wood-derived spice notes are cut with acidity. It's elegant and ready to drink."
Barbera,US,California,Sera Fina,18.0,91.0,"Beautifully polished, this wine has an alluring blend of fruit and spice flavors and an especially lush texture. The bouquet evokes violets, raspberries and blueberries, and the palate goes deeper into blackberry and clove flavors. The balance is great because it matches its acidity with a feeling of richness and length."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Clos Puy Arnaud,18.0,91.0,"This attractive, juicy wine is full of red fruit. It has strawberry and crisp red currant flavors as well as fine acidity. The result is a wine with good balance, richness, spice and tannins. Drink from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Pôpa,18.0,91.0,"This José Ferreira family project in the Douro Valley had its first vintage in 2007. This partially wood-aged wine is rich and full of black fruits. Fermentation in open lagars has given the wine a ripe character as well as dense tannins. The wine is concentrated and likely to age a little further, so drink from 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Vinha Paz,18.0,91.0,"Structured with a strong mineral character, this is a full rich wine. Its density comes from the fermentation in stone lagars giving richness and opulence. The wood aging has added to the smoothness that is balanced by the intense acidity of the black currant fruits at the end. Drink from 2018."
Viognier,US,California,Workman Ayer,18.0,91.0,"Aromatic fruit and floral notes join delicious honeydew melon flavors as this full-bodied wine wraps around the tongue, leaving a soft smooth impression and lingering on the finish. Very good concentration, layers of flavor and that lasting finish lift this wine above the ordinary."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Iris Vineyards,18.0,91.0,"Don't be fooled by the low alcohol—this is fully ripened, finished, dry yet packed with delicious pear fruit flavors. Light suggestions of grapefruit and green apple add interest, and the fullness and freshness of the fruit is most impressive."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Stadlmann,18.0,91.0,"A spicy, almost coniferous fragrance joins the pear notes of this rounded, concentrated Grüner. Layers of green, fruity flavors unfold: ivy and Conference pear, greengage and crushed leaf. Take a little time over this one, it will reward you with countless, spicy expressions."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Gruber Röschitz,18.0,91.0,"You are in for a treat with this subtle, fruitful Riesling which reveals its subtle charms rather slowly. The nose is shy but the palate shines with ripe, aromatic apricot fruit, accentuated by lemon freshness and centered around a concentrated core of fruit and zest. This is slender but generous, refreshing and lasting. A wine with utter charm to take time over."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Maverick,18.0,91.0,"It's hard to believe such a wine can come from the Barossa, a region known for size and richness. But this is part of a new wave of Aussie Shiraz—medium in body and silky in style, with moderate alcohol levels. Healthy doses of oak impart notes of hickory smoke, cedar and vanilla to the plum fruit. Drink now–2025."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,18.0,91.0,"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin. Mixed green fruits, apple, citrus, and a lightly toasty nose set up a wine with impressive length. The midpalate richness includes ripe melon, butterscotch and cinnamon spice. It's all barrel-fermented in neutral oak. This is a real strength of the brand."
Chardonnay,US,California,Lava Cap,18.0,91.0,"Rich but subtle, this medium-bodied wine is not overtly fruity or oaky, but blends complex nuances in an attractive and compelling way. The term “battonage” refers to stirring the lees while the wine ages in barrels or tanks, which can enhance the creamy texture. It smells like vanilla and nutmeg, and tastes creamy and buttery backed by ripe apple and a touch of lemon. It feels rich in texture, elegant rather than bold."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Telmo Rodríguez,18.0,91.0,"Smooth, lush blackberry, blueberry and pastry aromas cue up a fully tannic but well-balanced palate. This wine tastes toasty, chocolaty and peppery, with underlying ripe blackberry fruit. A minty, toasty finish runs chocolaty and long, with no let up. Drink through 2022."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,18.0,91.0,"Riesling has an ability to unite opposites: ripeness and tartness of fruit, a slender frame and unexpected weight. This dry and harmonious wine shows off these contradictions perfectly. A spiky freshness of citrus meets the generosity and juiciness of stone fruits. It is the dialectic between them that thrills."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Paterna,18.0,91.0,"Made with Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo and Colorino, all organically farmed, this savory red opens with aromas of perfumed berry, blue flowers, new leather and a balsamic note. The juicy, delicious palate delivers black cherry, plum, licorice, clove, menthol, sage an earthy note of game alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity. Enjoy through 2018."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Tenuta Roveglia,18.0,91.0,"This savory white opens with refined fragrances of citrus blossom and orchard fruit. The juicy palate offers white peach, tart green apple, mouthwatering citrus and a note of Mediterranean herb. It's nicely balanced, with crisp acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Ataíde Semedo,18.0,91.0,"Blending Baga and Touriga Nacional, this wine delivers a big sweep of red fruits and spice. Juicy acidity bursts from the glass. The firm tannins of both grapes are still there and need time to round out. Give this wine until 2017."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Aujardière,18.0,91.0,"The Grandlieu lake, to the west of the Sèvre et Maine Muscadet vineyards, produces softer wines, like this. This wine is ripe, with hints of toast and vanilla as well as fresh and crisp apple acidity. It's a full-bodied, rounded wine that is just ready to drink and will be better from 2016."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Vista Hills,18.0,91.0,"Don't be misled by the low alcohol; there's more than a smidgen of residual sugar in this wine. It works to good effect, adding richness to the fruit and roundness to the mouthfeel. Pear, peach and apricot flavors fill the palate, with generous streaks of honey and tea adding further complexity."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Cave Freudenreich,18.0,91.0,"Just off dry, this is a rounded soft wine that takes its name after the sun god Apollo from the sunny exposure of the vineyard. It has a rounded, generous feel as a foil to its more steely, crisp character. A wine that certainly needs aging for 3–4 years."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Thistle,18.0,91.0,"Thistle consistently produces one of Oregon's best Pinot Blancs. This is creamy and fresh, bursting with ripe pear and melon, and streaked with a gentle hint of coconut and vanilla. The lush finish seems to carry on for a full minute or longer."
Red Blend,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,18.0,91.0,"This 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well. It has weight, but also a smooth texture and juicy swathes of black plum and red berry fruits. Juicy fruit flavors are encased in a firm, tannic shell that's solid and dark. The wine is drinkable now after decanting, but could benefit from aging until 2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,91.0,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Alicante Bouschet with Syrah, this is a finely structured wine. It is spicy, packed with black-currant fruits and with ripe tannins. The fruits and the dusty texture are just coming together, although the wine will be better from 2017."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Rheingau,Carl Ehrhard,18.0,91.0,"Perfumed and pert, this elegant entry-level Spätburgunder offers surprising bang-for-your buck. Sumptuous blackberry and cherry flavors are ripe and concentrated, accented by hints of dried herb, cedar and anise. It's supple in texture with a sprightly streak of acidity. The finish lingers on soft, pleasantly astringent tannins. Drink now through 2022 to enjoy its fresh perfume."
Albariño,US,California,Morgan,18.0,91.0,"An excellent white-wine choice for any occasion, this bottling offers a complex nose, showing Gala apples, tart honeydew, nectarine, red apple, hay and an intriguing touch of celery. It's clean and tight on the palate, which offers a soft and yet grippy texture, and reveals flavors of Granny Smith apple and wild stonefruit."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Merry Cellars,18.0,91.0,"This wine carries a whiff of honeyed fig, which opens out into a luscious, rich, satisfying, full-bodied Sémillon. It's a complete wine, which seems to run through a lifetime's evolution in the mouth, finishing with a creamy, plush mix of fruit and barrel. Long, seamless and delicious."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sobon Estate,18.0,91.0,"A fascinating wine from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills, this has deep boysenberry and blackberry aromas. Flavors include allspice, cardamom and black cherries, with a meaty nuance. Medium to full bodied, it's not a monster Zin but distinctive and clearly delicious."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Sineann,18.0,91.0,"In 2007 the excellent Celilo vineyard serves up a stunning Gewürztraminer. The brilliantly displayed floral, citrus and mineral scents lead into a soft, rich and thoroughly delicious wine with layers of green berry, citrus, melon and mineral, along with refreshing acids and a streak of toasty hazelnut."
Chardonnay,US,California,Waterstone,18.0,91.0,"This is a floral, zesty and vibrant white wine, given six months in French oak, half of it new. With a complex hit of briny salt and citrus, it flirts between layers of savory and sweet, finding just the right balance of structure and acidity."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,Muròla,18.0,91.0,"This greets the taster with a heady aromas of yellow spring flowers, as well as whiffs of tropical fruit. The palate delivers intense peach, apricot and citrus flavors accented by notes of mineral and brine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,91.0,"This is big, concentrated wine produced from old vines. It has a dense blackberry fruit backed by layers of firm tannins. Rich and full bodied, it will be better from 2018."
Sangiovese,US,California,Pietra Santa,18.0,91.0,"With experience making Sangiovese in Italy, it's no wonder that winemaker Alessio Carli shines with the grape from this vineyard planted in rocky limestone 25 miles east of Monterey Bay. Aromas of leather, sour plums and cranberry lead into soft flavors of raspberry fruit, tar and espresso. Leathery grip gives it a slightly rustic feel as well."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Uwe Schiefer,18.0,91.0,"This wine leads with a touch of smoke and cinnamon. The underlying blueberry fruit is brooding and crunchy, bringing freshness to the medium-bodied palate. Aromatic waves of spice and pure, vibrant fruit carry long into the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Girard,18.0,91.0,"Juicy, with a firmness of acidity and a tenacious crispness, this wine evolves in the glass, shedding some of its wet stone and green apple for more voluptuous tenets of Asian pear and nutmeg. Lovely for the table, this is a well-balanced white that'll do well on its own or with food."
Rosé,Austria,Burgenland,Iby,18.0,91.0,"Shimmering with the palest salmon pink, this is a softly scented, restrained but very refreshing rosé. Absolutely dry, it majors on fresh lemon notes with tart inflections of red currant. The slightest fizz helps the freshness even more. Lovely."
Red Blend,US,California,McManis,18.0,91.0,"Known for great values, McManis has upped the ante with this outstanding blend made largely from Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It has a gorgeous, spicy, new-leather, new-oak aroma, and similarly complex, minty and intriguing flavors. The wine tastes full-bodied, firmly tannic but well balanced and poised in style."
Zinfandel,US,California,Amador Foothill Winery,18.0,91.0,"Tart cherry, ripe plum and black cherry flavors and barely a trace of detectable oak character make this a lively, fruit-driven wine. The aroma has touches of clove and black pepper, the texture is not too rich but braced with firm acidity and tannins that keep the fruit flavors zooming along through the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Artezin,18.0,91.0,"A well-made and full-bodied wine, this has generous helpings of succulent blackberry and boysenberry flavors, with a firm texture of tannins and acidity to balance out all that richness. It smells fresh and fruity, tastes juicy and crisp, and seems to gain depth and interest with repeated sips. The blend includes 10% Petite Sirah and 5% Carignan."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Balletto,18.0,91.0,"Balletto is making some fun, brightly crafted whites, like this floral, waxy one, that are not to be ignored amongst all its other estate offerings. Honey and white flower scents punctuate the nose before light, bright layers of lychee and orange flavors come through on the palate."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Jean Sipp,18.0,91.0,"Appetizing and warmly generous pear notes characterize the nose. The palate has the same, friendly fruit, boosted by some residual sugar. The plump fruit is countered by ample lemony freshness that creates an inherent balance. The finish is just off dry, but very refreshing."
Vermentino,Italy,Tuscany,Antinori,18.0,91.0,"In only its second vintage in the U.S., this nutty, mineral-rich, immensely fruity wine from Antinori's coastal estate is a great example of the heights that Vermentino can achieve. This version is full of lime, stone, citrus and marzipan, and is focused from beginning to end"
Malbec,Argentina,Other,Michel Torino,18.0,91.0,"This is one exotic number. The nose shows blueberry, boysenberry, charcoal, plenty of oak and hints of cardamom and star anise. A lush, layered palate is intense but doesn't hit too hard, while concentrated blackberry, licorice and spice flavors set up a peppery, minty finish that's stout and structured."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,91.0,"This oak-aged wine is intense, rich and packed with black fruits. It has spice from the wood as well as from the Syrah in the blend, while the juicy ripe character comes from Alicante Bouschet. It's an impressive concentrated wine that will be best from 2018."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Casa do Valle,18.0,91.0,"From selected grapes, this partially wood-aged wine is a rich take on Vinho Verde. It has weight and a fine creamy texture. The acidity and the orange zest flavors are filled out with ripe apples and green plums with just a hint of toast. Drink from late 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Charles B. Mitchell,18.0,91.0,"Full of delicious dark-fruit flavors, this is smooth and deep, comforting but sophisticated. The fruit flavors are ripe and satisfying, the texture is velvety and broad, the body is full but not heavy."
Merlot,US,California,Camp,18.0,91.0,"This is an amazing wine at this price point, fun and easily enjoyable in its mix of soft, velvety red fruit and firm grip of tannin, backed by plenty of acidity. Stock up for larger gatherings and for midweek meals."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Woodinville Wine Cellars,18.0,91.0,"This young wine is classic and spicy, with still-yeasty aromas of pear and apple. The flavors are focused, with vivid, lightly lemony acidity underscoring highlights of beeswax and flowers."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Wy'East Vineyards,18.0,91.0,"Spicy, sharp, tart and deep. A compact mix of melon, pear, green apple and gooseberry fruit. This has exceptional structure and density for a wine listing such low alcohol, yet no hint of sweetness."
Riesling,US,Washington,Tempus Cellars,18.0,91.0,"An aromatic wine with abundant notes of ripe white peach, apricot, mineral and flowers. It drinks off dry (10.7 g/L residual sugar) with a pleasing sense of tension between the acid and stone fruit flavors leading to a long, persistent finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Moura Basto,18.0,91.0,"A smooth, wood-aged wine that is ripe and polished. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Castelão and Trincadeira is given style by its toast, spice and fresh acidity. It is packed with blackberries that contrast with the firm structure. It needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Suau,18.0,91.0,"This smoky wine already shows a fine balance between oak, spice and bright red fruit. It's structured to age but is also attractive now; its juicy berry flavors show easily through the tannins. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Chantegrive,18.0,91.0,"A leading estate in the southern Graves region, Chantegrive has produced a relatively rich 2007 white, its creamy texture given an edge by apple skin tannins, but still full, open, already generous to drink. There is a great layer of fresh pear juice, which blends well with lime acidity for a final burst of crispness."
Chardonnay,US,California,Camp,18.0,91.0,"Dark golden in color, this light-bodied, vibrantly fresh wine has a twinge of creamy oak influence. That's just enough to give it body and complexity in an otherwise bright package of preserved lemon and a warm, lengthy and salty finish."
Grüner Veltliner,New Zealand,Marlborough,Forrest,18.0,91.0,"Despite coiming in at only 12.5% abv, this is fairly weighty. Restrained aromas of crushed stone set the stage, then bold peach and melon flavors take over, finishing with a bit of celery leaf. Drink now."
Grenache,US,California,Kitá,18.0,91.0,"The delicate yet brilliant pink color of this rosé is stunning (Could it be protected by the darker glass, a rare packaging choice for the style?) and the wine inside matches up, starting with a brisk nose of red apple, white cherry, strawberry and lime. There's red plum and more strawberry to the sip. With a grippy texture and steadily rising acidity, this is one of the better pinks of the vintage."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,91.0,This organic vineyard in the northern reaches of Tejo regularly produces concentrated wines like this. It's richly endowed with fine tannins and black fruit but also has the sort of structure that will allow it to age well. Drink from 2019.
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Brigadoon,18.0,91.0,"This delightful wine, principally fermented in neutral oak, and aged sur lie, offers lovely details of apple flesh and skin, white melon, a hint of daikon radish, and the pinpoint persistence that is the mark of superior winemaking. Pinot Blanc can go in various directions in Oregon, but this bright and acidic wine really shows the way to a style that is at once drinkable, complex and food friendly."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,18.0,91.0,"While sleek and slender in style, there's a steely intensity to this well-priced dry Riesling. It's deeply mineral, wafting of smoke and crushed slate, and vibrantly acidic, but the midpalate yields nicely, offering layers of ripe honeydew and grapefruit. It's silken in texture, with a lingering chalkiness on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Nelson,Seifried,18.0,91.0,"From one of the Nelson region's pioneering winemakers, this is as good a wine as I can remember the Seifried family producing. The combination of subtle snow-pea and bold passion-fruit flavors is spot on, and the wine's ample weight, slightly creamy texture and long, grapefruity finish work together to create a harmonious whole."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,18.0,91.0,"Remarkable power and intensity characterizes this ripe, honeyed wine. Off-dry in style, it's round and rich on the palate with loads of luscious peach and apricot flavors, yet nuanced with layers of white blossoms, lavender and spice. Thoroughly enjoyable now for its floral, fruity exuberance, it's structured enough to develop well through 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Claudia Springs,18.0,91.0,"Wines like this make a strong argument for the future of Pinot Noir grown in this region. The blend includes 10 percent Pinot Meunier, which pumps up the color. It’s a spicy, plummy wonder that’s soft and ready to drink. It tastes of spiced apples and cinnamon, with a hint of violets in the smooth finish."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,18.0,91.0,"The aroma is earthy, while on the palate this wine shows a full-bodied structure and rich, chewy black fruits. There is minerality here, a very textured wine offering spice as well as blackberry and plum-skin flavors."
Port,Portugal,Port,Taylor Fladgate,18.0,91.0,"Bottled in January 2012, this classic LBV has great perfumed fruit, soft and elegant. A blackberry jam flavor dominates, laced with black cherries and soft tannins. Immediately appealing and drinkable now."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Twisted Oak,18.0,91.0,"A deliciously priced blend of 60% Mourvèdre, 13% Syrah and 27% Grenache that'll be tricky to ask for by name but is worth the effort to find and share. This blend shows off brooding dark dollops of spicy fruit, herb and tobacco that are tenaciously balanced by the cherry tones from the Grenache. A fun wine to pass around at parties and barbecues."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,Belisario,18.0,91.0,"This textbook Verdicchio from Matelica opens with enticing aromas of yellow spring flowers, stone fruit and citrus. The delicious palate offers peach, tropical fruit and mineral flavors, with a hint of sea salt."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Plumb Cellars,18.0,91.0,"Surprising and delightful, this blend of Syrah and Merlot brings a complex mix of botanical highlights to a base of citrusy red-berry flavors. Notes of black pepper and granite-like minerality add more interest. The depth and persistence are remarkable in a wine at this price."
Chardonnay,US,California,Barra of Mendocino,18.0,91.0,"This full-bodied wine does a superb job of blending luscious fruit flavors of Anjou pear and fresh fig with a spice rack of nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon. Good concentration and depth help it feel full and creamy on the palate and extend the finish nicely."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Broadley,18.0,91.0,"Certainly a remarkable value, this brings concentrated flavors of ripe raspberry and cherry liqueur into a big, broad and deep midpalate. The exuberance and depth of fruit is astonishing, and the balancing acidity suggests that the wine will retain its freshness through 2020 and beyond. This is one to buy by the case."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Luigi Bosca,18.0,91.0,"This wine is much better than most in its class. The blackberry, graham cracker and exotic spice notes are particular to Bosca, while additional notes of bacon, chocolate and nutmeg add to the pleasure. For anyone looking for quintessential Argentine Malbec at a good price, we say start here."
Riesling,US,New York,Anthony Nappa,18.0,91.0,"Luminous is an apt word to describe this sun-kissed, blossomy wine chock full of plump yellow peach, mango and pineapple flavors. There's so much more beyond fruit here though. A strike of lemon-lime acidity cuts through the palate, lending balance and vibe. The finish is long, accompanied by a delightfully astringent kick of lime zest. Drinks well now but should mature well through 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Awatere Valley,Eradus,18.0,91.0,"This relatively small estate in the Awatere Valley continues to impress. The tomato leaf character of the region comes through loud and clear without being overbearing, being balanced by passion fruit and gooseberry flavors. It's reasonably full in body, yet finishes spicy, prickly and refreshing."
Petit Verdot,Chile,Curicó Valley,Junta,18.0,91.0,"Impressive aromas of dark fruits, blackened spices and herbs lead to a lush, well-executed palate that only falls off after extended airing. Spicy, herbal blackberry flavors spread out on a long, comported finish."
Riesling,US,Washington,Finn Hill,18.0,91.0,"Expressively aromatic, this is sourced from the Lawrence Vineyards on the Royal Slope. It bursts from the glass with scents of body powder, lilacs and lemon oil. It gracefully weaves those accents into a rich body with floral, citrus and tree fruit flavors, rounded off with just a hint of residual sugar. Still medium dry, this is a versatile wine to sip and enjoy solo or with light picnic foods."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,González Byass,18.0,91.0,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,91.0,"The color is almost black, and lots of dark berry and black pepper aromas come out. This wine's flavors are even more pronounced, tasting peppery, meaty and like boysenberries. Dense ­tannins make the mouthfeel thick and layered. A lingering finish attests to its considerable concentration."
Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,France,Loire Valley,Bouvet-Ladubay,18.0,91.0,"The ripe combination of Chenin and Chardonnay gives this always-delicious wine its richness and creamy texture. It is ripe, full-bodied with melon and peach flavors as well as crisper acidity. This limited-production wine is smooth and rich at the end. Drink now."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Gadais Père et Fils,18.0,91.0,"Still young, this wine promises great potential. It has a rich character, full of white fruits that are laced with orange zest and spice. Fresh and crisp while full in the mouth, it will be better in a few months. Drink from 2016."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Mas Blanch I Jové,18.0,91.0,"Cherry, red currant and minerally aromas are fresh and appealing. This blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon is pure and lithe on the palate, while toasty, minerally berry and cherry flavors finish dry, focused and with notes of licorice, cocoa and herbs. This succeeds by offering a little bit of everything good; drink through 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Monte dos Cabaços,18.0,91.0,The Estremoz region in Alentejo is at the heart of one of the major vineyard areas. This rich and now mature wine shows the ripe fruit and structure that can be produced there. It is packed with tarry black fruits and dusty tannins. Drink now.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Diwald,18.0,91.0,"Creamy aloe vera, white pepper, green pear and lemon zest create an irresistible nose. The palate is equally creamy but also comes on light, tiptoe feet. There is a pleasant, slightly bitter zesty edge to the slender palate which belies all the charm. An intriguing, arresting Grüner."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Sorelle Bronca,18.0,91.0,"Fresh and fragrant, this delivers aromas of ripe orchard fruits and nuts, with a whiff of yellow wild flowers. The linear palate offers crisp pear, apple and lightly toasted almond alongside brisk acidity and a firm, refined perlage. It closes on a note of fresh peach and chopped herbs."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Castello del Terriccio,18.0,91.0,"Rondinaia means “swallow's refuge,” but you're going to want to swallow lots of this unoaked wine as proof that great Chard does come from Italy, and that it can be terrific without wood. Emphasizing fragrant apple and pear aromas, it has a wonderful natural texture and a smooth, stony finish."
Syrah,US,California,Ampelos,18.0,91.0,"Made from 80% Syrah, 15% Grenache and 5% Riesling, this magenta-hued wine shows exuberant orange blossom and cherry flavors buoyed by moderate acidity and seaspray-like freshness. It finishes rich and fruity, bringing a creamsicle in summer to mind."
White Blend,US,California,Brander,18.0,91.0,"This unique blend of 37% Sauvignon Blanc, 38% Pinot Gris and 25% Riesling plays each grape to a distinct advantage. Its fresh aromas recall yellow blossoms, jasmine and stone, while the palate bursts with rounded stone fruit and tangy citrus peel flavors, all driven by bright acidity."
Chardonnay,US,California,Saracina,18.0,91.0,"With a very pretty nose of perfumed pear, green apple and lime, this unoaked Chardonnay is nicely soft and easy to drink. Made from organic Chardonnay and a touch of Viognier, this smells and tastes of summer. Even without a hint of oak this retains plenty of richness and a fresh vibrancy on the finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Arbor Brook,18.0,91.0,"Fruit is sourced from a 23–year-old, organically farmed vineyard. With wonderful texture and mouthfeel, it offers a luscious mix of pear, pear skin, and grapefruit—tangy and refreshing. Such a juicy, spicy, lip-licking wine, you can't wait for the next sip."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Lavradores de Feitoria,18.0,91.0,"A deliciously rich and spicy wine, very much in the style of the new Douro wines, softly perfumed, with black plums, sweet and dusty tannins, only a hint of dryness. The wine is balanced, with great fruit and acidity to go with the structure."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Hess Collection,18.0,91.0,"Good ripeness and a sophisticated, complex character make this full-bodied wine interesting to drink. It has classic characteristics like bell pepper and black olive aromas, along with classy blackcurrant and light spicy, oaky notes. Drink now through 2020. (Available exclusively at restaurants.)"
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Castelmaure,18.0,91.0,"A gorgeous Corbières with beautiful expression of the terroir thanks to prominent notes of wild berries and animal laced with accents of garrigue herbs and spice. A hint of cocoa dusts the firmly structured mouth, the palate brimming with flavors of boysenberry and mulberry. Tobacco leaf and licorice root remain on the close."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Iby,18.0,91.0,Pure blueberry fruit is given extra lift by sprays of white pepper. There is a wonderful balance between the crunchy freshness of just-ripe fruit with all its grip and bite and the generosity and purity of well-farmed fruit. There might be some rusticity around the edges but there also is innate elegance.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Leth,18.0,91.0,"Ripe, zesty lemon peel and white pepper come in an unusual but very convincing union that bewitches nose and palate. There is real concentration at the core and tons of spice and freshness on a very focused, driven palate. This is utterly refreshing and packs a real punch."
Chardonnay,US,California,Saracina,18.0,91.0,"This is a fresh-tasting wine with great balance that doesn't have oaky flavors or a thick texture. It has refreshing acidity, subtle apple and spice notes and a palate-cleansing texture. Fine enough and subtle enough to drink frequently."
Muscat,Canada,British Columbia,Township 7,18.0,91.0,"With its intense scents and flavors of orange candy, Muscat is often made in a sweet style, but here it shows its dry side, and to good effect. Bright and penetrating scents and flavors hit on the entire spectrum of oranges, with excellent weight, precision and concentration. A touch of candied ginger adds further interest."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,18.0,91.0,"Still firm and structured, this pure Malbec wine is rich and tannic. At the same time, it has layers of ripe black fruits that are coming through strongly. The smoky, textured character of this wine comes from the wood aging that has added an extra layer. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,J. Scott Cellars,18.0,91.0,"With its vinicultural eye on New Zealand, this full-bodied and rich wine offers a mouth-filling mix of citrus and tropical fruits. It's lush and forward, dense with fruit and highlighted with lemon verbena. The overall effect is like sipping on a vinous lemon-drop cocktail. Quite delicious!"
Garnacha,US,California,Bokisch,18.0,91.0,"This has 10% Monastrell in the mix, and it is a sublime example of what flavors of baked raspberry compote, cranberry and black licorice can do when allowed to mingle together in liquid form. Medium in body, this has a lot of earthiness. It would make a fine alternative to more expensive Pinots."
Riesling,US,New York,Silver Thread,18.0,91.0,"This perfumed Riesling entices with lifted white floral notes against a backdrop of cool, foresty green notes. It's forward and juicy, boasting honeyed yellow peach and apricot flavors. Yet it's also elegantly structured, marked by zesty citrus notes and a cool, mineral finish that lingers endlessly. Drink now–2020."
Monastrell,Spain,Levante,Montgó,18.0,91.0,"Dusty, earthy plum and cherry aromas are a bit scratchy but enjoyable and powerful. A smooth, plummy palate entertains flavors of toasty black fruits and peppery spice, while the finish is meaty and full, with easy tannins. Drink through 2017."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Wit's End,18.0,91.0,"A splash of Barbera enlivens this wine, which boasts boysenberry, understated earthy notes and a dash of vanilla. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 10 years of ageability."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Vignoble de la Jarnoterie,18.0,91.0,"While still young, this wine has a smooth texture that shows the black fruits and perfumed tannins well. The balance of acidity and rich fruitiness is underpinned by the drier, tannic core. Drink young and fruity, but better wait until 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Leyda Valley,O. Fournier,18.0,91.0,"When O. Fournier tackles a new project, such as Sauvignon Blanc from Leyda, it doesn't mess around. This is an excellent example of Chilean SB with green fruit, citrus and a light touch of capsicum. It's a serious wine that challenges with its peppery crispness offset by grapefruit and green melon. Very nice mouthfeel; shows itself in a couple of waves."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Kühling-Gillot,18.0,91.0,"Dusty pollen and mineral tones lend austerity and elegance to zesty orange peel and lemon flavors in this dry, bracing Riesling. While light bodied and spry, it's surprisingly persistent on the finish. Ends on a delicate floral note."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,Upper Five,18.0,91.0,"Bright and polished, this low-alcohol wine is rounded off—to good effect—with some noticeable residual sugar. It's a luscious wine, loaded with grapefruit, lime and Meyer lemon flavors. They carry through a mouthfilling and palate-refreshing middle into a lingering finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,18.0,91.0,"Intense and rich wine, with touches of smoky wood, the tannins ripe, the acidity a refreshing balancing factor. With its cherry character, there is fruit already, but wait a year and this will be impressive."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Love & Squalor,18.0,91.0,"Biodynamically-farmed, old vine fruit from the Eola Hills vineyard is the source. The wine is forward and tangy, with a Vouvray-like sweet/sour character. It could be Chenin Blanc, only just a bit lighter, but with the same tart and tasty mix of acid and sugar, with lemony fruit and floral highlights. Really tasty."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Flichman,18.0,91.0,"Initially this Malbec-led blend is reduced, but with airing minerality and concentrated aromas of jammy berry fruits and latex win out. This is packed, ripe and stacked on the palate. Flavors of ripe black fruits, licorice, pepper and berry preserves finish spicy, peppery and with a note of chocolate. Drink through 2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,J.M. da Fonseca and Van Zeller,18.0,91.0,"This is the last vintage of a joint venture between J M da Fonseca and Cristiano van Zeller (the 2005 is a solo production by J M da Fonseca). It's a dry, dark, structured wine, with some minerality, full of ripe black plums and concentrated tannins."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Flichman,18.0,91.0,"Hulking, oaky aromas include spice, sandalwood and loads of ripe black fruit. This is massive in the mouth but sturdy and not overbearing. Flavors of baked berry and cassis are meaty, while the finish offers up licorice, spice and tons of density and concentration. Drink through 2019."
Red Blend,Greece,Florina,Alpha Estate,18.0,91.0,"Vanilla, black cherry and cinnamon on the nose lead the aromas of this exotic red. On the palate, a good red fruit and spice balance offers layers of cherry, plum and cedar. Likeable and a good introduction to Xinomavro."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider,18.0,91.0,"Hints of pine frond, earth and smoke entice on the nose of this unusual, remarkably well-priced Riesling. Semi-sweet in style, it's rich and creamy on the palate with luscious peach and grapefruit flavors. It's surprising nuanced too, exposing layers of steel, crushed mineral and acid that meld beautifully through a long finish."
Pinot Blanc,US,California,J Wilkes,18.0,91.0,"This is a very accessible white wine for those seeking a reliable alternative that's both bright and flavorful. Aromas of coconut, poached pear, chamomile and white flowers show on the broadly painted nose, while the palate is clean and crisp with apple, zippy acidity and a chalky minerality."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Balletto,18.0,91.0,High-toned citrus is kept fresh and alive by this wine's core of stony minerality. It's further buoyed by floral undertones and an overall sense of lightness.
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Bernard Baudry,18.0,91.0,"A beautifully perfumed wine with red berries and a ripe and rich texture. Its fruitiness is a part of a complex structure of dusty tannins, layers of wood and intense acidity. The combination of the elements offers a wine that will age for several years."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ancient Peaks,18.0,91.0,"Smoked meats, concentrated blackberrry and blueberry and a heavily peppered spice character shows on the nose of this bottling, with some dark chocolate for good measure. The tasty smoke invades the palate too, but there's also gingerbread cake, baked black plum, cocoa and baking spices. It offers solid acidity and decent structure too."
Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Louis Max,18.0,91.0,"Opulent and ripe, this wine has fine tannins that support the rich red fruit and smoky acidity. The weight and concentration of the wine make it so attractive and indicate it will develop well. Drink from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,91.0,"With six months of oak aging, this wine has both richness and spicy concentration. It is densely structured and solid with tannins. The black fruits are spreading through the wine, giving another element of richness. Dark and dense, the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,Thirsty Owl Wine Company,18.0,91.0,"Lavish violet perfume introduces this demure yet luminous Pinot Noir. Crisp black cherry and berry flavors are full of tartness and vibe, yet edged by soft tones of toast and earth, along with a fine frame of tannins. The finish meanders beautifully. It's ready to drink now but should continue to drink well until at least 2023."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Balletto,18.0,91.0,"From one of the few producers to grow and make this variety in the appellation, this was fermented in both neutral oak and stainless steel. It's focused and viscous, with a tropical opening of Tahitian vanilla built around white peach, lemony acidity and a fresh, crisp texture."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Les Vignerons de Tavel,18.0,91.0,"The cave cooperative in Tavel is hitting on all cylinders, turning out numerous consistent, top-rated examples. Différent doesn't have the spicy nuances of the very best Tavels, but it offers a bold, ripe mouthful of raspberry and cherry fruit, ample weight and richness and a long, slightly dusty-textured finish. Drink now–2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Stargazer Barn,18.0,91.0,"This elegant wine, one of very few brands from Humboldt County, strikes a good balance between a ripe, delicious fruit character and moderately spicy, buttery themes, without the influence of oak. Good, tangy acidity supports the flavors of vanilla, Anjou pear, and marzipan that come out first in the aroma and then spread to the palate."
Syrah,US,California,Andrew Murray,18.0,91.0,"The approachable nose of this wine shows baked blackberry pie in vanilla crust, with touches of dried purple flowers. The palate is similarly crowd-pleasing, with dark berry and baking spice flavors given intriguing depth through hints of game and rosemary."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tanesse,18.0,91.0,"Balanced and ripe, this is a rich wine. Its tannins and dark chocolate and wood flavors are deliciously balanced by ripe black fruit. It's concentrated and dense and will age well. Drink from 2021."
Rosé,US,California,Brander,18.0,91.0,"This pink blend of 66% Merlot and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon simply stood heads above other roses in its flight. Light plum and strawberry juice aromas meet with yeastyness on the nose, while the palate combines a prominent acidity with an extremely chalky mouthfeel. Light raspberry, bubblegum and squeezed mandarin flavors complete the experience."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Il Colombaio di Santa Chiara,18.0,91.0,"Made with organically cultivated grapes, this savory white offers alluring aromas of yellow stone fruit, pear and white spring flower. Juicy and delicious, the creamy palate doles out succulent yellow peach, golden apple, nectarine and a savory saline note. Tangy acidity lifts the creamy flavors while a hint of white almond graces the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,91.0,This terrific wine has vibrant fruit flavors and feelings of focus and energy on the palate. Firm acidity and fine-grained tannins add structure and lend support to the spicy oak and ripe cherry and blackberry nuances that start in the aromas and carry through the taste and finish.
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,18.0,91.0,"An excellent Zin—this has an invitingly soft floral nose, mountainous black-fruit flavors and structure and plenty of depth. This should age nicely over the next 3–5 years, but it is delicious to drink now, too."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,18.0,91.0,"Smoke and slate extend from nose to finish on this intensely mineral dry Riesling. On the palate, flavors of pristine white grapefruit and waxy lemons penetrate deeply, finishing long with a bracing crush of lime and salt."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine les Grands Presbytères,18.0,91.0,"The flinty soil of the area of Saint-Fiacre gives a strongly mineral character to this wine. Coming from old vines with an average age of 40-years-old, it is just mature, rich and with great complexity. It is a fine wine, ready to drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Villa Maria,18.0,91.0,"Round and ample in the mouth, this medium-full-bodied wine combines green notes of cut grass and snap pea with ripe stone fruit, then ends crisp and grapefruity. It's a fine example of Marlborough Sauvignon that's widely available and well priced."
Chardonnay,Australia,South Australia,Sidewood,18.0,91.0,"this is a lovely effort and a great value from Sidewood in the Adelaide Hills. Grilled peaches provide the flesh, while a bright, citrusy note adds focus and length to this ripe, rich Chardonnay. Drink now–2020."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Pendulum,18.0,91.0,"A kitchen-sink blend of varieties with Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (26%) taking the lead, this wine offers appealing aromas that suggest high-toned, sweet barrel spices, plum and herbs. It's loaded with cranberry, cherry and plum flavors with a rich mouthfeel that keeps the interest high."
Zweigelt,Austria,Niederösterreich,Steininger,18.0,91.0,"This comes across as so light, friendly and easy to drink that one almost forgets to note the outstanding purity of fruit. Fresh cherries and blueberries present themselves honestly. Silky tannins and a spicy aftertaste suggest that it took top-quality fruit and lots of experience to make something so deceptively simple."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Casa do Valle,18.0,91.0,"This is a bold wine, full of ripe apple and peach fruit flavors. It is delicious, juicy with a tight texture and zesty acidity. There is an opulent, rich aftertaste that is mouth-filling and perfumed. The wine is ready to drink now although it will be better from 2017."
Riesling,US,Washington,Sparkman,18.0,91.0,"After starting out a touch reduced, this wine opens to reveal aromas of wet rock, high-toned white flowers, lime and green apple. The palate is broad and dry, with generous citrus flavors that linger."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,18.0,91.0,"Crystal clear, loaded with enticing aromas and flavors of lemon zest, orange, tangerine and spice, this is a juicy, delicious and complete wine. Tangy and tart, it is almost impossible not to drain the glass quickly in order to refill it."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Gadais Père et Fils,18.0,91.0,"This ripe, fresh wine packs a punch of fruit. It's well structured and lightly mineral at the back. Swathes of apple, citrus and pink grapefruit occupy the foreground of this impressive wine that is ready for drinking."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,J. Scott Cellars,18.0,91.0,"The winery does well with this grape, though each new vintage brings some sort of a twist or turn as far as grape sourcing, blend and overall style are concerned. Pungent with fusel oil and grass, it's not for the faint of palate. Full and flavorful on the palate, it combines sweet grasses with tree fruits, citrus and rind, showing excellent concentration and length, and finishing with a hint of ginger cookie."
Sauvignon Blanc,Canada,British Columbia,Township 7,18.0,91.0,"Opening with classic peavine aromas, this is a bright, fleshy and pungent wine that should delight fans of Loire Valley-style Sauvignon Blancs. Rich, cascading flavors of fig, pear, grapefruit and star fruit keep the mouthfeel lively. Just 10% was barrel-fermented, the rest in stainless."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,18.0,91.0,"Smoke accents ripe yellow peaches on the nose of this intensely penetrating kabinett. The palate shocks with luscious mango and melon flavors, layered with bristling mineral accents. It finishes long, with a reverberating astringency."
Castelão,Portugal,Palmela,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,91.0,"Castelão thrives in the sandy soils of the Palmela appellation. This reserve wine from 60-year-old vines with 12 months in wood is a rich, structured example. It's full bodied and ripe, packed with black plum fruit and acidity. Still young, it's ready to drink but will be better from 2018."
Viognier-Roussanne,US,California,Atrea,18.0,91.0,"Ripe fruit flavors and a gorgeously rich texture make this full-bodied wine difficult to resist. It smells like Pippin apples and toasted almonds, tastes more like Bosc pears with a layer of cream on top, yet it's dry and well balanced."
Zweigelt,Austria,Burgenland,Markus Altenburger,18.0,91.0,"A very fresh-faced, fun Zweigelt, this shows off wonderfully crunchy cherry fruit on an equally crunchy palate, as well as a palpable tannic structure. If you want to wow your friends at a picnic or outdoor meal, this has the necessary rustic readiness. It could even do with some chilling in summer."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,King Estate,18.0,91.0,"Succulent, juicy fruit flavors combine lemon drop and butterscotch hard candy, buttressed with vivid acidity. This irresistible wine is drinking beautifully already."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Paul Blanck,18.0,91.0,"Ripeness and generosity of pure pear flavors characterize nose and palate. There is concentration on the palate and both juicy ripeness and zesty freshness, creating a lively fruit-driven wine. The finish is long and appetizing."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,18.0,91.0,"The nose gives appetizing glimpses of pure ripe juicy pear. These flavors blossom fully on the palate and leave a most harmonious picture of ample, dry, but well-expressed pear fruit with lovely freshness. Everything here happens with ease. The finish is pure and fresh."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,91.0,"This is a juicy, dense wine from João Silva e Sousa and Francisco Baptista that is packed with dark, steely tannins. A field blend of 10 Douro red varieties, with 12 months of wood aging, it's ripe in sweet, rich red fruits that are balanced by intense acidity. Still young, the wine will be better from 2017."
Merlot,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,18.0,91.0,"A sensational value, the grapes come from top vineyards that generally command high prices. Tobacco and cherry scents roll smoothly into a rich, dense palate loaded with kirsch, crème de cassis and framboise flavors. The fruit is concentrated, sappy and deep."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Houchart,18.0,91.0,"This wine from Houchart's selective Sainte-Victoire appellation is distinct from the Quiot family's other Houchart rosés. This wine is rich and full on the palate, without losing any sense of acidity or freshness. It's ready to drink although it will be better from the end of 2015."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Château du Carrubier,18.0,91.0,"This is a dark-hued wine, full of tannins as well as rich black-currant fruits. It is densely textured with a strong herbal mineral character. Acidity and spiciness come with a firm edge that suggests this young wine will age further. Drink from 2019."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Jim Barry,18.0,91.0,"This fits the mold of Clare Valley Riesling perfectly. Struck flint notes give way to bright citrus on the nose, followed up by pineapple, cardamom and cinnamon flavors. It's dry to the point of austerity, framed by a slightly dusty texture, yet boasts mouthwatering acids on the long finish. Drink now–2025, possibly longer."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Quinta de Paços,18.0,91.0,"From a single vineyard in the Vinho Verde sub-region of Monção and Melgaço, the heartland of Alvarinho, the wine is rich and smoothly textured. It has a fine creamy character that is filled with ripe pear and apricot fruits. The more citrus acidity is just right to balance this richness. Drink now."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Holman Ranch,18.0,91.0,"Monterey Bay fog cools this vineyard at the appellation's northeastern tip. The acidity shines on this bottling, with refreshing aromas that are both ripe with honeydew melon and stark with grass and nectarine. Lime zest and yellow grapefruit spray power the nearly sour palate, making a perfect pairing for oysters and light cheese plates."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,18.0,91.0,"A touch of flinty reduction colors the nose, showing how young this wine still is. The palate, however, is fresh and sprightly in shape, but totally rich and concentrated in flavor. Svelte generosity shows in the very fluid midpalate texture and a lasting lemon finish."
Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,US,Washington,Cloudlift Cellars,18.0,91.0,"Updraft is two thirds Sauvignon Blanc and one third Semillon, barrel-fermented. Full-bodied and fleshy, it's bursting with ripe yellow fruits, along with apricot and papaya. On the tropical edge, but focused and lightly toasty, as you'd find in a Bordeaux."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,18.0,91.0,"Partly wood aged, this wine is conceived as the essence of Malbec. With its concentrated black fruits and firm tannins, it is dense and needs to age. There is a core that is firmly structured—rich and still surrounded by youthful fruitiness. Drink from 2019."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Volpe Pasini,18.0,91.0,"This tremendous wine is 100% Pinot Grigio, of which 50% was aged in new wood. It is rich and full-bodied, with complex layers of vanilla. It comes from low-yielding, old vines. Only 8,000 bottles were produced."
White Blend,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Anselmi,18.0,91.0,"Roberto Anselmi has quit the Soave DOC, but continues to make some of the best wines in the area. This is full of ripe and light acidity, aromas of spring flowers and fresh garden scents and a finish of aniseed and almonds."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,18.0,91.0,"Heady notes of lychee dominate nose and palate. The mouthfeel is plump and rounded with a slick oiliness. With more air, some tangerine peel makes itself felt and stays pleasingly on the dreamy finish. Notions of candied tangerine linger long after the last sip."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,18.0,91.0,"Mellow Golden Delicious fruit is tempered by bright, lemony acidity that shines a light on more subtle notes of orange flesh and tangerine. The mouthfeel and the lingering edges are shot through with an almost textural zestiness. This is lovely, fruit-driven, bright and dry."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Nozières,18.0,91.0,"A smooth wine, the tannins suspended within a velvet texture, resulting in an opulent, rich feel. This is very intense, with medicinal and dark plum skin flavors. Powerful, solid, for aging."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Morgadío,18.0,91.0,"Aromas of melon, lime and stream water are just right. This has a crystal clear sense of freshness to the palate along with lime, peach and melon flavors that coast on fine acidity and finish in refreshing fashion."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Ricardo Santos,18.0,91.0,"There is a select group of under-$20 Malbecs from Argentina that really do the country and the variety proud. Santos is one of them; the 2006 is easy and ripe on the nose, with lovely cola, berry and herb aromas. The palate has a natural feel and bright black-fruit flavors. Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Riotor,17.0,91.0,"Produced by the owners of Châteauneuf-du-Pape estate Château Mont-Redon, this is a full and fruity wine. It has a good balance between acidity and red berry fruits that give a rich character. Packed with flavor, it's ready to drink."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Landaluce,17.0,91.0,"Fresh, pure berry aromas don't mess around. This fruit-forward Crianza is mouth-filling and borders on lush. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry, pepper and spice finish solid as a rock, with length and a confirming sense of quality."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Les Frères Couillaud,17.0,91.0,"One year's lees aging has softened this wine and given it great richness. It is a rounded and opulent wine, deliciously ripe and full of bold, mouth-filling fruit."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,17.0,91.0,"The nose is very shy, giving little away apart from slight citrus. Everything happens on the palate, with tender but ripe pear fruit gently edged with zesty citrus. A tingle of white pepper along the lemon peel creates a vividly fresh but light wine. It's clean and totally refreshing, with a long finish."
Riesling,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,17.0,91.0,"Lemon and lime are just hinted at on the restrained nose. On the palate they are joined by friendly, juicy stone-fruit notes of ripe yellow Mirabelle plum. The palate is dry, light and juicy, with a delicate stature that leads to a zesty citrus finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Peyrabon,17.0,91.0,"Owned by the Bernard family who also own one of the major Bordeaux negociants, Millésima, the wine is structured, deliciously fruity and with a series of smoky tannins that will allow it to age. It comes from a vineyard close to Pauillac and that shows in the dense Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its weight. Drink from 2021."
Red Blend,Italy,Southern Italy,Leone de Castris,17.0,91.0,"Aromas of ripe dark berry, exotic spice, tobacco and an anise note lead the nose on this intense wine. The succulent palate delivers layers of blackberry, raspberry, clove, licorice and allspice. Tightly-knit but velvety tannins provide support."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Wakefield,17.0,91.0,"This winery was originally developed as a Cabernet specialist, and the regular 2012 bottling is another fine success. Briery, herbal shadings frame blackberry fruit, while the finish features a mouthwatering combination of mocha, dark fruit and lingering tannins. Drink this medium-bodied Cabernet now through 2025."
Gros Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine du Tariquet,17.0,91.0,"Lightly honeyed, this off-dry wine is complex while also fruity. Intense flavor fills the mouth with spice, yellow fruits, pineapple and a touch of mango. The fruits are balanced by the more nuanced honey and spice character that is finished with acidity. Gros Manseng, a native grape of this region, is worth getting to know. Drink this delicious wine from 2016."
Zinfandel,US,California,Murphy-Goode,17.0,91.0,"Toasty nose, bright fruit, makes for a classy, creamy, zippy Zin. This is really a pleasure, balanced and forward and full of life. There are some nuances of tar and spice in a balanced, exceptionally lively, seductive wine."
Zinfandel,US,California,Lake Sonoma,17.0,91.0,"Fat fruit, juicy and ripe, brimming with wonderful fruit flavors. The wine is unctuous, sinfully lush, and still balanced with berries and spice and some good toasty oak. Young and hard, but good stuff with a nice life ahead."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Marangona,17.0,91.0,"Enticing wildflower, chopped herb and ripe orchard fruit scents abound in this radiant wine. The palate doles out white peach, yellow pear and nectarine notes, with stony mineral accents. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Véronique Günther-Chereau,17.0,91.0,"Creamed apple aromas shine out of this intensely fruity wine. With its ripe pear and melon flavors and the concentration from the old vines, the wine is rich while keeping plenty of acidity in reserve. Its fruit is still young, still perfumed. The wine is ready to drink."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Wakefield,17.0,91.0,"Taylor's (marketed as Wakefield internationally) seems to be on a roll. This is a complex, multidimensional Shiraz laced with nuances ranging from mulberry and plum to meat and spice and on to coffee and black olive. It's medium-bodied, with tannins that are supple enough to make it approachable right away."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Dupré,17.0,91.0,"Using fruit sourced from 94-year-old vines, this is a powerful and concentrated wine. It has a serious, complex mix of fruit and tannin, with notes of leather and spice that lend power and density. Age this for at least another year."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Bodkin,17.0,91.0,"Fans of Sancerre will love this complex, lean and lively Sauvignon. The color is a light straw-yellow and aromas recall grapefruit and lime. Flavors of bright, tangy citrus continue on the palate, with a note of white pepper. The snappy balance and lithe texture keeps everything echoing on the finish."
Riesling,Australia,Western Australia,Robert Oatley,17.0,91.0,"This is a bit rounder and richer than many Australian Rieslings, with pronounced weight and rich texture on the palate. Instead of lime, it delivers orange blossom and orange sherbet notes that linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Nautilus,17.0,91.0,"Winemaker Clive Jones has been steadily improving the wines at Nautilus, and the 2010 Sauvignon Blanc may be his best yet. Leafy, capsicum notes arise on the nose and persist through the finish, backed with just enough grapefruit to see them through. Lithe and refreshing."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,17.0,91.0,"A staple of California winemaking, this vintage is as good as ever—perfectly polished, with light aromas of toasted oak and crisp green apple, lemon-lime and tempting butter flavors, and a medium-bodied frame. The texture is silky smooth, and everything tastes harmonious and balanced."
Red Blend,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,17.0,91.0,"Cherry and pepper are the hallmarks of Zweigelt. Here, they are very aromatic: While muted on the nose, the palate is fresh, lively and very authentic. Merlot adds riper fruit while Blaufränkisch contributes more pepper and structure. This is a very harmonious blend. Lovely now but with the mileage to last a number of years in the cellar. Aromatic cherry fruit echoes on the palate. Drink now until 2020."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,André Kientzler,17.0,91.0,"Notes of ripe Russet pear dominate nose and palate. The fresh body gives full rein to these ample lively fruit flavors. Zesty tangy freshness counters the full fruit and creates a lively, harmonious, moreish and refreshing wine. The finish is dry."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Cueva de las Manos,17.0,91.0,"Opaque in color, this saturated Malbec-led blend exhibits coconut and cola aromas along with fully ripe blackberry notes. This is massive in the mouth, with a solid foundation. Maximum berry expression and a jammy, deep-fruited finish give this power and content beyond its price point."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,David Hill,17.0,91.0,"Though low in alcohol even by David Hill standards, this excellent Pinot Gris does not lack fruit or flavor. Ripe and tasting of pretty pear and orange fruit, it shows evidence of some well-balanced residual sugar. Vivid acidity cuts through to a satisfying finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,New South Wales,Nugan Family Estates,17.0,91.0,"Despite coming from a warm, inland region, this shows admirable freshness. Cassis, vanilla, some red-fruit tones and baking spices all come together harmoniously on the medium-bodied palate. It's restrained yet intense, with a long, silky finish. Drink now–2025."
Viognier,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,17.0,91.0,"On top of being made from organically grown grapes, this wine is vegan friendly. Of course, that means nothing unless the wine is good. Thankfully, this wine is excellent. Apricot, honey and ginger notes mingle easily on the palate. Drink this full-bodied, slightly open-knit wine over through 2017."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Ponzi,17.0,91.0,"This leesy and creamy yet bracing wine reveals abundant melon, citrus and pear fruit flavors. Balance and finesse are on full display, as always the case in Luisa Ponzi's wines."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Van Ruiten,17.0,91.0,"This abundantly rich wine seems to melt in the mouth like fine dark chocolate. Aromas emphasize fully ripe plums, black cherries and a whiff of spicy oak. Then chocolaty flavors expand quickly on the tongue as they are carried by copious soft tannins. While big in flavor it's modest in body and alcohol."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,West Cape Howe,17.0,91.0,"Sourced from Mount Barker, this is a full-bodied, supple example of WA Shiraz. Concentrated plummy fruit is marked by hints of menthol and peppery spice, then ends in a soft wash of dusty tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink now–2020+."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Huia,17.0,91.0,"The husband-and-wife team of Mike and Claire Allen have turned out 2,000 cases of this terrific value, which delivers authentic Pinot Noir complexity at an attractive price. Bold black cherry fruit carries subtle herb, twig and vanilla shadings with aplomb, while the texture turns velvety on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2017."
Pinot Gris,US,Washington,Convergence Zone,17.0,91.0,"The first Washington wine to be released from the 2011 vintage hits the ground running, with ripe, round, rich flavors of honeyed pears and peaches. Succulent and fruity, it cuts its sharp acidity with 2% residual sugar, making for a wine with fine concentration and length."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Cristom,17.0,91.0,"A tart and beautifully-defined mix of apple and pear fruit, with a steely spine and dappled baking spices. Excellent balance and mouthfeel, with a finishing mineral note."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Hubert Meyer,17.0,91.0,"This is ripe and smooth, with a generous creamy texture. Spice and apple combine to give a tangy edge that will soften and integrate as the wine ages. It's full of potential. Drink from 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,17.0,91.0,"Delicious, almost sweet fruit flavors are wrapped in firm, velvety tannins for a seriously enjoyable experience. There's a feeling of polish in the texture, and careful balance between full body, good tannin structure and lively acidity."
Red Blend,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,17.0,91.0,"A wonderfully herbal lift of mint precedes ripe cherry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate brims with lusciously ripe plum, while supple tannins provide a velvety but firm background against which the mellow fruit can play. It's fresh, juicy and full-bodied."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Houchart,17.0,91.0,"This rich wine comes from the sheltered vineyards close to Mount Sainte-Victoire. The weight of the ripe fruit gives a full-bodied style with both acidity and a spicy, peppery character. This is a wine to hold for a few months and drink from late 2017."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Pieropan,17.0,91.0,"Fragrances recall honeysuckle, jasmine and citrus zest. The juicy palate offers creamy green apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine alongside zesty acidity. A note of white almond signals the close."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Apex,17.0,91.0,"This opens with enticing aromas of toasted hazelnut, Key lime and white peach. The firm, controlled palate is concentrated and long, offering vivid, precise fruit and a tasty hint of skin phenolics."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Château Riotor,17.0,91.0,"Made by the Abeille family of Château Mont-Redon in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this striking, peppery, spicy wine is rich with a fine texture as well as plenty of red berry fruits. It is a concentrated wine, very dry and likely to be much better with food."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,King Estate,17.0,91.0,"There's extra richness across the palate of perfectly ripened apple, pear and melon fruit. The weight of the wine in the mouth is substantial but maintains a sense of lightness and proportion, and the finish extends out gracefully as long as you can wait for that next sip."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,France Other,Guillaume Gros,17.0,91.0,"The blend is 70% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 10% Carignan, and in 2009 the grapes were as ripe as they could be. Mocha and chocolate notes pick up a touch of prune. With its superripe fruit, ample weight, lush texture and warm finish, there are valid concerns about its ageability, but this offers hedonistic drinking for an affordable price."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,17.0,91.0,"Soft and tenderly fragrant fruit hovers above a palate dominated by Golden Delicious apple flavors and an almost soy-like, savory edge that makes you want to drink more. A seam of lemony freshness brightens up everything and lasts well after the last sip. This is a truly lovely, understated Riesling."
Red Blend,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,17.0,91.0,"A big, bold wine that also tastes precise and structured, it has deep, dense fruit flavors like black currant and black cherry, layers of fine tannins, hints of dark chocolate and espresso. This is a great wine to stash in the cellar, as it will taste best after 2020."
Riesling,US,Washington,Elevation Cellars,17.0,91.0,"Sourced from the excellent Lawrence Vineyard, this checks out as dry on the official Riesling scale, posted on the back label. It's yeasty and rich in the mouth, with lightly honeyed fruit flavors of lemon curd, candied orange peel, key lime and guava."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,17.0,91.0,"This is a tasty and accessibly priced Chardonnay. It packs in lots of fruit flavor, vibrant acidity, rich texture and layers of oaky spice while showing a rare sense of seamlessness. Very Californian and compelling."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Tilleuls,17.0,91.0,"It's the old vines that are behind the concentration of this wine. It is rich, tight and dry with a really crisp texture and strong minerality. The acidity and the great lemon and grapefruit flavors are delicious and refreshing. Give this wine another few months for the best effect and drink from 2018."
Rosé,Austria,Niederösterreich,Schloss Gobelsburg,17.0,91.0,"Restraint, elegance, freshness. This delicate rosé has the softest scent of tart summer berries and overtones of rose petals. There is a spicier aspect and fruitier notes of freshly cut apple on the midpalate. But this delivers full flavor with immense delicacy. Bravo."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,Umani Ronchi,17.0,91.0,"Aromas that recall jasmine, green apple and honeydew melon lead the nose. The juicy, medium-bodied palate has good weight and concentration, offering tangerine, ripe pear, bitter almond and a hint of banana. Bright acidity offsets the rich flavors while a ginger note closes the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Black Saint Peter,17.0,91.0,"An earthy, black-pepper aroma and classic blackberry, raspberry and brambly spice components make this a fine example of Zinfandel. It is full bodied, mouthfilling and generous in flavor, benefitting from good acidity and moderate, fine-grained tannins for structure."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Garciarévalo,17.0,91.0,"Fine Verdejo is more elusive than one might think. And Tres Olmos is that rare wine that smells great, tastes just right, and lingers for a long time on your teased and tested palate. Almond, pear and citrus aromas smartly give way to a smooth wave of blended citrus fruits. The finish is long and confident. Drink now."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Marangona,17.0,91.0,"Showing breeding and class, this opens with aromas of tropical fruit, white peach and citrus that all carry over to the palate. The creamy texture and juicy fruit are balanced by crisp acidity."
Red Blend,Australia,Australia Other,Insurrection,17.0,91.0,"This is full-bodied, velvety-textured and expansive in the mouth, delivering plenty of bold cassis, chocolate and sage flavors. Some brighter, red-fruit notes mingle with mocha shadings on the surprisingly long finish."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Wakefield,17.0,91.0,"This is a classically styled Clare Riesling, from its hints of talcum powder, green apple and lime to its precise line and crisp finish. It's dry and undeniably tart and citrusy—perfect for aging 4–8 years."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Hans und Christine,17.0,91.0,"The Edelgrund vineyard, along the northern slopes of Lake Neusiedl gives a powerful, structured wine. It layers dark tannins, an initially stern mineral character that needs time to soften. At the same time, the juicy black fruits and tight acidity offer a more fruity aspect. Keep for 4–5 years. Screwcap."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Lucien Lardy,17.0,91.0,"This is juicy, full of red-berry flavors that are balanced with attractive tannins and acidity. It has some concentration from the old vines, planted in 1951, that gives the wine considerable depth and richness. This is one of those Beaujolais that could age through 2022, although it's very drinkable now."
Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Petit Clocher,17.0,91.0,"This blend dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon comes from schist soil on the plateau above the Loire river. It benefits from a warm vintage to give a rich character as well as some firm tannins. The balance between fruit and structure is just right. Although the wine is young, it will mature quickly, so drink from 2019."
Monastrell,Spain,Levante,Volver,17.0,91.0,"Punchy black-cherry and plum aromas are dry, earthy and toasty, with stony minerality and crispness. This is a full, lively, generous Monastrell offering blackberry, spiced cake and chocolate flavors over a dark, coffee-laden finish that goes the distance. Drink through 2018."
Riesling,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,17.0,91.0,"This generously fruited but slender Riesling is a study in subtlety: everything is there: ripe Mirabelle plums, zesty lemon peel and a wonderful interplay of the two on the concentrated palate. Yet nothing is big or bold. Listen and you will be rewarded."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Quivira,17.0,91.0,"Made in a style that will appeal to fans of both creamy, fruity richness and more austere notes of fresh grass, this wine is dry, herbal and juicy. It offers accents of vanilla and white plum, as well as the aforementioned fruitiness of peach and pear."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Croix Saint-Pierre,17.0,91.0,"This bold, ripe wine is full of tannins as well as great fruit. Juicy with black currant flavors, smoky from wood aging and rich with tannins, it's finely structured and ready to mature gently. Drink from 2021."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,17.0,91.0,"An aromatic wine with great depth, this is complex and concentrated. It brings out a great tangy, zesty, steely character that has freshness as well as richness in equal measure. White fruits and red currants leave a crisp, taut aftertaste."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,Umani Ronchi,17.0,91.0,"Notes of hawthorne, acacia and tropical fruit open this quintessential expression of Verdicchio. The fresh, juicy palate is loaded with pineapple, creamy white peach and lemon custard flavors, accented by hints of balsamic herbs and ocean-like salinity. Energizing mineral adds to the depth. Hold for 2–3 years to develop complexity or enjoy now for the fruit purity."
Riesling,US,New York,Hermann J. Wiemer,17.0,91.0,"Whiffs of crushed mineral and candle wax lend mineral intensity to crisp, concentrated green plum and honeydew flavors in this semi-dry Riesling. Lime acidity cuts through the midpalate, leading into a long, slightly floral finish. Year after year, it's an exceptional bargain wine of consistent value."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Pontoise Cabarrus,17.0,91.0,"This is a powerfully tannic wine from a blend of equal proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with a serious touch of Petit Verdot. It is dark in color, dense in texture although with no hint of toughness. Instead, it is a rich wine that will age well. Drink from 2023."
Gewürztraminer,Canada,British Columbia,Tinhorn Creek,17.0,91.0,"Bursting with floral aromas, this loads the palate with flavors of rose petals, lychee, grapefruit and spice. Finishing dry, it has outstanding concentration, tension and length."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Rodney Strong,17.0,91.0,"A strong whiff of oak opens this wine before blowing off to reveal complementary aromas and flavors of mango, peach and melon accented by fresh-cut grass and honeysuckle. Mostly stainless-steel fermented, with just 10% of the wine given time in barrel, it remains crisp and clean, with just the right amount of texture and body."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Wines & Winemakers,17.0,91.0,"This rich, sophisticated wood-aged wine has complex fruits, structure and tannins. Ripe, juicy black fruits are intertwined with a solidly dry texture, powerful but still elegant. It will repay aging. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Seven Hills,17.0,91.0,"A glorious, grapefruity, lusciously fresh Pinot Gris, this new vintage from Seven Hills is made for a summer afternoon. This has notes of citrus and melon, with highlights of mint and a hint of pepper, keeping it lively and interesting all through the refreshing finish."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,17.0,91.0,"The wine's name comes from the Adour River that flows through the Madiran region. This is dark colored, powerful and spicy, with weight and richness that should allow this to age for at least four years."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Ancient Peaks,17.0,91.0,"This bottling shows off both sides of Sauvignon Blanc—at once lush and tropical and racy and crisp. Ripe Gala apple and Bosc pear aromas meet tart orange peel and rubber on the nose. The palate is bolstered by energetic acidity, with a stony texture and flavors of sour Granny Smith apple and yellow grapefruit."
White Blend,US,California,Tenshen,17.0,91.0,"Tropical fruit, white flower-flavored candies, aromatic heirloom apples and a touch of honey come into crystalline focus on this wine by Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi. Lime blossoms, Key lime crème fraîche and a touch of yogurt consume the energetic palate."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château de Brézé,17.0,91.0,"A ripe and honeyed wine, this is dry and with acidity along with fresh fruitiness. It's crisply textured, refreshingly perfumed and with delicious, pure apple flavors and acidity. It's a wine to drink now, although better to age until 2017."
Viognier,US,California,Calera,17.0,91.0,"The nose on Josh Jensen's latest vintage is expertly restrained, suggesting honey- and lemon-laced chamomile tea. The flavors are even and nicely arced, with tart lime moving into pear flesh and finishing with butter-scorched lemon and custard."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Recanati,17.0,91.0,"Dark red violet in color, this wine offers a nose of black cherry, brambles and violet. Teamwork between fruit and cool herb flavors is evident amid notes of red cherry, toffee, fennel bulb and mint. Mouth-coating tannins give way to a zest-laden finish."
Weissburgunder,Austria,Niederösterreich,Dürnberg,17.0,91.0,"This is a blend of Weissburgunder and Pinot Blanc that is aged in large barrels on the lees. It has a rich, creamy character with a delicate texture and generous acidity. The palate is apricot flavored but lightly peppery. Full in the mouth, it is ready to drink, but will improve over the next two years."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Gernot and Heike Heinrich,17.0,91.0,"Enticing scents of crushed strawberry, blackberry and wild huckleberry give aromatic direction to this brightly fruited, lively and slender red. The streak of freshness highlights the purity of the fruit even more. This is an ambitious wine with depth, yet without any heaviness—an intriguing alternative for Pinot-lovers."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,17.0,91.0,"The Indian Wells Chardonnay by this producer continues to improve with each vintage. Here, the melding of luscious tropical fruit with buttery barrel flavors is just about perfect. Pineapple, Meyer lemon and candied oranges highlight the intense flavors, and the lushly-applied oak influences carry the full-bodied wine to hold a smooth, satisfying finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Eichinger,17.0,91.0,"While still closed on the nose, this has hints of green and yellow pear that shine through. A slender but very appetizing juiciness on the palate is light but full of freshness and flavor. Yeast, aloe vera and herbal spice add even more pleasure. It's a gorgeous, refreshing wine from a challenging vintage."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Douro,Caves Velhas,17.0,91.0,"Full and ripe, this wine's dark plum fruit is lined with toast from the nine months it spent in new wood. It has a smooth, polished texture, and the finish bears sweet tannins and a touch of eucalyptus. Age this for 2–3 years."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,17.0,91.0,"Part of a Limited Release series, this is an all-stainless Chardonnay. Ripe, tart and focused, it offers spicy bursts of yellow and green fruits, and it shows a sur lie-derived texture. The pinpoint details are gorgeous."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,RouteStock,17.0,91.0,"A consistently great white, this vintage is as impressive as ever, exhibiting steely, rocky minerality around savory, smooth layers marked by light, pretty flavors of key lime and lemon peel."
Moschofilero,Greece,Mantinia,Tselepos,17.0,91.0,"This elegant wine typifies Moschofilero's alluring nature, with an opulent nose redolent of rose, violet and citrus, and fresh and elegant flavors of melon and lemon."
Gewürztraminer,Canada,British Columbia,Tinhorn Creek,17.0,91.0,"A standout among Tinhorn Creek's wide-ranging portfolio, this full-bodied wine offers a generous serving of the grape's signature floral aromatics and spices, but there's plenty of ripe fruit also. Citrus peel and candied ginger along with fleshy pear and lemongrass make this a fine choice for grilled shrimp."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Aigner,17.0,91.0,"An intriguing nose displays rustic earthiness, damp soil and ripe notes of banana and pineapple. The palate continues this incongruous yet delicious theme and impresses with a slender but concentrated body and toothsome texture. What a beauty."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Tritón,17.0,91.0,"Oaky aromas of wood grain, graphite, bacon, rubber and asphalt blend with ripe blackberry scents to create an inky, potent bouquet. This feels round and lush, with cutting lemony acidity. Flavors of baked blackberry, cassis and chocolate finish ripe, healthy and toasty. Drink through 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Montes,17.0,91.0,"Tight, pure blackberry and cassis aromas are composed. This is a better-balanced wine than the sticky, overly oaked 2012 version. Leading toasty chocolate flavors go well with secondary spiced berry and cassis notes. A note of vanilla comes out on the finish."
Rosé,US,Washington,Seven Hills,17.0,91.0,"Principally Cabernet Franc with small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec (8% each) blended in, this wine is almost irresistible with its pretty, pale salmon color. It does not disappoint with its aromas and flavors of melon, white peach and grapefruit, with a light spritz giving it some lift."
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,16.666666666666668,91.0,"A sensuous sweet Sherry, this has the full monty of fig, date, licorice, root beer and chocolate aromas and flavors. It's naturally thick and sweet but also balanced, so it doesn't come across like a spoonful of syrup. Great as a dessert wine with cake or blue cheese, but also as a topping for vanilla or coffee ice cream. Thick and potent on the nose, with aromas of prune, cola and fig. Feels dense and syrupy, with dulce de leche, cocoa and integrated citrus flavors. An unbridled winner with richness, length and raw value; how many $15 wines rank this high? Not many. Pure and intoxicating on the bouquet, with lush, primal aromas of molasses and raisin. So rich and black that you almost need a knife to get through it, but it's not sludge in a glass. There's fudge, cocoa and mocha on the finish, yet as a whole it's an upright sweet wine, not something pudgy and simple."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,16.666666666666668,91.0,"This is sweet Amontillado in fine form. The nose is centered around a core of molasses and brown sugar, while the palate bubbles with maple and toffee. Yes, it's a sweeter-styled Amontillado, but the sugar fades on the palate, leaving only the complex residue of caramel, espresso and burnt cinnamon. A lovely wine for any fan of serious Sherry. With a nose of toffee, dried apricot, cocoa powder and rancio, this is classic off-dry amontillado. It feels fresh and active, then tastes rich and moderately sweet, with flavors of hazelnut, caramel, toasted banana, orange and spice. Nutty and smooth on the finish. For affordable amontillado, this is downright excellent. Smells nutty and oily, maybe a touch sharp, but well within normal parameters. Feels fresh, round and comfortable, with lots of core fruit flavor, nuttiness, sweet toffee and caramel. Finishes with toasted pecan flavors and peanut butter notes. Semidry in style."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Weingut Liebfrauenstift,16.0,91.0,"Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling. While zesty and lithe in body, ripe grapefruit and melon flavors feel supple and silky on the palate. Drink now through 2019."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,16.0,91.0,"Superbly warm weather in 2015 gave an extra boost of sunshine to many of the Mosel's entry-level wines, and the RK is one of the best. Whiffs of freesia and tangerine peel waft from the glasss of this semidry Riesling. It's low in alcohol, yet so honeyed and ripe that flavors of grapefruit and peach seem to slick sumptuously on the palate. Zesty lime acidity freshens a lingering finish."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Ca' de Calle,16.0,91.0,"Clean, cedary and dynamic, with fine black-fruit aromas on the nose. The palate has a full, layered texture that impresses, while the flavors of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry carry toasty, dark, chocolaty accents. Savory and warm on the finish, with lots of power. A blend of 75% Malbec with 20% Tempranillo and 5% Syrah."
Zinfandel,US,California,Fidelity,16.0,91.0,"A small-production blend of 86% Zinfandel with 14% Petite Sirah, this was aged over a year in a small percentage of new oak. Dry and structured, it's a celebration of chocolate, leather and blackberry, the fruit sizably ripe yet kept in check. Drink now through 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Croix Saint-Pierre,16.0,91.0,"Big and juicy, this is an attractive blend of 70% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec with a promising future. It has ripe berry fruits, touches of spice and ginger. The tannins are firm, dusty and dry while allowing plenty of room for the fruit. It will develop well; drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,16.0,91.0,"It shows total citrus focus, linearity and precision, fringed by green pear peel and peppery leaves. Superior freshness and definite ageing potential show in the tingling, invigorating acidity."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Fontes da Cunha,16.0,91.0,"Ripe and fruity, this is a full-bodied, intense wine. It has citrus acidity as well as more tropical fruits, laden with wood. The whole is much more than the sum of the parts, giving a full, ripe and complex wine that will age."
Zinfandel,US,California,Seven Deadly Zins,16.0,91.0,"Savory pepper and grilled beef aromas make this wine appetizing, its rich berry and ripe plum flavors bringing excellent concentration and depth to the palate. It's big and bold, yet polished. Firm tannins interlacing with ripeness and spiciness to keep it balanced and help propel a lingering finish."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Melrose,16.0,91.0,"This captures all the ripe fruit and fresh mouthfeel you could ask for in a young Riesling. Succulent and peachy, with references to other mixed tree fruits, this also brings highlights of orange pekoe tea. Residual sugar is 20 g/L."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Olabarri,16.0,91.0,"Toasty, warm, charred aromas accent earthy, enticing plum and prune scents. This ripe, round, well-structured Rioja is moderately deep on the palate but also bouncy and elegant. Earthy baked-plum flavors come with leathery accents and savory oak, while the finish is lasting and balanced. Drink through 2018."
Lambrusco di Sorbara,Italy,Central Italy,Cleto Chiarli,16.0,91.0,"Violet, wild rose and woodland berry aromas lead the nose in this lively, polished and joyful wine. The lightly sparkling palate doles out red cherry, crushed strawberry, candied tangerine zest and ginger hints. Crisp acidity lends a clean, dry finish."
Port,Portugal,Port,Wiese & Krohn,16.0,91.0,"Mature, definitely dry in character, with attractive wood acidity. Dark gold in color, it has just enough sweetness, but the style is certainly a sipping Port, not a mixer, giving an intriguing finishing austerity."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Thurston Wolfe,16.0,91.0,"This is a broad, leafy, late harvest Zinfandel, augmented with a splash of brandy. Mellow cherry tobacco flavors saturate the palate, smooth and lingering, with a lick of vanilla and butterscotch as they weave through the finish."
Garnacha,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Ateca,16.0,91.0,"Emphatically toasty and charred on the nose, this offers chocolate and hickory aromas. It feels smooth, plush, layered and not at all simple, with baked black-fruit flavors that are draped over savory barbecue and spice accents. The toast is present but not overpowering on the finish."
White Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine Cauhapé,16.0,91.0,"A blend of Gros Manseng and Camarelet, this fruity effort is packed with flavors of apricot and peach, plus a rich, exotic mango twist. Delicious to drink now."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Spindrift Cellars,16.0,91.0,"Creamy and leesy, with a complex mix of mineral, fresh herb, citrus rind and pungent botanicals, this is an interesting and refreshing style of Pinot Gris. Give it a good chill and watch it open as it warms."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Ollivier Frères,16.0,91.0,"This is a yellow fruit and spice flavored wine. It is rich, just cut with acidity and with rounded fruit flavors and a generous texture. It is an impressive development from a young, crisp Muscadet and shows how well some wines from the region can age. Drink now."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,16.0,91.0,"Lifted pear-drop aromas are accompanied by the peppery green of watercress and arugula. The concentrated palate is grounded by earthy, savory yeast notes and framed by fresh lime peel. There is a dollop of riper pear fruit at the core, shining and shimmering with added charm."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,16.0,91.0,"This wine's restrained nose just hints at blueberry and cinnamon. The palate comes in with freshness, verve and balance. Crunchy red cherry fruit is at the core, balanced by freshness and a taut structure. An elegant, ripe, medium-bodied red."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Strehn,16.0,91.0,"A touch of smoke is all that appears on the nose of this tight and taut wine. Acidity and slight tannic grip provide a structure and frame its lovely, tart but dark fruit that recalls fresh blueberries tinged with peppery spice. Crunchy, classy and moreish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beira Interior,Companhia das Quintas,16.0,91.0,"As with other wines from Quinta do Cardo, this is packed with minerals and a dark, stony texture. It is concentrated, full of intense acidity and powerful tannins. Rich, it conveys a genuine sense of aging potential. Don't drink before 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Vicente Faria Vinhos,16.0,91.0,"Vicente Faria delivers a densely ripe wine made from selected vineyards. Wood aged, with rich black, tarry fruit and dark chocolate aromas, it's an impressive blend that will need to age. Drink from 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Slow Press,16.0,91.0,"Generous and flavorful, this is one of the best California AVA wines available. It's concentrated and tannic, with medium-full body, a hint of sweetness and layers of dark cherry and plum fruit. Baking spice nuances linger on the finish. Best after 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Sagrado,16.0,91.0,"Rich while also structured, this big, ripe wine comes from an estate owned by the Càlem family since the 1820s. It has concentration both from the tannins and from the black-plum fruits, and offers good potential. Drink from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Manzwine,16.0,91.0,"Dominated by Syrah, this wine is dark and dense. It is perfumed with solid tannins and the potential of juicy red fruits. Grown in the Pamela area of the Setúbal peninsula, south of Lisbon, the wine is both warm and densely concentrated. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Brandborg,16.0,91.0,"This wine is labeled medium dry, a fair description. Aromatic with waxy, mixed citrus components, it's refreshingly tart, with suggestions of lemon peel throughout. The finish brings in notes of orange-pekoe tea, with good concentration and length."
Syrah,US,California,Morse,16.0,91.0,"This big mouthful of wine offers great value. Smelling like licorice and chocolate and tasting like superripe berries and black figs, this brute has full body, great concentration and richness of flavor, a thick but soothing texture, and a long, lingering finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,16.0,91.0,"It is always intriguing when a very light-bodied wine has lots of depth and flavor. There is an abundance of citrus peel freshness, especially grapefruit, with more subtle, almost salty notes of spice that make you want to keep sipping. This offers wonderful verve and refreshment."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Muruve,16.0,91.0,"This firm but approachable Toro opens with rich, raisiny aromas that include integrated oak and cassis. There's some scratch and tannic bite to the palate, but not enough to make this too harsh. Flavors of loamy, rooty black fruits, chocolate and coffee finish long. Drink through 2017."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Sélection Laurence Féraud,16.0,91.0,"This super bargain reflects the charm of the 2011 vintage in its supple tannins and forward fruit. It's lush and creamy textured, with expressive notes of kirsch, spice and cocoa. Drink now–2017."
Red Blend,US,Oregon,Sineann,16.0,91.0,"This superb value mixes barrels from all the red wines in Sineann's portfolio. Predominantly Pinot Noir, Merlot and Zinfandel, there are small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot as well. It's dark and spicy, the flavors well integrated. It adds up to a potent and powerful all-purpose barbeque red, loaded with black fruits and finished with a kiss of caramel."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Fabre Montmayou,16.0,91.0,"Black cherry, blackberry and marzipan aromas are full, lusty and inviting. This has a chewy, full-bodied and layered mouthfeel to go with the dark-fruit flavors that are aided by spice notes. A peppery chocolaty finish is solid, ripe and friendly. Drink through 2020."
Zinfandel,US,California,Bonterra,16.0,91.0,"This wine is big and bold, but its opulent, generous fruit flavors perfectly fill out its frame, giving it the balance it needs for enjoyment. Ripe blackberry and black cherry notes mark the palate, unfettered by oak-inflected flavor. The texture is firm with lots of fine-grained tannins, while the fruit lingers nicely on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,New York,Red Tail Ridge,16.0,91.0,"Delicate layers of smoke, vanilla and spice lavish this textured Chardonnay that's remarkably light on its feet. Fermentation in a variety of oak barrels lends nuance to bright apple, pear and honeysuckle notes on the palate and mouthfeel that's rich, creamy and round. Brisk acidity cuts through the finish."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,St Hallett,16.0,91.0,"This is appropriately austere for a young Eden Valley Riesling, offering crisp green apple and lime sensations backed by subtle grace notes of wet stone. The finish is long, mouthwatering and almost painfully tart, suggesting it will fare well in the cellar for up to 10 years."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,16.0,91.0,"A perfumed wine, it has a rich, rounded character packed with yellow fruit. Layers of wood add complexity and density. The wine is named for the white owl found in the nature reserve close to the vineyards."
Moschofilero,Greece,Mantinia,Nasiakos,16.0,91.0,"Opulent aromas of honey, flowers and peach lead this distinctive white. Full-bodied and full of exotic citrus, spice and tropical fruit flavor, it's classic but will appeal to myriad palates. A balancing acidity gives it focus."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Gerhard Pittnauer,16.0,91.0,"A touch of plum plays among the ripe, red-cherry notes of the nose. The palate presents a darker, more brooding aspect of blueberry and forest fruit, with a superfine haze of crunchy tannins. Although the body is slender, crunchy and fresh, it packs an appetizing punch. The finish is refreshing and lip-smacking."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Southard,16.0,91.0,"A blend of Viognier and Roussanne, this humbly-labeled white is a revelation. On the palate, it has the style and sleekness of fine Burgundy, with flavors running through a spectrum of herb, citrus and tree fruits. This is polished and seductive."
Riesling,US,Washington,Alexandria Nicole,16.0,91.0,"Though the term late harvest would suggest a sweet, dessert wine, this is more on the off-dry side of Riesling, with juicy acids that cut the impression of sugar. Fragrant with scents and flavors of apricots, apple pie, honey and biscuit, it is expressive, nicely balanced and loaded with flavor."
Red Blend,US,California,Michael David,16.0,91.0,"Powerful oaky elements meet very ripe and concentrated fruit flavors in this deeply colored, bold and full-bodied wine. Charcoal, wood smoke and clove aromas are followed by blackberry jam and black-cherry flavors, while light, smoky and peppery nuances weave through them. While the first whiff is oaky, everything comes together well on the palate and finish."
Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Marc Kreydenweiss,16.0,91.0,"This wine develops slowly in the mouth, providing a finely structured, rich and elegant character. There's a round white-fruit flavor that's shot through with taut acidity. With its tight finish, it could age a few more months."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Dão Sul,16.0,91.0,"This wine is lean and still young, with concentrated tannins, firm acidity and smoky fruits that will take some time to develop. The palate suggests it will always be a mineral, tight and firm wine, even as the tannins soften. The finish is pure, juicy black currants. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Bonterra,16.0,91.0,"Substantive flavors and a rich, tannic texture form a serious profile for this deeply colored, dry and full-bodied wine. It smells like raspberries, tastes deep and concentrated, and has a very firm and nicely astringent mouthfeel. Pour it with a big steak, chop or roast."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quanta Terra,16.0,91.0,"After 14 months in large wood barrels, this wine is full of spicy flavors that go with the rich yellow fruits, generous apricots and peaches, and delicious acidity. This ripe wine is ready to drink."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,André Brunel,16.0,91.0,"An excellent value, this comes from vines that average 40 years of age. It's unusually complex for the price, offering hints of cracked pepper, clove, leather, plum and mint, all delivered with ample weight and a rich, supple texture. Drink now–2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Irony,16.0,91.0,"Full-bodied and firm yet rounded in mouthfeel and generous in fruit flavors, this wine strikes a harmonious balance that makes it irresistible. It boasts blueberry, black cherry, dark chocolate and cinnamon flavors, its plush texture carrying them long into the finish."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Spindrift Cellars,16.0,91.0,"Spindrift is the little winery that could, and makes excellent wines at consumer-friendly prices, from a variety of grapes that showcase all the strengths of Oregon. This lovely bottle is spicy and tart, yet full-flavored with a mix of lime, lemon, pineapple, pear and rind that gracefully runs into a midpalate that is full and spicy. The sharp acids keep it lively and refreshing, and the finish is nothing short of remarkable in a wine at this price."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Gifford Hirlinger,16.0,91.0,"Gifford Hirlinger's Stateline Red is perhaps the least-known best-value wine in the Walla Walla AVA. The blend changes radically from year to year—this is 83% Cabernet with splashes of Malbec, Tinta Cão, Tempranillo and Petit Verdot. Focused and concentrated, it has a streak of orange and cherry liqueur, and yummy highlights of coffee cake."
Syrah,US,California,Michael David,16.0,91.0,"Richness (of both flavor and texture) marks this deeply colored, full-bodied Syrah. Aromas of ripe blackberry and licorice coupled with flavors of clove and blackberry jam make it luscious yet not overly big. It has the firm tannins and good balance for aging through 2019."
White Blend,US,California,Vina Robles,16.0,91.0,"Fresh-squeezed apple juice, grapefruit spritzer and nearly sweet cherry aromas sit atop minerality on the nose of this blend of 46% Viognier, 19% Verdelho, 19% Vermentino and 16% Sauvignon Blanc. There's a lot of tart acidity, with a lingering apple flavor."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Clos Henri,16.0,91.0,"A French-owned outpost in the South Pacific, Clos Henri seems to be finally coming of age. This entry-level offering delivers a hint of smoky, fumé character, but also plenty of ripe fruit, ranging from fig, melon and stone fruit to zestier notes of passion fruit. It's reasonably full-bodied, with an attractive, silky mouthfeel and a touch of gingery spice on the finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Iris Vineyards,16.0,91.0,"Sourced from the Chalice (estate) vineyard, this aromatic and seductive wine presents a compelling mix of tree fruits, racy acidity, and a rich, textural, open mouthfeel. The flavors of pears, orange peel and snappy spices linger deliciously through a long finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine D'en Ségur,16.0,91.0,"Hugely tannic at this stage, this dense and complex wine has great structure partnered with dark black fruit and licorice. There is forward bitterness, suggesting this wine needs aging. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bonterra,16.0,91.0,"Well made, complex and complete, this offers a tantalizing whiff of lightly toasted oak that mingles with cinnamon and berry aromas, all carrying through to the palate. It's nicely balanced between assertive flavors, fresh acidity and full body. Nuances of rosemary, plum and cherry linger on the finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Pinto,16.0,91.0,"This is a creamy ripe wine, spicy and toasty in character with rich Chardonnay and local grapes to give a balanced texture. Acidity is there along with pineapple and white peach flavors. The rich rounded texture is generous and opulent. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Riesling,US,New York,Heron Hill,16.0,91.0,"While tight and mineral focused, this dry, featherweight Riesling seems to accumulate depth and body with each sip. It's brisk and spry, but a delicious streak of lanolin lends a waxy sheen that amplifies delicate notes of apple, pear and blossom. A strike of zesty lime acidity enlivens the finish. Drink now–2019."
Merlot,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,16.0,91.0,"Tart and bright, with an almost-jammy mix of raspberry and strawberry preserves, this concentrated, fruit-powered Merlot overdelivers for the price. Along with the luscious fruit are darker streaks of iron, coffee grounds and char, all in a classy, well-designed, four-vineyard blend."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Mommessin,16.0,91.0,"Griottes are a type of bitter cherry used in cooking, and this wine shares some of that character. It is firmly structured with acidity and an edge of attractive lightness. Age for 2–3 years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beira Interior,Companhia das Quintas,16.0,91.0,"This is an austere wine that blossoms slowly. Using grapes sourced from a vineyard at an elevation of 2,000 feet, this has a wild herb character along with dark black fruits and tannins that need several years to age. Give this very ageworthy effort at least four years."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Navarro,16.0,91.0,"Both elegant and refreshing, this citrus and floral-infused wine follows the Navarro house style for whites, which includes great balance, rounded mouthfeel and honey and floral accents. It's medium bodied, vibrant with acidity and wonderfully complex."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Unger,16.0,91.0,"Softly scented notes of ripe, yellow pears play on the nose. On the palate they become lusciously mouth-filling with their unobtrusive, friendly softness. There is a backbone of freshness and wonderful depth of lemon, with pear-scented concentration."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Companhia das Quintas,16.0,91.0,"This is both fruity and mineral driven, a combination that gives intense structure surrounded by ripe black fruit. Chocolate and spice notes come from the wood aging. All of the elements come together in a powerful, full-bodied effort that should age for three years."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Gladstone,Urlar,16.0,91.0,"Fig, nectarine and grapefruit notes mark this as a ripe style, without much of the herbal pungency found in Sauvignon Blancs from Marlborough. It's medium bodied, with a silky mouthfeel and a long, harmonious finish. Drink now."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,MontGras,16.0,91.0,"In every vintage this blend of Cabernet, Malbec, Merlot and Carmenère gets a little better, and the 2005 is the best yet. It's a ripe one for sure, with licorice, kirsch and earthy warmth on the nose. The body is big and the wine tastes of berry jam, licorice and chocolate. Balanced and long, with bitter espresso on the finish. Drink now through 2010."
White Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,16.0,91.0,"Soft ctirus notes appear first. The palate follows with gentle but focused mandarin peel and a bright, luminous core of citrus freshness and weightlessness. Nonetheless, this wine offers a depth of citrus fruit with clear focus and precision. This is lovely, pure and lasting."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Poggio Argentiera,16.0,91.0,"Blue flower, red berries and Mediterranean herbs take center stage in this delicious blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Ciliegiolo. The bright, lively palate offers a solid core of black cherry and raspberry layered with black pepper and thyme. It's extremely inviting and approachable now, so enjoy soon. Vos Selections, Tosco Wine."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Les Vignerons de Tavel,16.0,91.0,"The cave cooperative in Tavel is the largest producer in the appellation, so it's reassuring that so many of its cuvées scored highly in this year's tastings. Cinnamon and clove notes accent vibrant red berries and citrus in this medium- to full-bodied wine that's long, intense and crisp on the finish."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,16.0,91.0,"It takes a little time, but if you pay attention to the purity of fruit, this Zweigelt will have you hooked. It's that combination of pure blueberry fruit freshness and gentle but distinct tannic grip that will grab you almost unaware (likely somewhere midpalate) and you will want more. If you like it full-bodied but fresh, this is your wine."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,St Hallett,16.0,91.0,"A terrific example of drink-now pleasure from the Barossa, this Shiraz deftly combines cedar and vanilla notes with dark fruit flavors. It's richly textured, with velvety tannins and crisp acids that frame the long finish. Drink now–2020."
Zinfandel,US,California,Seven Deadly Zins,16.0,91.0,"This has an unusually dark color. Aromas of blackberry jam and maple syrup are followed by equally rich, deep and expressive flavors. The remarkable concentration of ripe berry flavors layered densely with fine tannins is at least partly due to blending in Petite Sirah. It adds up to a full bodied and delicious wine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beira Interior,Rui Roboredo Madeira,16.0,91.0,"This rich blend of Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional comes from high-altitude vineyards in Portugal's eastern mountains. With its structure and solid texture, it has both power and a sense of style and balance. It is drinkable although its fruit is young and will repay aging. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Airlie,16.0,91.0,"Produced entirely from vines planted in 1978, this drinks drier than its 13 g/L of residual sugar would indicate. It's juicy and loaded with apple, pear and tangerine fruit. A tangy taste of orange baby aspirin lingers on the finish."
Rosé,US,New York,Keuka Spring,16.0,91.0,"Luscious red cherries and raspberries abound from nose to finish in this buoyantly fruity yet dry, elegantly structured rosé. Made from Cabernet Franc and Lemberger, it's nuanced by faint whiffs of blossom and bramble. Revitalizing acidity makes it temptingly quaffable."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Aigner,16.0,91.0,"An aromatic nose combines jasmine and white blossom with creamy tangerine and citrus notes. The palate still has a touch of yeastiness, a lovely textural element and a dry, brisk freshness. It provides a charming combination of whistle-clean citrus notes on a very slender body."
Zinfandel,US,California,Bonterra,16.0,91.0,Beautiful black-cherry aromas and flavors make this wine direct and focused. A slightly gripping texture of fine-grained tannins and good acidity keeps the mouthfeel lively. It has a wonderful sense of purity and focus.
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Carl Ehrhard,16.0,91.0,"While soft spoken on the nose, the palate of this effusively fresh, fruity Kabinett bursts with ripe, peach and apricot flavors. It's irresistibly juicy and delicately sweet, balanced by a shower of tart tangerine acidity that extends the finish."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Southard,16.0,91.0,"Scott Southard has flipped the percentages from the 2010 vintage, placing Roussanne in the driver's seat, and Viognier holding up one third of the blend. Bright, tropical fruits are set in a frame of lusciously toasty oak, with highlights of roasted almonds and a bit of butter. Firm and substantial, with excellent depth."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Dão Sul,16.0,91.0,"This complex, mature wine has plenty of red fruit flavors, but its main character displays concentrated, tannin and spice. Hints of leather and rich acidity add their notes to this dense, dusty wine. It is ready to drink although it will still mature until 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Franc Cardinal,16.0,91.0,"A ripe and spicy wine from owner Sophie Holzberg that has tannins as well as rich black fruits. It has a concentrated backdrop that is dry and firm. Full, perfumed and generous, it will age well. Drink from 2019."
Moscato,US,California,Uvaggio,16.0,91.0,"This fascinating, sweet but light wine wraps lemongrass and thyme flavors around lemon and peach for interesting layers of complexity. The sweetness helps to round the texture and carries everything into a long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Claude Lafond,16.0,91.0,"The late Claude Lafond was the driving force behind the renaissance of Reuilly. His wines, such as this with its balance between crisp herbal flavors and ripe, almost tropical fruit, bring out the richness of the appellation. This wine, with its final minerality, is ready to drink."
Riesling,Germany,Germany,Loosen Bros.,16.0,91.0,"Exuberant green floral perfume, melon and peach abound on this profoundly aromatic sparkler. It's delicate in mousse with soft, persistent bubbles and deeply penetrating flavors of stone fruit and tangerine. Vibrant and spine-tingling, it's a remarkably elegant sekt with a gentle price tag."
Red Blend,US,California,Naggiar,16.0,91.0,"A very dark color, tons of ripe fruit aromas and abundant black-fruit flavors give a lot of wallop to this full-bodied but not overly sweet or fat Rhône-style blend. Ripe blackberry, stewed plum and a touch of smoke hang on a big structure of firm tannins and good acidity. It will be best after 2019, but it's difficult not to drink up at this price."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Kingston Family,16.0,91.0,"This small-production Sauvignon Blanc (700 cases) overdelivers on its price by a factor of two or three times. It gets going with crisp, crystalline aromas of passion fruit and briny grapefruit. A pure, juicy, ripped palate offers lime, grapefruit, tangerine and herb flavors, while the finish is minerally and clean."
Chardonnay,US,California,Zaca Mesa,16.0,91.0,"Tart aromas of sour cream, yogurt, candied lime and pressed quince show on the nose of this stylishly structured Chardonnay. The palate carries the theme forward, with pithy pink grapefruit notes, lime ade and brie rinds, showing firm tension on the tongue and bound-up energy that will keep this bottle alive for years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Sogrape,16.0,91.0,"One of a series of wines named after the ancient Roman city of Callabriga, this is solid, structured and wood-aged. Big black fruits stride across the palate giving both richness and a dense texture. It's a wine to age until mid-2015, although it is delicious enough to drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Clairac,16.0,91.0,"This is fruity and juicy with good acidity and fresh berry fruits. The 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon blend has the right amount of tannic character, showing structure that brings out ripe red fruits and indicates good potential. Drink from 2017."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Roquefort,16.0,91.0,"Both smooth and beautifully fruity, this is a balanced, delicious wine. It is full of wild strawberry flavors, the freshest acidity and a crisp finish with great acidity. It's a good choice with food and as an apéritif."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Vignerons de Tavel,16.0,91.0,"The Tavel cave cooperative also bottles wine from neighboring Lirac. This is an attractive, creamy-textured, supple wine that's ready to drink. Black cherries, dark chocolate and spice box notes finish soft and plush. Drink now–2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Companhia das Quintas,16.0,91.0,"With plenty of weight, but weight that is concentrated around a tight, firm tannic core. The wine has great ripe plum and black cherry fruits, brimming from the glass. The acidity is a strong presence, and with the tannin promises several years' aging."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Global Wines,16.0,91.0,"Dark black fruits and a dense, almost black color are signs of the concentration of this concentrated wine. Nine months in wood have added to the richness of the wine while preserving the blackberry and black-plum flavors. It is just ready to drink, although it will be much better from 2017."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Cantina Terlano,16.0,91.0,"Imagine aromas of the ripest pink grapefruit combined with beautiful floral notes. Then tropical fruit flavors chime in on the palate, which is satisfyingly full, yet not heavy. This is an intense and individualistic wine possibly best served as an apéritif. Editors' Choice."
Riesling,US,Washington,Zero One Vintners,16.0,91.0,"This is generous and juicy, with lush and very ripe flavors of apples and stone fruits, really loaded with fruit flavors and plenty of tangy acid. The midpalate hangs sensuously, loaded with sweet orange and Meyer lemon; this is the sort of rich, ripe, fruit-powered yet still racy Riesling that Washington makes better than anywhere in the world."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,16.0,91.0,"One of several properties owned by the Laplace family, this estate has produced a ripe, juicy and generously tannic wine. It has luscious acidity as well as bold black-currant fruit. With some dark tannins and a firm structure, it can age. Drink starting from 2018."
Fernão Pires,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Branco,15.0,91.0,"The fresh acidity typical of Fernão Pires is broadened by wood aging to yield a wine that has peach, apricot and green-fruit flavors, enhanced by floral aromas. There is a final, mineral texture."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de la Petite Cassagne,15.0,91.0,"This wine offers a complex, intoxicating bouquet: espresso, charred meat and black olive notes meld seamlessly together, adding notes of blueberries and pastry crust on the palate. It's not overly weighty, remaining fresh through the long, silky finish."
Chenin Blanc,US,Washington,Kiona,15.0,91.0,"It's listed on the back label as off dry, and in fact has 11 g/L of residual sugar, but it boasts a certain roundness and fruit persistence. Though labeled Columbia Valley, in fact it's 100% estate (Red Mountain) fruit, and old vine—30+ years—to boot. It's well-crafted, with a mix of citrus—flesh and rind—plenty of backing acidity and a thoroughly refreshing finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Joanin Bécot,15.0,91.0,"The wine has serious tannins and firm fruit that give an austere character at this stage. But it will develop and round out into a rich wine with ripe black fruits, always with a solid tannic structure. Owner Juliette Bécot manages the technical side here with consultant Jean-Philippe Fort from the Michel Rolland lab, and manages marketing at classed-growth Château Beauséjour-Bécot in nearby Saint-Émilion."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade dos Machados,15.0,91.0,"A bold, powerful wine, showing smooth, mature black-fruit flavors and rich tannins. It is soft, solid and powerfully built. Wood aging has given extra roundness and a touch of spice to the palate. Drink this wine now and until 2018."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade de São Miguel,15.0,91.0,"One of the star grapes of the Alentejo, this is a ripe, full-bodied and deliciously juicy wine. Almost black in color, it is packed with tannins, spice, intense acidity and a fine structure. It could do with some aging, so drink from 2016."
Grenache-Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Château Saint Esteve d'Uchaux,15.0,91.0,"From a leading small domaine, this blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah is sure to make virtually any lover of Rhône wines smile. Crushed thyme accents ripe cherry fruit in this full-bodied, moderately rich wine that ends with a dusting of velvety tannins. Drink now–2018."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,SoDo,15.0,91.0,"This wine is mostly Grenache (70%) along with Mourvèdre and Syrah. The aromas of raspberry and peppery spices are light and pure. The red-fruit and plum flavors are elegant yet sumptuous in feel, with the oak pulled back. It's unabashedly appealing and a great value to boot."
Glera,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Mongarda,15.0,91.0,"Citrus, Alpine herb and green-apple aromas carry through to the vibrant linear palate along with lemon zest, Anjou pear and a yeasty hint of bread crust. It's extremely refreshing, with crisp acidity a dry finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Berryhill,15.0,91.0,"This is an unusually complex and intricate wine that has more than simple crispness. It starts with grapefruit and bitter apple aromas and builds toward vibrant but rich grapefruit, mineral and savory consommé flavors. The texture is broad and mouthfilling but well supported and balanced by acidity. A great debut for Berryhill."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Cône-Taillasson Sabourin,15.0,91.0,"This ripe, juicy wine is already attractive and perfumed. Its tannins and wood-aging flavors give weight to its fruit. Spicy and full of black cherry and berry flavors, it's bold and will be ready to drink from 2019."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Domaine Capmartin,15.0,91.0,Organic Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat give this wine both its great fruit and its structure. It is a densely tannic wine with a solid core that then bursts out with black-currant and black-plum fruits. Intense acidity partners the concentrated fruit. Drink from 2020.
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Santos & Seixo,15.0,91.0,"This 100% Alvarinho comes from the grape's heartland in the north of the Vinho Verde region. It is crisp while also having concentrated green and citrus fruits, a rich mineral texture and layers of beautifully refreshing acidity. Drink this wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Drylands,15.0,91.0,"Agressively pungent and herbal without being over the top, this is Sauvignon Blanc that screams of its origins. Grapefruit and passion fruit flavors wash easily across the palate, leaving plenty of grassy herbaceousness in their wake, and a crisp, lingering finish. Drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Perescuma,15.0,91.0,"Almost black in color, this densely ripe wine is powered by wood aging and dark tannins. The blend of Syrah, Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez and Cabernet Sauvignon is tough, firm and tannic while also having big, bold juicy black plum flavors. Drink from 2017."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Bonnet-Huteau,15.0,91.0,"From schist soil, this tight and mineral-driven wine has crisp acidity enmeshed in the taut texture. This complex, young-tasting wine, with its structure, needs to age. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Roth,15.0,91.0,"Refreshingly marked by a tangy acidity, this white is made to please, fermented entirely in stainless steel. It sings in zesty, medium-bodied layers of peach and lime that are fresh and juicy on the palate, yet it somehow maintains some unexpected complexity."
Syrah-Grenache,France,Rhône Valley,Chateau Les Amoureuses,15.0,91.0,"Syrah-based, this is the Amoureuses cuvée most likely to be found on store shelves. It's full bodied and supple, with ample black cherry fruit and a savory side of cola and coffee. Long and smoothly textured on the finish, it's ready to drink now–2023."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Rulo,15.0,91.0,"Spicy, minty and sharp, this has a Sancerre-like edge, but with an extra weight to the fruit that is more reminiscent of like a South African Sauvignon Blanc. It's packed with green pea, herb, lemon and lots of citrusy flavors, all set against very sharp, bright but delicious natural acids."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Lujon,15.0,91.0,"This fresh, enticing wine is crisp and well-structured, with lemon, grapefruit and tangerine rind and flesh. The expansive palate has resonant minerality and excellent length, with ripe apple and pear fruit, plus highlights of toasted cashews and butter brickle from limited exposure in wood and partial malolactic."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Jones of Washington,15.0,91.0,"Honeysuckle scents and ripe, fresh fruit flavors run from grapefruit on into tropical. This was fermented in Hungarian puncheons, picking up just a hint of toast along the way. Clean and quite delicious."
Riesling,US,Washington,Kiona,15.0,91.0,"This estate-grown Riesling is sourced from some of the oldest vines on Red Mountain—planted in 1975–1976. Lush and textural, it's both rich and elegant, with flavors of pink marshmallow, honeycomb, pear and meringue. It fills the mouth with pleasing confectionary flavors, fine layering and depth. Residual sugar is 13 g/L—still dry enough for most foods."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,15.0,91.0,"Minty and toasty upfront, this is layered with blackberry, licorice, leather and toast aromas. It feels raring and ready to go, courtesy of firm acidity and good overall framing. Flavors of wild berry are bright, with herb and oak accents. Long, toasty and solid on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,15.0,91.0,"Grassy green hints play with faint tropical notes of passion fruit. The palate is taut and fresh and provides that wonderfully phenolic backdrop that makes Grüner such a success at the table. There is concentration and ample stores of fruit underneath that cool exterior, waiting to be plunged into."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,ColleStefano,15.0,91.0,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this delicious white opens with aromas of citrus blossom and white stone fruit. The tangy, medium-bodied palate offers a lovely depth of flavors that include juicy tangerine, lime, white peach, bitter almond and mineral. Crisp acidity brightens the rich flavors and carries through to the clean finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,15.0,91.0,"A subtle nose of lemon leads to a chorus of zesty, citrusy freshness: rind of lemon, grapefruit and mandarin make for a streamlined, concentrated and incredibly refreshing palate with a tangy moreishness. The purity of this wine shines. This is lovely now but will develop through 2020."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Maison Bouey,15.0,91.0,"The name means cornerstone and that is what Maison Bouey delivers in this ripe, structured wine. It has good balance between the wood aging and the rich yellow fruits. A touch of toast gives concentration and density. This full-bodied wine will age. Drink from 2018."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Château de Nages,15.0,91.0,"Proprietor Michel Gassier is turning out excellent values at all levels. This supple red blends 72% Grenache with 24% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre. Raspberry and rhubarb notes on the nose give way to flavors of ripe cherries, baking spices and dried herbs. The finish is long and velvety. Drink now–2020."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Viña Bisquertt,15.0,91.0,"Earthy, gamy aromas are intense and suggest meaty berry fruits and animal hide. In the mouth, this mystery red blend feels jammy but soft at its core. Baked black-fruit and chocolate flavors finish with a chewy texture and notes of fudge and cassis. For the price, this is a generous wine that overdelivers; drink through 2019."
Riesling,US,New York,Dr. Konstantin Frank,15.0,91.0,"With a palate-drenching fountain of peach nectar, grapefruit and orange blossom notes, this Finger Lakes standard packs a surprising punch in the 2014 vintage. Dry, yet intensely ripe, it boasts long, lingering streaks of honey and fruit offset by zigzagging daggers of lime zest and lemon. It's penetrating and deliciously persistent."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,15.0,91.0,"Some reduction still swings on the nose in the form of flinty smokiness, once this wears off, pure, taut, zesty lemon comes to the fore and remains the central feature of this streamlined, slender wine. There is midpalate texture and whistle-clean length."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Tejo,Caves Velhas,15.0,91.0,"This is a dark-hued wine that brings out the structure and strong minerality of Touriga Nacional in its home region of Dão. It is a powerful and dense selection, still dominated by tannins but offers plenty of perfumed fruit to balance. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,David Hill,15.0,91.0,"Spicy and showing some sweetness around the edges, presumably from a bit of residual sugar. Lovely fruit is the highlight here, textural and luscious with flavors of pears and apricots. Vivid acidity cuts through the fleshy core."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Buchegger,15.0,91.0,"White currant, green pear and peppery arugula rule this crisp white. It bursts with very ripe sweet, juicy pears on the palate, making for  savory sipping with lots of resonance, with or without food. Drink now."
Riesling,US,Washington,The Jack,15.0,91.0,"Delightfully spicy and fresh, this bright and lively Riesling shows a hint of sweetness from residual sugar just a bit under 2%. But the juicy flavors of citrus and stone, flesh and rind, really carry the day."
Syrah,US,California,J. Lohr,15.0,91.0,"This bottling offers gingerbread cake, baked blueberry and smoked pork on the nose. It's soft on the palate, with finely polished tannins imparting a plush texture. Black plum, strawberry and a touch of mint mark the palate. The structure shows itself just enough on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Gabarre,15.0,91.0,"In 1999, Stéphane and Paola Gabard resurrected winemaking at an estate that has belonged to the family since the 18th century. Ripe, rich and still retaining its youthful structure, this concentrated wine will need time. With its dense texture and layers of black-currant fruit, it has a fine future. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Grand Enclos du Château de Cérons,15.0,91.0,"The walled vineyard of Château de Cérons is a local landmark on the edge of a village better known for its sweet wines. This wood-aged, creamy dry white is deliciously balanced, showing apricot and spicy pear flavors alongside a light touch of toast. Ready to drink now."
Riesling,US,Washington,Mercer,15.0,91.0,"It would be interesting to slip this marvelous Riesling into a blind tasting of Mosel wines. Superb balance and finesse underscore the delicately rendered flavors of peach, apricot and lemon tea. A scent of powdered sugar is the only suggestion of the 1% residual sugar."
Red Blend,Chile,Rapel Valley,Anakena,15.0,91.0,"Big and earthy, with char, savory spice and black fruit aromas. The palate is full and bold, with ripe tannins and delicious flavors of herbs, baked berries, integrated spice and leather. Smooth, long and muscular; made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Contour,15.0,91.0,"This affordable wine is a testament to skilled sourcing and blending, using choice grapes from up and down the coast. Spicy cherry, forest and black tea aromas provide plenty varietal character, while medium-bodied weight and juiciness are lifted by bright acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,15.0,91.0,"Reliant on perfumed Touriga Nacional, this single estate wine is generous, ripe and full of black fruits. Richly tannic and structured, it has a serious side, firm and with good potential. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Ant Moore,15.0,91.0,"This is a top value, offering unusually rich palate weight and texture in a wine this inexpensive. Ripe stone-fruit flavors finish long, picking up hints of fresh herbs and leesy richness. Drink through the end of 2017."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,San Felice,15.0,91.0,"Made with Sangiovese, Pugnitello and Colorino, this beautiful wine has an intensely floral fragrance of violet and iris, with undertones of dried tobacco and forest floor. The palate delivers vibrant wild cherry, white pepper and mint along with firm yet elegant tannins."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac,15.0,91.0,"A powerful wine that has integrated its dense tannins with its equally impressive fruit. Blackberry jelly and spice mingle around a firm, dry core mingle in this concentrated, ageworthy wine. Drink now or keep for 4–5 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Santa Carolina,15.0,91.0,"This Cabernet delivers a complete package at an incredibly attractive price. Aromas of mocha, graphite and vanilla play nicely with core berry scents. Baked berry, vanilla and pastry flavors settle softly, with mellow tannins. Drink through 2018."
Carmenère,Chile,Rapel Valley,Santa Carolina,15.0,91.0,"Santa Carolina's Reserva de Familia red wines from 2007 are vastly improved from what the winery has done for the past two decades. This wine—along with the RdF Cabernet Sauvignon—show immense color and fruit, but also balance, structure and a friendliness that can't be mass produced. This wine is loaded with cassis, cherry, cola, mint, toast and bacon. And for $15 you'd be hard-pressed to find a better, more complete red from anywhere in the world."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de la Gaverie,15.0,91.0,"Tight, young and tangy, this wine will be delicious when it all comes together. The elements are all there, with the quince and pear fruits, intense acidity and the crisp texture that is so refreshing. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2017."
Syrah,US,California,Sola,15.0,91.0,"A nice discovery at a great price. This is a spicy, bold and concentrated wine with exciting oak accents that are like earth, pepper and cardamom resting on a firm palate of rich berries, grilled meat and black pepper flavors. The fine-grained tannins add good grip to the mouthfeel."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Goose Ridge,15.0,91.0,"This wine brings aromas and flavors of cherry, coffee, herbs, medicine cabinet and oak spices. The style is reserved, with a seamless, focused feel to the tart cherry and plum flavors that keep the attention on each sip."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Perescuma,15.0,91.0,"New wood aging gives this fine wine its smooth, ripe texture. It is rich and full of spice and generous tannins. It is dense with plum skin and blackberry fruits. Drink the wine from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Adega Cooperativa de Borba,15.0,91.0,"It is the ripe dark Alicante Bouschet that dominates this firmly structured wine. It is packed with tannins along with a hugely dense texture and concentrated juicy berry flavors. It is very firm, still young. Wait until 2017."
Albana,Italy,Central Italy,Tre Monti,15.0,91.0,"Savory and intriguing, this opens with heady scents suggesting ripe apricot, honeydew melon and Spanish broom. The round enveloping palate doles out juicy peach, ripe pear, bitter almond and a hint of honey. Mouthwatering acidity and a blast of tangerine give it a mouthwatering close."
Riesling,US,Oregon,LaVelle,15.0,91.0,"Looking for a stylish, elegant, low-alcohol, off-dry Riesling? Here it is. Under 11% alcohol, this floral, almost delicate wine is a breath of sweet air. A perfect mix of honeydew, Asian pear and ripe apple, it holds down center court with a delicious liveliness. Flavors extend, lightly kissed with honey, into a lingering, clean and sweetly fresh finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Thorn Clarke,15.0,91.0,"A terrific value if you can find it (alas, only 150 cases were imported), this is full bodied and richly textured, marrying hints of peppery spice with grilled lavender and rosemary that perfectly season the beach cherry and mocha flavors. It's stout, tannic and mouth coating on the finish, ideal for matching with roasts or steaks. Drink 2018–2025."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Mas Carlot,15.0,91.0,"Produced from the estate's old-vine Grenache, this is a silky, medium-bodied rosé. It's pale in color, but bold in flavor, offering hints of strawberries, peaches and brine that finish long and mouthwatering."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Pizay,15.0,91.0,"Of all the Beaujolais crus, Morgon is the one for aging. This wine, with its powerful structure, exemplifies age-worthiness. It is weighty and dense, with a solid feel, plus juicy, opulent fruit that helps to balance the wine. Keep for 3–4 years."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château de la Ragotiere,15.0,91.0,"Schist soil is characteristic of the Muscadet Sèvre et Maine region. It gives texture to a wine such as this, with its tight, mineral character and great freshness. This complex, densely structured wine is packed with very crisp fruit and lively acidity. This is the perfect wine for Muscadet's natural partner, shellfish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,José Maria da Fonseca,15.0,91.0,"This is a tight and structured wine, showing a fine balance between tannin and acidity, with dark, brooding fruit that still need time to develop. Give this wine until 2018."
Sémillon,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,15.0,91.0,"Blended with 17% Sauvignon Blanc, this lovely Sémillon is exceptionally fragrant, satiny and rich, with fleshy, ripe fruits and just a hint of toast. A warm streak of caramel enlivens the finish, which lingers gracefully and fills the palate with delicious flavors of apples and spicy pears."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Dina,15.0,91.0,"This is a very complete wine, with all the fruit and tannin elements in place. There's a fine and rich character here as well as a more austere, mineral side. The combination results in supporting tannins, dark fruits and good aging potential."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Opawa,15.0,91.0,"Pungent, leafy and loaded with passion fruit on the nose, this is green, but in a good way, balancing those notes with just enough pineapple and citrus flavors. For a medium-bodied wine, it shows remarkable creaminess on the palate. A long, tomato-stalk-accented finish completes the picture. Drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Magnum Vinhos,15.0,91.0,"Full of black fruits, the wine is solid, still very dense and young. Dark chocolate and coffee flavors give a bitter edge to the dense tannins, which need to be allowed to soften. Its black fruits and acidity are exuberant, and the wine will mature well. Drink from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,15.0,91.0,"Using grapes sourced from old vines, this is dark and concentrated. It's dominated at the start by firm, dry tannins, with its power coming from its dark, brooding fruit and dense structure. Age for at least four years."
Provence red blend,France,Provence,Les Vignobles Gueissard,15.0,91.0,"This comes from vineyards close to the Bandol appellation, and therefore close to the sea. It is a rich, full wine that has a concentrated character and ripe tannins. Bold plum and blackberry flavors give the wine ripeness while keeping everything in structure. Drink from 2017."
Zinfandel,US,California,Manifesto!,15.0,91.0,"This delicious Zin has almost everything one could ask for. It offers aromas of spicy oak and enticing ripe fruit. Flavors of black cherry and blackberry layer over subtle baking spices and smoke, while a great texture combines fine-grained tannins and firm acidity. A velvety viscosity helps flavors linger on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Sogrape,15.0,91.0,"Very structured and firm, this has dense tannins overlaying the black currant fruit. Its dry, solid texture ­dominates, yielding an impressive wine that has fine juicy fruit now and will age well over four years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Messias,15.0,91.0,"A powerful, punchy wine that brings richness along with acidity to a blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Barocca and Tinta Roriz. The smoothness of the surface hides firm, dusty tannins, with wild fig and dark plum flavors."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Muruve,15.0,91.0,"These are the kinds of Best Buys we love. In the case of Muruve's '04 crianza, the wine overdelivers by a sum and a half. The nose brims with cola, tar, menthol and other dark aromas, while the big but balanced palate delivers a belt of blackberry and plum flavors along with chewy, ripe tannins. Good now with grilled meat, but will age for another five years should you want to invest in more than one bottle."
Glera,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Marchiori,15.0,91.0,"This traditionally crafted, unfiltered sparkler opens with heady aromas of white spring flowers, wisteria, hawthorn and white tree fruit. The bright palate offers green apple, pear and lemon-lime while a mineral note backs up the finish. Bracing acidity provides support while a refined mousse adds softness."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,15.0,91.0,"Eyrie is back in stride with this benchmark pinot gris after a sub-par '99 bottling. Fresh flavors of lemon zest and pear highlight a subtle wine whose subtle spice and zesty complexity promise a long,  pleasing life ahead."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,15.0,91.0,"Pinot gris as it should be — ripe and full-bodied, with expressive flavors of fresh pears, spiced with cinnamon. Rich and satisfying, yet tangy enough to accompany even delicate seafood. This is a home run, with just enough of a hint of barrel to give it a finishing kiss of butterscotch."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Barons V,15.0,91.0,"This is succulent yet delicate, with dried hay and sweet grass flavors. Textural, vivid and racy, it has a Loire-like mix of fruit, flower and herb, with the possibility of improving still further over the next 4–5 years."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine des Terrisses,15.0,91.0,"This intensely fresh red wine is a blend of Duras, Braucol and Syrah in a textured, stalky style that is tight and layered with tannins. It's certainly young, still bursting with fruit and needing to fill out as its tannins soften and its black currant fruit calms down. Then it will be a fascinating, complex wine, elegant and poised. Drink from 2018."
Syrah,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,15.0,91.0,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable wine, from the first whiff of cranberry and pine needle through the smooth finish that offers the faintest hint of butterscotch. A network of barely-there tannins supports agreeable flavors of cranberry, slightly tart cherry, butterscotch and sage."
Chardonnay,US,California,Castoro Cellars,15.0,91.0,"A solid wine for the price, this begins with honeydew and lime aromas. Flavors start with a spicy cinnamon apple before diving into buttered squash, melon and fresh lime, with a dash of salt."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,15.0,91.0,"A blend of 60% Syrah, 27% Merlot and a handful of other varieties added to the mix, this aromatically pops, with complex notes of plum, blueberry, smoke, chocolate and floral accents. It's silky smooth in feel, with abundant chocolaty flavors that help it go down far too easy."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Foris,15.0,91.0,"This outstanding wine should earn the somewhat difficult grape many new fans. It opens up beautifully with ample aeration and is true to variety without giving the impression of cheap perfume, emphasizing spice over powdery scents and showing plenty of ripe fruit, from Asian pear, to pineapple to jicama."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Setubal,José Maria da Fonseca,15.0,91.0,"Named after winemaker Domingos Soares Franco, this is a serious, intense, wood-aged wine. Along with the new wood flavors, it has rich blackberry fruit and dry tannins. With its firm concentrated structure, this is one age-worthy wine."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,15.0,91.0,"This wine is an exemplary expression of Touriga Nacional. It has structure, perfumes, rich black-fruit flavors and a serious tannic background. Concentrated and with fine intensity, it needs to age, so drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Les Combes,15.0,91.0,"Frédéric Borderie brings his winemaking experience from Australia and Napa Valley back to the family property and this crisp and perfumed wine. It has great spiciness balanced by crisp green and white stone fruits. The wine could do with a few more months, so drink from late 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,15.0,91.0,"This is a ripe and spicy wine that is full of dense black fruits. Tannins and spice from wood aging merge with the rich fruit, giving a dry core to the plump, generous wine. It can be drunk now, although the wine will be better from 2017."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Graziano,15.0,91.0,"Absolutely fresh and pleasantly floral in both aroma and flavor, this dry wine will be a treat to drink before the meal or with seafood as delicate as sauteed trout or rich as bouillabaise. Melon and apple-peel flavors and good, crisp acidity give it a surprisingly assertive texture for something so natural and fruity."
Riesling,US,Washington,Scarborough,15.0,91.0,"Travis Scarborough has produced an outstanding Riesling, with a light coating of honey over rich and tart lemon and pineapple fruit. The concentration and length are admirable; this wine is delicious now but could be cellared for a decade or longer."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,15.0,91.0,"Orange-marmalade aromas set the stage for a rather full-bodied, dry and flavorful wine. Floral and fruity elements are counter-balanced by a tangy texture and subtle mineral accents. A classic of the type, it has a lot of personality, a great presence on the palate and a lingering finish."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Petit Clocher,15.0,91.0,"This is a beautiful nut and orange-flavored white wine. It has a mineral texture that is developing well into rich pear flavors that are lightly touched by honey. The wine from this estate in the Layon Valley is likely to age well. It can be drunk now, but it will be better from 2018."
Rosé,US,California,Carol Shelton,15.0,91.0,"One of the deepest colored rosés around, this wine has fresh, exuberant red-fruit aromas, while flavors bring as much complexity and depth as many full-fledged reds. Made from Carignane grapes, it does not follow the current vogue of pale-pink wines and is worth seeking out for its concentration."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos la Coutale,15.0,91.0,"In style, Coutale doesn't make many concessions to Malbec tannins. What you get is an impressively structured, firmly tannic wine, packed also with black fruits. The solid structure and the weight of fruit demand aging for at least 5 years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Block Nine,15.0,91.0,"Classy and classic French oak and red cherry aromas combine with raspberry flavors, lively acidity and firm, textured tannins to make a complete, well-balanced wine. This is a bit more austere than many of its peers, but the taut balance and appetizing texture make it more compelling."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Perescuma,15.0,91.0,"Strongly tannic, this is a firmly structured, wood-aged wine. The wood shows as dark toast that dominates the rich fruit that still needs time to show strongly. It's a complex wine, full of spice, acidity, and with a dry, dense core. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,US,Washington,O•S Winery,15.0,91.0,"Winemaker Bill Owen consistently produces one of Washington's most stylish Rieslings. High in acid and low in alcohol, the sweet-tart balance of the wine is exciting and perfectly rendered. Despite a change in vineyard sources, this remains rich, round and juicy, with flavors of peach, apricot and a hint of fresh cream."
White Blend,US,America,Sokol Blosser,15.0,91.0,"A nonvintage blend, the Evolution is as clever as it gets. This 18th edition (the edition numbers serve a similar function to a vintage date) melds several different grapes into an aromatic, lushly detailed whole. Stone and tropical fruits abound, loading the palate with flavors of peaches, cream and lemon meringue. It's thoroughly delicious without a hint of wood."
Riesling,Austria,Carnuntum,Artner,15.0,91.0,"A lovely ripeness of juicy, yellow pears peeks through the lemony freshness on nose and palate. While this wine is streamlined and slender, it hints at muscle and richness. Touch-and-go vintages like 2014 can produce thrilling wines—this is one of them, pitching fine fruit against absolute freshness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Rousset-Caillau,15.0,91.0,"Firm and concentrated, this wine has ample weight and aging potential. Dry tannins are balanced by ripe berry fruit, juicy acidity and solid structure. Give this dense wine at least five years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stadt Krems,15.0,91.0,"A touch of yeast and sage emerges amidst lime peel scents on the nose of this wine. The palate reinforces those flavors, while white pepper and lime notes tingle around the edges. It's lean but concnetrated and finishes with such a clean and refreshing zip that you just want to sip more."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Tournon by Michel Chapoutier,15.0,91.0,"This is full and richly textured without being overdone. Crushed stone and cracked pepper aromatics give it a nose that resembles some Northern Rhône examples, while the fruit is earthier and tinged with blackberries, then finishes with dusty tannins. Drink now–2020."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Thorn Clarke,15.0,91.0,"A terrific value, the 2012 Mount Crawford offer sup a big hit of lime on the nose, but also intriguing brine and talc notes that add extra dimension and complexity. It's a medium-bodied wine with ample texture and a long, layered finish. It may not age as long as some other Eden Valley Rieslings, but it's delicious now, so why wait?"
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Gerhard Pittnauer,15.0,91.0,"Layers of Amarena and Bing cherry play hide and seek with hints of mulberry on the plump, velvety midpalate. There are suspicions of sweet vanilla and some anise. With such soft, mellow fruit and smooth, ripe tannins, this is incredibly seductive and approachable right now, although it also has the stuffing to age beautifully."
Merlot,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,15.0,91.0,"This is still a little hard and tight, but shows great ripe red berry fruit and well-balanced tannins. Another Arbor Crest wine with a fine, fragrant bouquet, clean and bursting with fresh fruit scents. It was barrel aged for 20 months in 40% new oak, adding some strength to the tannins and hints of toast to the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,15.0,91.0,"The earthy aromas of Castelão show strongly. Complex, rich and juicy, this wine's tannins and black fruits vie amicably for dominance, and they promise good aging. It has a spice note and a firm structure, with a fleshy character."
Sauvignon Blanc,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Borgo Conventi,15.0,91.0,"The top cuvée of Sauvignon Blanc from the Borgo Conventi estate, now owned by Ruffino but still run by the Vescovo family. This is a huge, rich, forward style of Sauvignon, very ripe and tropical. Yet it has a layer of crisp, grassy fruit that gives it balance and poise."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,15.0,91.0,"Aromas of black cherry, almond and espresso bean open on the palate to flavors of cassis, black cherry, strawberry, black pepper and custard. Smooth tannins linger on the palate accompanied by flavors of juicy fruit."
Cabernet Merlot,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,15.0,91.0,"Dark ruby to the eye, this wine offers a nose of raspberry, talc and violet. There is a nice mix of baking spice and fruit flavors, dominated by blackberry, black cherry, clove and anise with touches of black pepper. The finish is reminiscent of cherry pie, with mingling flavors of cherry, spice and vanilla."
Abouriou,France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,15.0,91.0,"Despite its proximity to Bordeaux, the Marmandais has managed to retain Abouriou as its own grape variety. As part of its conservatory of some of the more obscure grape varieties, this producer has made this fine and fruity wine. It is smoky with attractive tannins and swathes of juicy black fruits. It's a fine wine to drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo,14.5,91.0,"This big and bold wine exudes power and fruitiness. It has ripe fruits, sweet tannins and a great mix of spice, toasty wood and acidity. Both juicy and structured, it's likely to develop well. Drink from 2016. Firmly structured, this has both great tannins and equally big, rich berry and black currant fruits that bring the acidity right up front. It is still young, emphasizing the fruit and freshness. The tannins and wood aging flavors need their chance. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Carl Graff,14.0,91.0,"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Wildhurst,14.0,91.0,"With rich melon aromas, ripe apple flavors and a soothing, almost soft texture, this wants some rich, sophisticated cooking to go with it, like sautéed fish with a classic French sauce. Subtle acidity keeps the notes of almond and apple lingering on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Murphy-Goode,14.0,91.0,"Crisp citrus aromas and fresh lemon and grapefruit flavors define this medium-bodied, appetizing and unapologetic wine. With lots of personality, a tingly texture and tangy finish, it's just the thing for appetizers and first courses."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ravenswood,14.0,91.0,"This sophisticated, dry and affordable wine will shine at mealtime due to its balance between generous fruit flavors and an appetizing, moderately tannic texture. Aromas resemble raspberries and red cherries, while flavors are a bit riper than that. The acidity is lively and the finish lingers."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine des Terrisses,14.0,91.0,"This is a broad, rich blend of Duras and Braucol with a little Syrah thrown in. It is ripe, with black fruits and balanced tannins that give structure but do not dominate. A smoky character from wood aging rounds it out. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Les Grands Maréchaux,14.0,91.0,"Initially firmly tannic, this opens to reveal fine blackberry fruit and fresh acidity. It's a generous wine, the wood aging giving tannins and spice while the delicious fruit offers a rounder, smoother side. Drink from 2020."
Riesling,Austria,Kamptal,Nastl,14.0,91.0,"An aromatic hint of quince dances over the various zesty citrus flavors on this slender, crisp and light yet expressive Riesling. The palate is governed entirely by lemon zest freshness and lingers beautifully. There are illuminating flashes of quince again on the finish. Savor this so you can capture them."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Viento,14.0,91.0,"Still spritzy, very tart and tangy, with orange peel and lemon drop flavors. Perhaps showing just a bit more intensity than the 2006, this is a terrific follow-up with the same mix of delicacy and power that suggests that the Columbia Gorge AVA may well be the best site in the Pacific Northwest to grow Riesling."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Husch,14.0,91.0,"A fresh, invigorating citrus and pine flavor energizes this crisp and yet substantive wine in a way that will taste great with seafood and fresh cheeses. It shows nice concentration, fine balance and a lingering finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,14.0,91.0,"Firmly tannic, this is a solid, chunky wine. It's full of dark plum, black currant and cherry flavors that fill out the firm, dry structure. Concentrated while also fruity, it's worth aging for a year."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,US,Washington,Charles & Charles,14.0,91.0,"Cabernet makes up three-quarters of this blend. Appealing aromas of dried herbs, blue fruit, coffee and spice lead to sweet, full-feeling cherry and plum flavors backed by a light grip of tannins."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Vignelaure,14.0,91.0,"This 125-acre vineyard in the hills to the north of Aix-en-Provence has 24 acres dedicated solely to this rosé. It is delicious, fruity, and just right in its light tang of minerality that makes it both structured and refreshing, with a ripe yellow fruit aftertaste."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Nastl,14.0,91.0,"Zesty green citrus with lifted notes of Conference pear strike out for a fruity opening. The palate follows up with concentrated spiciness and even more grapefruit zest. This is lively, taut, slender, refreshing and full of tension, with an appetizing edge of pepper."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Chateau Haut Rian,14.0,91.0,"Complex and rich, this is an impressive, concentrated wine. It has great acidity that balances flavors of ripe white fruits and apple skins, and lends a tight, taut texture. The wine should be aged for at least six months before drinking."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Dão,Global Wines,14.0,91.0,"Winemaking at the aristocratic Santar estate is run by Global Wines. This rich wine, dominated by the high-quality Encruzado grape, is poised between crisp apple fruitiness and toast from wood aging. At two years old, the wine is just ready to drink although it will be better from 2018."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,14.0,91.0,"Putting two naturally tannic grapes together seems to soften them both. The blend gives this rich wine structure, as well as rich plum and damson, leather and smokiness. The wine finishes on a high note of acidity. Age and drink from 2016."
St. Laurent,Austria,Niederösterreich,The Dot,14.0,91.0,"Wonderfully tart, fresh red cherry fruit expands on this wine's nose and palate. It's wonderfully poised and pitched just right between generosity and restraint. Its crunchy cherry fruit feels honest and elegant. The finish is lip-smackingly fresh."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta da Rede,14.0,91.0,"This has great fruits and plenty of structure to go with it. Juicy plum flavors complement the dense tannins, mineral structure and concentrated texture. It's a stylish wine that will develop some more. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Chantemerle,14.0,91.0,"Densely tannic while also fruity, this is a product of ripe fruits that give a black currant flavor as well as a solid structure. The acidity gives great lift to the end of this finely made wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Wondrous,14.0,91.0,"This Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot dominant blend comes from some top quality vineyards that are seldom seen in a wine at this price, including Seven Hills, Canoe Ridge, Wallula, Tapteil and Champoux. Aromas of herb, berry, cherry and toasty spices give way to clearly high-quality fruit that has seen a lot of love and care. It's a big time winner at this price."
White Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,14.0,91.0,"A gently floral nose gives rise to a charming and soft palate. Fresh pear buried in mounds of white petals on the nose leads to a distinct, ultraclean and dry palate. Despite its alluring, aromatic softness it has complete focus. The finish offers pure lemon."
Red Blend,Morocco,Zenata,Ouled Thaleb,14.0,91.0,"A black cherry hue in the glass, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Grenache has a bouquet of ripe cherry, vanilla, toffee and chocolate. Smooth tannins are barely felt unless you linger a moment too long before the next sip. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry, toffee, eucalyptus and sage power through the lasting finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Oak Knoll,14.0,91.0,"Delicate, but nicely concentrated, with flower and fruit nicely integrated. Meyer lemon, tangerine, pear and even a hint of candied papaya mingle beautifully, set in a fine-tuned frame of acid and mineral."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Coste Peyrouse,14.0,91.0,"This is a balanced and stylish wine, with a solid base of solid tannins and a dry core that gives strength to the blackberry fruit and acidity. There is minerality as well as a firm, austere finish. Age for 4–5 years."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château de la Ragotiere,14.0,91.0,"Left for 30 months on its lees before bottling, this is serious Muscadet. It has weight and richness, round and smooth with a creamy texture brightened by flashes of citrus acidity. Impressively rich wine, now ready to drink."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Viento,14.0,91.0,"At 1,200 feet, the Underwood Mountain vineyard brings a certain illumination and transparency to the Riesling grape. It's a style both elegant and intense, and nowhere else in Washington state except the Columbia Gorge does Riesling achieve this sort of delicate power. Scents and flavors of blossom, citrus and stone fruits combine in a gorgeous display. It's bright, lip-smacking and beautifully balanced."
White Blend,US,California,Peirano,14.0,91.0,"Tempting vanilla and nutmeg aromas and ripe pear and pineapple flavors animate this full-bodied, smooth and delicious wine made with 75% Chardonnay plus Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier. The generous fruit and oak components are layered and creamy in texture."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château de Chambert,14.0,91.0,"This is a big, rich wine, with swathes of black currant fruit and ripe spice. The tannins are there too, a wall of solid texture and dark structure. With this weight and density, it's obvious that this wine needs some serious aging, so don't drink before 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Broken Clouds,14.0,91.0,"This wine drinks qualitatively above and behind its low price, delivering light, clear color and tangy wisps of cranberry and citrus-tinged minerality. With a depth of character that builds on the midpalate, it finishes lean and crisp, a wonderfully elegant expression of the variety."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Dina,14.0,91.0,"While this dense wine has plenty of firm tannins, it also has fine, ripe fruit. Rich blackberry flavors and smoky aromas dominate. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Sainte-Marie,14.0,91.0,"Warm and ripe, this is a delicious, structured wine from a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot from Stéphane Dupuch. It has fine tannins that give a spicy character aided by 14 months in French oak as well as bold black fruits that are developing well. The acidity at the end adds the freshness. Drink from 2019."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Vinum,14.0,91.0,"This exciting, refreshing, superbly balanced wine has crisp green apple aromas and lively, almost electric lemon, lime and cucumber flavors. It's a great choice for lunch or with an appetizer course, since it's sure to get the conversation—as well as the appetite—going."
Aragonês,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,14.0,91.0,"This is a rich, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink now. It still has a dry core of tannins, although they are overwhelmed by the rich, juicy black fruits and generous texture. It's a concentrated wine, high in alcohol, although that is really balanced by the fresh aftertaste."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Castello d'Alba,14.0,91.0,"This is a young, firm and seriously tannic wine that will need several years to age. It has structure, a sense of the tough terrain of the upper Douro. Concentrated and dense, it's a wine that will develop; best after 2017."
Syrah-Grenache,France,Rhône Valley,Mas des Bressades,14.0,91.0,"This wine is a perennial overachiever, but the 2015 is even more so than usual. The aromas are bold and ripe, offering notes of cherries, ample garrigue and hints of tar. The wine is rich and velvety on the palate, folding in notes of chocolate, baking spices, plum and dried herbs. Drink now–2025."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Bois Malot,13.0,91.0,"This Meynard family wine is ripe and soft with a smooth, creamy texture and a perfumed backdrop.

Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tiefenbrunner,13.0,91.0,"White spring blossom and citrus aromas waft out of the glass. On the palate, crisp acidity brightens creamy apple, pear and tangerine zest. It's quite simply crisp and delicious."
Shiraz,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,13.0,91.0,"Grand'Arte is the top range from DFJ Vinhos, highlighting wines that express the individual varieties. Labeled Shiraz rather than Syrah, this is a powerful, spicy, rich wine. Solid tannins and dark black fruits are layered with acidity and ripe plums. With its structure, it will age well for a value-priced wine; drink from 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Carnuntum,Markowitsch,13.0,91.0,"Green pear peel, some yeasty spice and a bit of lemon zest make for an invigorating nose. The palate comes with apt concentration and provides proper midpalate interest with zest and herbal notes. Lovely grippiness calls for food, but this slips down easily enough by itself."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Grand Champ,13.0,91.0,"This is a rich wine that's full of apricot, melon and pear flavors. It has weight, ripe fruit and a good touch of minerality, with a clean and crisp finish. Age this for a year or two."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Condado de Oriza,13.0,91.0,"Sensational for the price. This die-hard bargain is loaded with berry richness, sweet pulp, coconut and balance. It's a little creamy, but generous and integrated. Smells, tastes and finishes like something that costs three times more."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de la Gaverie,13.0,91.0,"This medium-dry Chenin is deliciously ripe while still light and very fruity. Currant flavors give a juicy character, accented by honey and crisp apples. Fruity now, the wine will become richer and bring out almonds and a more textured character. Drink from 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Burgenland,Von Donabaum,13.0,91.0,"This wine leads with lovely touch of flint, accentuating its green pear and lemon zest aromas. On the palate, it's light and dry, with a phenolic character that lends both texture and structure, adding complexity to all the freshness."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Acrobat,13.0,91.0,"Flat-out delicious, this brings compelling fruit flavors of melon, papaya and pineapple, coupled with juicy, mouth-cleansing acidity. The depth and complexity are phenomenal for an Oregon Pinot Gris produced in large quantities."
Shiraz,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,13.0,91.0,"This pure Shiraz gives a wonderfully perfumed wine that is both spicy and packed with dark, dense fruits. Blackberries are supported by soft tannins and a touch of caramel from wood aging. It's solid, firm while also fruity and should age. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Marisco Vineyards,13.0,91.0,"This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc is slightly leafy in style, but balances that with lush citrus fruit. The crushed tomato stalk and grapefruit come together in a dry, harmonious finish that's mainstream delicious. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Cap Saint-Martin,13.0,91.0,"This wine is rich, spicy and full of black fruit. With solid tannins alongside its juicy black currant flavors, it's firm and will age well. Its density and richness are developing and will be best from 2020."
Fernão Pires,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Branco,13.0,91.0,"An impressive wine that is packed with notes of rich fruit, toast and vanilla.

Red Blend,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,13.0,91.0,"A nose of cherry, violet and flint cedes to juicy flavors of pomegranate, cherry, salted popcorn, lavender and sage. Evenly weighted tannins and acidity make for good mouthfeel and a graceful finish."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Mercer Canyons,13.0,91.0,"Half barrel-fermented and half done in stainless steel, this classy effort seems to overdeliver. It starts with good fruit, but the feeling is that winemaker Jessica Munnell did everything right, and maxxed out the complexity. It's a sensuous mix of grape and barrel, steel and butterscotch, with a lively, lingering finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Esser,13.0,91.0,"This fresh-smelling wine blends aromas of caramel apple and light grapefruit juice. The palate is racy in acidity, like a glass of fresh orange juice splashed with squeezes of lemon and grapefruit, and a vanilla warmth toward the finish."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Pizzolato,13.0,91.0,"Made entirely with organic grapes, this delicately sparkling wine boasts enticing scents of white spring flower, beeswax and pear.

Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Alois Lageder,13.0,91.0,"Beautiful aromas of creamy apple, white flower and ripe pear carry over to the bright delicious palate along with a hint of lemon zest. Crisp acidity lifts the lingering finish."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,13.0,91.0,"There is a solid amount of wood here, but the fruit has weight enough for it. The tannins are dark, brooding in character, but they also support ripe and juicy fruits. With its dusty texture, this wine could certainly be aged for several years."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Anselmo Mendes,13.0,91.0,"Fruity and intense, this is a very fine Vinho Verde from the northern vineyards of the region. It is full, packed with pear, lemon meringue and grapefruit flavors, feeling rich as well as crisp. A wine like this can age, so drink until 2017."
Petite Sirah,US,California,HandCraft,13.0,91.0,"Lavish fruit and extravagant spicy oak flavors balance each other well in this big, showy, dark and tannic wine. The color is black almost to the rim, and it has plenty of body, thick tannins and concentrated boysenberry flavors. Best now through 2019."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,13.0,91.0,"Rarely used on its own, Alicante Bouschet from the cooler Lisboa region can obviously produce an impressively structured wine. Naturally juicy, the wine also has firmer tannins, damson fruit flavors and balancing acidity. Drink now, or keep until 2015."
Zweigelt,Austria,Niederösterreich,R&A; Pfaffl,13.0,91.0,"An inviting touch of cinnamon spices the red-cherry notes on the nose. Ripe red cherry and cinnamon also dominate the juicy palate that has a pleasant tannic grip. There is density on the palate and oodles of fruit, focused by freshness. This juicy, balanced red has a lip-smacking cherry finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta do Sobral,13.0,91.0,"This rich, spicy blend of Alfrocheiro, Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Jaen from winemaker Carlos Lucas offers rich black-plum fruits with layers of wood flavors. It is generous, juicy with some firm tannins and plenty of toasty wood flavors. Everything needs some time to soften, so wait to drink until 2019."
Zinfandel,US,California,Four Vines,13.0,91.0,"This beautiful wine has aromas as ripe as dried figs, flavors as deep as blackberries falling off the vine, and a welcoming, broad texture that begs for another sip. While full bodied, it's easy to relax into."
Syrah,US,California,Peirano,13.0,91.0,"Aromas and flavors range from charred wood to black cherry to white pepper to wild herbs. The complexity and diversity of tastes is fascinating, a reminder of how wild this grape variety can be. It's full bodied, smooth textured and firmly tannic."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Sénéjac,13.0,91.0,"This is a structured wine that has both firm tannins and ripe black plum fruits. It is concentrated and serious, the wood aging and the fruit tannins giving a lift and richness to the spicy fruit. The estate, dating to the 17th century, has 96 acres. Drink from 2021."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,13.0,91.0,"This is deeply colored and rich, showing both the juicy fruit character of Alicante Bouschet and a more serious, concentrated element. It's solid and densely tannic, with wood flavors layered on its black plum fruit. This is worth aging for another two years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Forstreiter,13.0,91.0,"Fragrant and delicately fruity, this is a lively, bright wine. It shows elegance, apple acidity and a stylish structure of zesty lemon and orange. It's delicious to drink now, but also keep a few bottles until 2019. Screwcap."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Beiras,Aveleda,13.0,91.0,"Quinta da Agueira was bought by the Guedes family of Aveleda in 1998. This pure Touriga Nacional is big, meaty and ripe, structured while also having firm, tarry tannins. The wine still has a way to go, with its black fruits and acidity still developing. Drink this powerful wine from 2017."
Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Portugal,Beiras,Aveleda,13.0,91.0,"From the aroma, this seems heavily wooded, but on the palate the wood spice is becoming well integrated with the dark berry fruits and mineral texture. It is certainly young. Already, though, the fruit is showing its potential richness. Give it 3–4 years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Türk,13.0,91.0,"Fern, jasmine, green pear and tart mandarin create an aromatic, inviting nose. The palate supports these aromatics with an intense, concentrated freshness of bright, pure lemon on the midpalate. This is streamlined and refreshing, with just the right amount of invigorating spritz."
Carmenère,Chile,Rapel Valley,Lapostolle,13.0,91.0,"One of the best value-priced, big and rich wines you're likely to find. The nose impresses with potent blackberry, cedar and marzipan aromas, and the palate bridges the gap between power and elegance. Tastes great, with herbal black cherry and cola leading the way. Very ripe but really well made."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Portal,12.0,91.0,"The Reserva version of Mural makes a powerful statement. Dark in color and packed with concentrated fruit, it is full of tannins as well as brooding black-plum flavors. Spice and juicy acidity complete the ensemble. It's a solid wine that needs to age to soften the tannic structure. Drink from 2017."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Noble Vines,12.0,91.0,"Another clean and tasty bottling from this label's numbered series, this shows light nectarine and lemon aromas on the nose.

Portuguese White,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,12.0,91.0,"Rich, smooth, with great wafts of creaminess to go with a judicious amount of toast. White plum and pear flavors precede a finish with impressive concentration and delicious acidity."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Pascual Toso,12.0,91.0,"A year or two ago when Paul Hobbs began consulting for Toso things changed for the better. This is the rare Best Buy that can swim with the big fish and give them a run for the money. Pop the cork and enjoy lusty dark aromas of Turkish tobacco and berry compote. In the mouth, there's a riot of fruit flavors to ponder followed by a smooth, lusty finish."
Assyrtiko,Greece,Atalanti Valley,Hatzimichalis,12.0,91.0,"This is a distinctive white with a combination of spice, tropical fruit and a chalky backbone. The wine is elegant and ageable and will appeal to fans of classic French whites like Chablis. Pair with grilled octopus or oysters for added appeal."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Gruber Röschitz,12.0,91.0,"Tart apples and green pears create a refreshing opening. The palate fizzes with uncannily truthful yellow grapefruit peel and white pepper. This is fresh but also holds generous, delicious fruit flavours at its concentrated core. An ultraclean finish makes you crave more."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Villa Wolf,12.0,91.0,"Lush mango and guava notes lend a sunny, tropical feel to this Riesling.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Cagnas,12.0,91.0,"This wine is closed at this stage, offering just hints to its potential. At the core, there are ripe stone fruits, dark plums as well as blackberries. Fine and stylish tannins add balance. This is a fine wine with a future. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Waterbrook,12.0,91.0,"A standout in this new vintage, Waterbrook's pure varietal bottling explodes into life with bright, spicy, pungent scents of recently mown lawn, herb, pine needle, citrus and melon. Fresh, clean, textural and persistent, it has a depth of flavor rarely found at this price."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Lacarelle,12.0,91.0,"The wine shows very ripe fruits that are now at their peak. It is rich, rounded with touches of spice, toast and mature berries. The acidity is now totally integrated into this full-bodied wine that is ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,US,Washington,Jones of Washington,12.0,91.0,"This is the best Pinot Gris yet from Jones; the grapes were sourced from the 2 Gun Vineyard in the upcoming Ancient Lakes region—a future American Viticultural Area. Leesy and creamy, it seduces with a layer of rich cream wrapped around bright orange and semitropical fruit flavors. It's full and fresh, and it lingers."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Tregole,12.0,91.0,"This earthy Chianti Classico offers bold aromas of truffle, underbrush, dried tobacco and ripe berry. The palate delivers succulent black-cherry balanced by white pepper, cinnamon and hints of carob. Drink now–2020."
Shiraz,India,Nashik,Sula,12.0,91.0,"Aromas of blackberry, cherry preserves, white chocolate and a hint of green pepper prepare the taste buds for flavors of forest-fruit, smoked pork, black pepper, violet and almond blossom. A trio of fruit, savory tones and spice travels across the palate on a layer of smooth tannins, leading to a smoky finish."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Mas des Bressades,12.0,91.0,"Flinty at first, then becoming more perfumed, with hints of herbs and berries. This lovely rosé is round and ample in the mouth, delivering a blend of fruit, herb and mineral flavors. Nicely balanced spice notes mark the finish. Drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Beiras,Aveleda,12.0,91.0,"Concentrated and powerful, this is a rich and intense black-fruited wine. Notes of spice, herb and dark chocolate mingle with the flavor of black plum juice and firm, dry tannins. The result is a wine that needs several more years to age."
Viognier,US,California,The White Knight,12.0,91.0,"Ripe flavors and a plush texture have not gone out of style in this opulent and tasty Viognier. Although not technically sweet, it has all these great dessert flavors: hazelnuts, toasted almonds and poached pears. The finish lasts 30 seconds or more."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Abiqua Wind,12.0,91.0,"This is a bright, spicy, crisply defined wine, and an overall supervalue. Clean and fresh flavors of apple and pear come lightly spiced, and are set against refreshing natural acidity. The fruit is sourced from a vineyard block planted in 1978."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Forstreiter,12.0,91.0,"Yeast still swings on the nose of this young, fresh Riesling. The palate, however, gives glimpses of what is yet to come: lovely notes of mandarin and plump citrus with lots of verve."
Syrah,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,12.0,91.0,"The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Tejo,Pinhal da Torre,12.0,91.0,"Now at peak maturity, this wine is generously rich as well as sophisticated and stylish. Firm tannins interweave with the juicy black fruit character. A dry background gives a leathery texture while still having room for fruit. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Castle Rock,12.0,91.0,"This smells and tastes like a pale Pinot Noir and has some of the body and smooth texture of a red wine, too. Tasty cinnamon, nutmeg and red-cherry flavors get plenty of uplift from zingy acidity, so the balance is great and the finish lingers."
Riesling,US,Washington,Charles Smith,12.0,91.0,"Kungfu Girl has become an iconic Riesling on the strength of its instantly recognizable label, and surpassing quality. At 11% alcohol and 18 g/L residual sugar, it rests comfortably on the fence between dry and off-dry, and is a bulls-eye rendition of Washington Riesling. A dense mix of citrus, apple and tree fruits, enhanced with skin textures and finishing with highlights of honey and tea, this is flat out delicious."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,20.0,90.5,"Loaded with power, this wine's nose is nutty and creamy, with caramel and popcorn aromas. This feels lively, but also rich and layered. Flavors of buttered toast, caramel, toffee and walnut lead into finishing accents of cocoa, caramel and salty buttered popcorn. Sweet smelling, but welcoming and true to the cream style. Feels creamy and soft by Sherry standards, with prune, raisin, caramel, toffee and chocolate flavors. Turns a touch bitter on the finish, with a final dose of raisin, honey and toffee."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Scharffenberger,20.0,90.5,"This lovely Mendocino sparkler, crafted from two-thirds Chardonnay and one-third Pinot Noir, has lilting apple and honey aromas buoyed by a thick head of mousse. There is a pleasing follow-through from aroma to flavor and a core of ripe apple. Dry, soft with a long finish, this is a hard-to-resist food-friendly wine ready to pair widely. A blend of two-thirds Chardonnay and one-third Pinot Noir, this emits an inviting whiff of caramel apple. On the palate, the frothy mousse is dry and balanced."
Muscat,Australia,Victoria,Campbells,19.0,90.5,"Dried figs, dates and maple syrup aromas are just what's expected from this deep amber-hued wine. It's full and sweet, adding some orange-rind notes and a hint of pith on the warming finish. Delicately floral on the nose, this sweet but wonderfully balanced Muscat offers a fine introduction to the Rutherglen Muscat style. Pineapple, raisin and spice flavors persist a good long time, trailing elegantly away on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Caves Velhas,14.5,90.5,"A blend of 50/50 Touriga Nacional an Castelão, this is a firm, structured wine. It has plenty of ripe blackberry fruits that are beginning to fill out and mature. It has a juicy character: ripe and full of sun. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2017. This blend of Castelão and Touriga Nacional is well balanced. Spice from wood aging for nine months mingles with the ripe black-currant fruits. A firm wine with rich fruitiness, it's ready to drink."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Western Cape,Eikendal,20.0,90.0,"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom.

Fumé Blanc,US,California,Robert Mondavi,20.0,90.0,"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Oldenburg,20.0,90.0,"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now."
Riesling,US,Washington,Poet's Leap,20.0,90.0,"This warm-vintage wine is more aromatically reticent than recent vintages, with notes of stone fruit, slate and mineral. It drinks a hair off dry, with depth to the lightly spritzy fruit flavors and razor-sharp acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Branne,20.0,90.0,"Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. It is balanced with the potential to become a fruity wine with a soft texture. The acidity will keep it crisp and on point. Drink from 2018."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Chessman,20.0,90.0,"With black cherry, blueberry, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction offsetting the light dill herbaceousness, this wine offers surprising depth for the affordable price. The texture is soft, yet the tannins stand up to the black cherry, charcoal and black-pepper flavors."
Tempranillo,Spain,Central Spain,Finca Constancia,20.0,90.0,"Mild raisin, black cherry, anise and burnt tire aromas lead to a plump, balanced palate that's full but not overloaded. Earthy baked black-fruit flavors show a hint of oaky coconut, while this Tempranillo finishes with depth and density."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,20.0,90.0,"An interesting vein of tasty herb flavor runs through this full-bodied, plump and fruity wine. The aroma has hints of dill and sage, and these mingle with black cherry and blueberry on the palate. A sleek texture and long finish complete the picture."
Zinfandel,US,California,Berryessa Gap,20.0,90.0,"Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza."
Greco,Italy,Southern Italy,Vesevo,20.0,90.0,"Radiant and elegant, this offers enticing white stone fruit, Mediterranean brush and spring flower scents. The vibrant, balanced palate delivers creamy white peach, pear and tangy nectarine flavors, alongside crisp acidity. A savory mineral note gives it a mouthwatering finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Domäne Wachau,20.0,90.0,"Fresh Conference pear notes abound on the nose of this wine. The palate is sprightly and fresh, with a zestier core of lime and pear peel. Slender in frame, it dances on the palate, displaying seriousness and levity at the same time. The finish is totally refreshing."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Dürnberg,20.0,90.0,"Bordeaux grapes mix with Zweigelt in this full-bodied, serious wine. It has initial severe tannins, followed by ripe currant and blackberry fruit. The wood aging gives good spice character. Well worth aging for 3–4 years."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Vergelegen,20.0,90.0,"The nose has a ripe plum and savory spice character in this sophisticated red. On the palate, cedar, mocha and pepper give it a rich, brooding quality. Tannins are fine but ageable. The finish is lingering and spicy. Pair now with richer meat dishes; give it a few years to age and it will be even better."

The bright, juicy palate delivers wild cherry, orange peel, clove and baking spice alongside supple, smooth tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Mayne Vieil,20.0,90.0,"Spice and ripe fruit, with attractive tannins and a soft texture. This wine is open, generous, rich and packed with black currant fruitiness. Give this wine another 2–4 years, but it could well be drinkable sooner."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Hope Estate,20.0,90.0,"Made in a superripe, dense, almost fudge-like style, The Ripper tastes like a plummy, chocolaty Christmas cake with slightly coarse tannins on the finish. It's Port-like in flavor, but without the heat from elevated alcohol. Drink it over the next few years."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Plantagenet,20.0,90.0,"An easy-drinking introduction to Shiraz from Western Australia's Great Southern region, the 2010 Omrah offers gentle cherry and cedar notes accented by hints of chocolate and roasted meat.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Liversan,20.0,90.0,"A wine that shows rich blackberry fruits, already rounded and soft. It has a tannic structure that is embedded in the fruit, along with spice, toast and a firm finish. An ageworthy wine."
Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,20.0,90.0,"This wine is mostly Sémillon, with Sauvignon Blanc filling in the rest. It's one of the rare white wines from the Walla Walla AVA, graceful, full-bodied and tasting of fig and green banana. Just recently bottled, it still carries a bit of yeast in the nose and in the finish. Give it another few months to pull itself together."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,20.0,90.0,"This cru estate is owned by the Duboeuf family. The wine has some wood aging that adds to the rich texture while not detracting from the ripe juicy red-cherry fruit. With its tannins, the wine could age, so drink from late 2017."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,20.0,90.0,"From the south-east facing Côte du Py, this is a powerfully structured wine. It is as full of tannins as of ripe red fruits. The wine with its dense character it likely to age well over several years. Drink from 2018."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Vino La Monarcha,20.0,90.0,Very varietal aromas of sour cherry and cranberry lead to a fruit-filled flavorful palate. Light oak accents linger on the finish. It's a very pleasing example of the variety.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Retout,20.0,90.0,"With an unusually high proportion (nearly 17%) of Petit Verdot in the blend, this is both darkly structured and dark in color. It is weight, intense youthful acidity and black-currant fruits. It's also rich, full of tannins and in need of several years. Drink from 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Clare,20.0,90.0,"From one of a group of chateaus owned by the Guyon family of Rolland de By, this is an intensely fruity wine. It has finely balanced tannins and acidity along with smoky flavors and layers of delicious black currant fruit. Drink from 2019."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Valdemar,20.0,90.0,"This is a textbook traditional Rioja, with dry spice, earth, light herbal notes and leather on the nose alongside cherry and plum scents. The palate is crisp, elegant and pure, with raspberry, vanilla, plum and leathery flavors. Modest complexity and elegance rise up on the finish. Drink through 2018."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,DiamAndes,20.0,90.0,"Chunky, slightly rubbery aromas revolve around black fruits and oak. This is a dense, thick wine with blackberry, plum, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dark and weighty in this meaty Malbec."
Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon,France,Loire Valley,Château la Varière,20.0,90.0,"Full-bodied, fruity wine that has wood aging flavors along with red plum and strawberry fruits. Smoky, perfumed, this is a wine that shows fresh fruit with a good depth of flavor. Age for 2–3 years."
Red Blend,South Africa,Swartland,Spice Route,20.0,90.0,"A super-interesting blend of 37% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 18% Carignan, 10% Petite Sirah, 10% Grenache and 8% Tannat, the bouquet is loaded with assertive aromas of black currant, licorice, black olive, whole tobacco leaf, cigar box spice and leather. Creamy but firmly textured, like crushed velvet, with a rich boysenberry and plum juiciness to the palate."
Red Blend,US,California,Jax,20.0,90.0,"This is an impressive blend of 45% Merlot with 25% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah from Stagecoach Vineyard and 10% Biale Zinfandel. It comes together seamlessly in a twist of structured blackberry, leathery tannin and tomato leaf, priced to be enjoyed by many."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Boatique,20.0,90.0,"Bursting with citrus and savory aromas, this wine is an extrovert that layers spicy, herbal notes on top of ripe and delicious melon and citrus flavors. It has the at-first almost pungent aroma of oak-aged Sauvignon, and slowly reveals more interesting layers of fruit and spice with each sip."
Pinot Gris,US,California,MacMurray Estate Vineyards,20.0,90.0,"Muted florals make way for a creamy, lush and moderately weighty white wine. The measured acidity supports ripe, fruity flavors of fig and Bosc pear."

Malbec,Argentina,Other,Graffigna,20.0,90.0,"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors. And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop."
Red Blend,Israel,Upper Galilee,Galil Mountain,20.0,90.0,"Made from 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 41% Syrah, 8% Petit Verdot and 6% Cabernet Franc, this blend has a rich nose of black cherry with strong touches of minerality. Flavors of black cherry, menthol, rose petal, violet and a whisper of clove are enmeshed in velvety tannins. The smooth finish is enhanced by a last-second dose of intense acidity."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Réal Martin,20.0,90.0,"From a 100-acre estate formerly the home of the Counts of Provence, this wine has a great fruity character allied to a more mineral texture. With richness and vanilla flavors it is both packed with raspberry fruits and showing structure. Keep until the end of 2014."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Greywacke,20.0,90.0,"Long-time Cloudy Bay winemaker Kevin Judd has been out on his own for several vintages, and this is a fine effort. The characteristic herbal, grassy elements of Marlborough are present, but toned-down, making this wine an easier fit with a variety of foodstuffs. A pleasant plumpness to the mouthfeel turns dry and chalky on the long finish."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Chehalem,20.0,90.0,"Aged entirely in stainless steel tanks, this carries a light touch (7 g/L) of residual sugar but remains sharp, even edgy, with bright acidity and pine needle highlights. Ripe apple and pineapple flavors carry through the clean and refreshing finish."

Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Castelvecchio,20.0,90.0,"One of Friuli Venezia Giulia's little known denominations, the Carso growing zone, with its rocky soil, is turning out some fine whites like this elegant Pinot Grigio. Round, creamy but also loaded with finesse, it delivers aromas and flavors of ripe pear, creamy apple and juicy lemon while a stony mineral note graces the finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Cave de Ribeauvillé,20.0,90.0,"This is one compact package of citrus flavors: the nose is shy but the palate is a slender, taut but expressive parcel of zesty lemon and lime notes. This is dry, utterly refreshing and clean. It's a light-bodied wine designed to enliven and invigorate. The finish is dry and zesty."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Hauner,20.0,90.0,"Made from a blend of 60% Alicante, 30% Nocera and 10% Calabrese, this wine has aromas of violet, tilled earth, mature plum, prune and black cooking spice.

Made for early drinking pleasure, so enjoy soon."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Wirra Wirra,20.0,90.0,"Representative of the solid values that may be found from Australia for about $20, this medium- to full-bodied Shiraz offers a blend of cherry and plum flavors, with savory elements of mocha and roasted meat. It's slightly dusty on the finish, making it food-friendly, ending with hints of cocoa and coffee. Drink now–2018."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Lamoreaux Landing,20.0,90.0,"Touches of sage and tarragon breathe freshness into succulent red cherry and berry aromas on this rich, full-bodied Cabernet Franc. The palate shows off pure, pristine red fruit, jolted by a shock of cranberry acidity and a lingering wet-granite finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Segal's,20.0,90.0,"This wine is dark red-violet color to the eye, offering aromas of blackberry, roasted red pepper and juniper berry. It is very smooth on the palate, with flavors of black plum, blackberry, white peach, elderberry and violet. There is a slightly dominant eucalyptus flavor that backs off at the finish, replaced by a fresh cherry juice flavor."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Château d'Aqueria,20.0,90.0,"The popularity of rosé has lead to higher prices in Tavel, but this estate, one of the region's largest, has kept those increases in check. Thankfully, the wine quality seems as good as ever, with this 2013 offering deep cherry-berry notes, hints of white chocolate and a long, citrusy-clean finish. Drink this full-bodied rosé now and into fall and winter 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite),20.0,90.0,"Cherry, cassis, leather and mineral aromas make for a lively bouquet. This is round and full on the palate, with welcome division among its layers. Ripe blackberry, fig and chocolate flavors finish lightly baked and heady, showing depth. Drink through 2018."
Tempranillo Blend,US,California,Espana Robles,20.0,90.0,"Though obscure in America, this Tempranillo-Grenache blend is not uncommon in Spain, and the results are solid. Thick aromas of plum extract, black pepper, fudge and tobacco lead into a rich and luxurious mouthfeel. Ripe flavors of boysenberry and olallieberry are cut by a very spicy edge of black pepper and mocha."
Riesling,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,20.0,90.0,"Enticing aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine, citrus and a whiff of stone fruit mingle in the glass. The crisp palate offers apple, white peach, nectarine and mineral. It's fresh and balanced, with tangy acidity."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Edetària,20.0,90.0,"Generous berry aromas smell floral. In the mouth, this is plump and soft in the middle but more tannic and stout on the edges. Baked blackberry, plum and cassis flavors finish with hard tannins and a sense of extraction. Expect a very full, chunky and ultimately satisfying Garnacha-based ride."
Rosé,France,Provence,Bernard Magrez,20.0,90.0,"A top quality rosé; fruity and textured, providing a bone dry wine that is made to be paired with food. Bright acidity is infused among raspberry and mulberry fruit flavors, adding intensity and freshness. Drink now."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Ryan Patrick,20.0,90.0,"From a warm vintage, this aromatic offering has notes of candy corn, corn silk, pear and tropical fruit. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors that have a creamy feel and lead to a lingering finish."
Chasselas,Canada,British Columbia,St. Hubertus,20.0,90.0,"This crisp Swiss white grape is rarely seen in the U.S. and that's a shame. Spritzy, racy, fresh as a mountain stream, it possesses impressive minerality under lemony fruit. Bone-dry, low alcohol, and surprisingly dense, it has a pleasing finish with a light almond note."
Rhône-style White Blend,Canada,British Columbia,Church & State,20.0,90.0,"This southern Rhône-style blend is soft, lush and heavy with a rich mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruit power. One-third new oak barrels put a patina of toast and butterscotch on the ripe fruit, with a finishing flavor of fresh roasted cashews."

Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,20.0,90.0,"This is a rich and perfumed wine. Packed with tarry tannins, dark black fruits and hints of truffles, it is firm and full. The structure is still important in this wine, pushing forward around the fruit. Wait a while to drink from 2018."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Coelho,20.0,90.0,"In Coelho's revamped lineup, Renovação has double the residual sugar of the entry-level Pinot Gris, clocking in at 10 g/L. Fleshed out with riper fruit, it recalls apple, pear and peach and is interspersed with honeycomb notes, resulting in a round, ripe mouthfeel that is very satisfying."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lumos,20.0,90.0,"Already showing good focus and pinpoint acidity, th is wine brings green berries, kiwi and lime fruit flavors to the front. The bracing acidity keeps it lively across the palate, and the extra depth of the finish rewards your attention."
Riesling,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"Multifaceted and sophisticated, this nearly dry Riesling packs in crisp apple and ripe peach notes. Deft balance and a lingering finish mean there's a lot to like."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Emerson,20.0,90.0,"Thick and lemony, this is a juicy fruit-powered style. It places its power squarely on plush fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, candied orange peel and candied pineapple. It saw no oak and needed none. Drink while it's at its freshest."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes,20.0,90.0,"Produced from old, low-yielding vines, this delicious wine balances crisp acidity with intense white fruit. It's poised and stylish, with a cool character expressed in its acidity and lemon zest-like aftertaste. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,20.0,90.0,Cherries and strawberries abound in this elegant wine. Old-vine fruit was fermented and briefly aged in neutral barrels that somehow lend a subtle hint of apple-pie spices to the wine. A perfect late summer sipper.
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,20.0,90.0,"Lemon and mirabelle are hinted at on the nose. The palate shows them fully and brings their juicy, fresh and ripe fruitiness to the fore. The body is light and slender but brims with freshness. The finish is clean and appetizing with lovely lemon."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine François Schmitt,20.0,90.0,"Promising juicy ripeness of peach and mirabelle appears on the nose. The palate takes this rounded fruitiness and frames it with intense lemon freshness. The palate is concentrated and fluid, shot through with freshness and verve. Dry and refreshing."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine G. Metz,20.0,90.0,"Fresh notes of ripe red apple and juicy pear rise from the glass and also swish freely across the palate. The body is slender, pervaded by a friendly invigorating zestiness that stays right through the dry finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Vigilance,20.0,90.0,"This wine bursts with grapefruit aromas and continues with vivid lemon, lime and herb flavors on the palate. It smells dry and tart, but tastes more rich and layered, its tangy citrus character persisting well into the finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Mathilde Chapoutier Sélection,20.0,90.0,"This is the third release of the rosé produced by Mathilde Chapoutier, whose father, Michel, runs the famed Hermitage-based M. Chapoutier. It is a light-colored wine, a typical Provence blend with the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon. Fruity and with great acidity, it is light in texture, just hinting at minerality. Drink now."
Chardonnay,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,20.0,90.0,"Friendly, ripe green and yellow apple notes appear on both the nose and palate of this wine. Ripe but fresh acidity enlivens its easy, juicy, textured midpalate. Its clean, sunny and fruity finish makes it a pleasure to sip."
Grillo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Donnafugata,20.0,90.0,"Tropical fruit, citrus and Mediterranean scrub aromas take center stage in this lively white. It's bright and savory, doling out juicy grapefruit, white peach and pineapple flavors, with crisp acidity and a mouthwatering saline note."
White Blend,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Gradis'ciutta,20.0,90.0,"This blend of Chardonnay, Ribolla Gialla and Sauvignon offers delicate, alluring yellow flower, Bartlett pear and white peach aromas.

Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Martinborough,Te Kairanga,20.0,90.0,"A super value in Pinot Noir, just so long as you don't expect a bright, berry-scented wine. This is a dark, mysteriously earthy and herbal Pinot, with savory, spicy elements backed by dark fruit and a long, dusty finish. Drink it now and over the next few years."
Red Blend,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Eikendal,20.0,90.0,"This is an interesting red blend made from 61% Shiraz, 27% Petit Verdot and 12% Sangiovese. It's dense yet tight, with notes of small dark berries and tart cherries that are hit by accents of leather, sweet spice and pressed violets. The balance is superb, thanks to medium, well-integrated tannins, ample acidity and a pleasantly fruited finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Henry Marionnet,20.0,90.0,"This wine comes from ungrafted vines, planted in 2000, a rare phenomenon because of phylloxera. It may be because of that origin, that the wine has its own creamy intensity or it may just be a fine wine anyway. It is rich and full of creamed apples and finely balanced acidity. Drink now."
Chardonnay,US,California,Artesa,20.0,90.0,"Nicely integrated, this large production wine is a fantastic deal for the quality, delivering layers of apple and Meyer lemon flavors within a frame of juicy acidity and balanced oak. A tease of nutmeg-dusted apricot lingers on the finish."

Rosato,US,New York,Channing Daughters,20.0,90.0,"This dry Merlot rosé is the benchmark from which to compare each of Channing Daughter's seven rosato wines this vintage. It's elegantly framed, perfumed with waxy-white florals and crisp strawberry and cherry notes. Dry and crisp, yet luscious in body with a lingering touch of bramble on the finish."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de la Mordorée,20.0,90.0,"Domaine de la Mordorée's 2014 rosés are fitting tributes to proprietor Christophe Delorme's final vintage (he died in June 2015). This blend of 50% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 20% Cinsault is weighty and rich, blending raspberries and white chocolate into a wine that could be served as a light red wine, with grilled meats or poultry."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello Vicchiomaggio,20.0,90.0,"A blend of Sangiovese topped up with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, baked earth, pressed blue flower and brown spice.

Rosé,US,California,The Withers Winery,20.0,90.0,"This crisp, lively and dry rosé is made from Mourvèdre and Grenache grapes. it shows great acidity and a rather lean and thirst-quenching texture that carries the vibrant raspberry and apple flavors right along. The color is a pale salmon, the body is light, and the finish fresh and clean. It's a perfect lunch wine for salads, seafood and grilled fare."
Rosé,US,California,Tablas Creek,20.0,90.0,"Coming from seven vineyards and showing more yellow, orange and tan than pink in the glass, this blend of 80% Grenache, 17% Mourvèdre and 3% Counoise suggests orange and lemon peels, just-sliced melon and frozen strawberries on the nose. The palate is more about great acidity and a stony minerality, along with some watermelon elements and orange rind."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,House of Nobilo,20.0,90.0,"A pleasant step up for Nobilo's top-of-the-line Sauvignon, offering slightly smoky, herbal but balanced aromas and plenty of melon and stone fruit flavors. It's full-bodied and rich, with a long, refreshing, slightly herbal finish."
Syrah,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,20.0,90.0,"As in 2003 this is a blend of Stillwater Creek and Sundance Vineyard fruit. Some complex aromas of cured meat and smoke are added to an underpinning of berry and currant fruit. This is a graceful wine that will need decanting, but well worth taking the extra time to see what it's all about. Retasted 24 hours after being opened, the wine had blossomed into full-blown flavor."
Riesling,US,New York,Red Newt Cellars,20.0,90.0,"Fresh green apple and herb notes flit and dance throughout the nose and palate of this delicate off-dry Riesling. It's rich with sweet peach and nectarine flavor, but also layered and complex with notes of minerals, blossoms and vibrant lime acidity."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,20.0,90.0,"A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32% Merlot, this offers aromas of high-toned red fruit, French-oak spice and herbs that lead to luxurious but still in-check dark-fruit flavors. Tart black-tea accents persist on the finish."
Red Blend,Georgia,Georgia,Teliani Valley,20.0,90.0,"A bouquet of cherry, white chocolate and juniper berry sets the stage for flavors of raspberry, blackberry, blueberry pie and baking spices. It is smooth in the mouth, with a sense of soft sweetness that is neither overpowering nor cloying, bolstered by a pervasive backbone of acidity."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Martín Berdugo,20.0,90.0,"Raspberry, dark cherry, cola and vanilla aromas are harmonious and introduce a tight, racy, pure palate with toughness and grip.

Gewürztraminer,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"This is a big, beautiful floral-tasting wine with rose-petal aromas, rich body, ripe peach and rose-hip tea flavors. It's very assertive in flavor and smooth in texture, with a lingering floral finish."
Merlot,US,California,Folie à Deux,20.0,90.0,"Lipstick cherry and vanilla provide a burst of red fruit succulence around a core of big oak and a leathery midpalate marked by dried sage. Drying tannins belabor the finish, before rediscovering its lovely, though bold, expression of fruit."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Peter Nicolay,20.0,90.0,"Honey-kissed peaches waft from this ripe, rich off-dry Riesling full of juicy, luscious stone fruit and citrus. It's quaffable and thirst quenching, yet refreshingly brisk with a lingering shower of lemon-lime acidity."

It's medium bodied and tightly focused, with a silky mouthfeel and a long, citrus and white-currant finish."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Lamadrid,20.0,90.0,"This ultraripe, happy Cab Franc bursts on the scene with jammy blackberry and prune aromas. The mouthfeel is lush, almost syrupy. Flavors of ultraripe blackberry, cassis and loamy earth finish warm, lusty and with chocolate and coffee notes."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Berne,20.0,90.0,"In its tall square bottle, this makes a striking presentation. The wine inside has the same sense of presence, with a ripe, full-bodied structure that's full of red fruits with only light acidity. Fruitiness makes it delicious as an apéritif."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Castelvecchio,20.0,90.0,"Grapefruit, crushed tomato vine, exotic fruit and aromatic herb are some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant white.

Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Hirsch,20.0,90.0,"A riper aspect of Bosc pear plays about this Grüner. The palate, however, reins this back in with punchy, zesty flavors of arugula, lemon rind and green pear. There is quite some concentration on the core as well as real verve and nerve."

Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,20.0,90.0,"Pear and savory soy notes take turns to shine. The palate is invigorated by a zesty lime freshness and has a slight touch of fizz. The herbal soy spice adds even more interest to this refreshing, clean-cut wine."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Maior de Mendoza,20.0,90.0,"Tight, citrusy aromas suggest mostly orange and tangerine. This is fresh and clean in an appealing but easy way. Peach and melon flavors are friendly, while the finish is crisp, stony and maintains the wine's tasty core flavors."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Palmina,20.0,90.0,"Steve Clifton takes this common grape on an uncommonly tasty spin, starting with taut and fresh aromas of green-apple flesh, grapefruit pith and light white flowers. The earthy palate shows river-stone and wet-cement minerality but also Key lime and Gravenstein apple warmth, all wrapped up in a compelling texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Sattlerhof,20.0,90.0,"Some grass and Elderflower foliage give a little aromatic lift.

Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Berger,20.0,90.0,"Gentle purity and fluidity characterize the palate. There is a vein of lemony, citric freshness but also a creamy note of yeast. This is sleek but comes with rounded edges and gentle citrus and yellow plum notes."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Badia a Coltibuono,20.0,90.0,"This savory, easy-drinking red opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, forest floor, menthol, leather and raspberry. The medium-bodied palate doles out succulent wild cherry, baking spice and chopped mint framed in silky tannins and bright acidity. While it has structure, it's made for sheer drinking pleasure. Enjoy through 2019."
White Blend,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,20.0,90.0,Somebody obviously went to Alsace to come up with this blend of Riesling and Gewürztraminer. It does have some botrytis which gives a honeyed character to the wine. It also has wonderful freshness that gives it such a lift and brings out the apricot fruit flavors. Drink now.
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,20.0,90.0,"Pure Alicante Bouschet, this wine is rich and generously ripe. At this young stage it does seem to have surfeit of toasty wood and hopefully this will integrate. It's certainly not shy, with its bold black currant flavors and balanced acidity. Drink this wine from 2017."
Grillo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Cusumano,20.0,90.0,"Apple, yellow flower and sea breeze aromas lead the way. The bright, elegant palate displays lemon, lime and walnut alongside vibrant acidity.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château l'Argenteyre,20.0,90.0,This ripe wine shows a good balance between its rich black fruits and the densely tannic structure.

Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,I Botri,20.0,90.0,"Made with organically grown grapes, this blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Alicante and 5% Ciliegiolo has aromas of underbrush, spiced plum, blue flower, menthol and leather. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, clove, carob, star anise and a tarry note alongside supple, smooth tannins. It's an earthy, intriguing expression from Scansano."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,20.0,90.0,"For $20, you could do a lot worse than to sample this wine, which boasts plenty of varietal character and ample quality. Cedar, tobacco, cassis and dark chocolate suggest a fully ripe wine, while the the structure remains fine and linear, with gentle, cocoa-powder-textured tannins that line the finish. Drink now–2025."
Muscat,France,Alsace,Robert Klingenfus,20.0,90.0,"Creamy rose and peach puree notes create a very sensuous and seductive scent. The light-footed creaminess continues fluidly on the slender palate, helped along by a touch of flavor-boosting sweetness. But this is pervaded by freshness to finish off dry. Drink soon while flavors are at their peak."
Chardonnay,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château Rives-Blanques,20.0,90.0,"A stunning white with superb balance and layer upon layer of aromas and flavors. An expressive white-flower note accents the solid backbone of ripe red apple and firm nectarine fruit. The medium-weight palate is slightly creamy but not overdone, with hints of toast, sweet spice and almond-flavored nuttiness that unfold on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Alvaro Castro,20.0,90.0,"This wine is delicious with its fresh, concentrated blueberry and raspberry flavors, and the ripest tannins. The wine has a dark and tannic element, although this is well integrated into its beautiful layers of fruit."
Chenin Blanc,US,Washington,W.T. Vintners,20.0,90.0,"This is the first Chenin Blanc from this up-and-coming winery. All native yeast fermented and aged in stainless steel, the aromas pop, with notes of pear, apple, lees and melon. Sleek in style, it brings a sense of brightness and purity of flavor and bright acids. Very varietally correct, it's a compelling example of Chenin in the state. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Loimer,20.0,90.0,"Lifted notes of ripe Amalfi lemon zest play on the nose. The palate has the same fresh but fruity and approachable friendliness. Slender and compact, the dry body has an appealing juiciness that delivers total lemon refreshment."

Riesling,US,New York,Red Newt Cellars,20.0,90.0,"Swathes of green herbs add a blast of freshness to ripe, rich stone-fruit and quince notes on this bone-dry, single-vineyard Riesling. It's remarkably complex, with layers of crushed-stone minerality, lime and lime-pith notes that reverberate on the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Edmeades,20.0,90.0,"With a heady bouquet of berry and peppery spice, new Edmeades winemaker Ben Salazar is showing great talent with Mendocino Zinfandel, producing a fairly large-scale bottling full of intense spice and soft tannins. Graham crackers and oak play gingerly in the background. This is a wonderful wine and a new beginning for Edmeades."
Zinfandel,US,California,Maddalena,20.0,90.0,"Stewed strawberries, blackberry jam, maple, brown sugar, black pepper, teriyaki and pork fat show on the lush nose of this bargain bottling. It's soft on the palate, with fruity strawberry and ripe plum flavors, as well as some more serious beef char elements. It's fun, easy and delicious."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,20.0,90.0,"There's a serious side to this impressive wine, with its toast and biscuit flavors layered on top of apple acidity. It has richness as well as crispness, and a depth of flavor which promises some bottle aging potential. One of the best sparkling Vouvrays."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,20.0,90.0,"Honeycomb and tangerine skins entice on the nose of this elegant dry Riesling. White-peach and grapefruit flavors are ripe and rich on the palate, lending an unctuous, almost oily, mouthfeel. Strikes of steel and acid on the finish lend finesse."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Mas Gabinèle,20.0,90.0,"A blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 20% Carignan and 10% Mourvèdre aged in French oak for 12 months, this wine exhibits great depth of flavors against a tight structure. Notes of garrigue herbs and peppery spice infuse the blackberry and rich plum fruit core. Sweet oak flavors linger on the long finish along with firm but fine tannins. Drink now–2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Michel Vattan,20.0,90.0,"Intense, concentrated wine with herbaceous flavors allied to gooseberry, pink grapefruit and a steely edge of acidity. With its powerful fruits, it is worth aging for a few months."

Fresh, juicy and healthy on the palate, with good drive and dark, toasty flavors of black fruits, spice and chocolate. Spicy, warm and a bit complex on the finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Syrah; drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Robert Weil,20.0,90.0,"Steel and stones are brightened by tones of lemon and grapefruit in this dry-style wine. It's medium bodied but texturally quite rich, lending a satisfying sensation of volume that adds impact to the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Sketchbook,20.0,90.0,"This is a serious and satisfying dry wine with bold flavors, great structure and a mouth-filling texture. It is very well balanced in terms of fruit character and displays moderate tannins, good acidity and no excesses. It's easy to imagine on the table with a grilled rib eye."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Croney Estates,20.0,90.0,"So-named for the restricted yields, this is the rare Marlborough Pinot Noir that may offer some longevity. The mix of bottle sweetness, button mushroom and tart cherry flavors are intriguingly complex, while the mouthfeel still features some tannic heft. It will be interesting to see how or if this evolves further. Drink now–2015 or so."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Bleasdale,20.0,90.0,"Classic hints of mint mark the black-cherry and cassis aromas of this wine. On the palate, the fruit is reasonably restrained but pure, barely touched by dried spices and cedar, then glides to a silky finish. Drink now–2020."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Lourensford,20.0,90.0,"This opens with pleasant aromas of lightly grilled apple, orange blossom, brioche and just-toasted hazelnut.

Riesling,US,New York,Boundary Breaks,20.0,90.0,"Green herb and crisp apple notes lend a refreshing kick to pretty white floral and honeydew flavors in this brisk, intensely concentrated wine. It's semi-dry in style with a delicate, honeyed sweetness that lingers."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Robert Oatley,20.0,90.0,"Despite its moderate alcohol level, this wine offers plenty of weight and richness. Oak-derived elements of vanilla and toast frame exotic hints of mango, pineapple and citrus. With its ample weight and plush texture, this wine is a throwback of sorts, yet it manages to achieve that with great focus and citrusy length."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Tritón,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of oak, asphalt, and ripe black fruits make for a lusty, modern nose. The feel is jammy and thick. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate and mocha give way to a strong oak component. A dense finish runs minty and chocolaty, with an emphasis on syrupy richness. Drink through 2021."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,20.0,90.0,"A touch of honeysuckle meets ripe, juicy pear on the nose.

Everything is shot through with bright, lively lemon freshness, which is exactly what makes the wine so moreish in its medium-sweet way."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,20.0,90.0,"Perfumed notes of white peach and grapefruit abound on this medium-bodied, off-dry Riesling. It's fresh and fruity, offering juicy green apple and citrus flavors sharpened by edges of lime and lemon. The finish is honeyed and long. Drink now through 2020 to enjoy its vibrant style."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Bordeaux,Château Langlet,20.0,90.0,"The small production of white wine from this estate, owned by the Kressmann family of Latour-Martillac, comes from a deep gravel outcrop. This wine is rich and beautifully ripe. Apricot and juicy pear flavors are backed with the wood aging. It is just ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,20.0,90.0,"A touch of honeyed richness plays into the pear fruit evident on the nose. The palate has the same honeyed touch, countered by pleasantly bitter pith. This is ripe, full-fruited and warm, fresh and zesty at the same time. The finish is lasting and dry."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,20.0,90.0,"What has become Portugal's national red grape shows well here. It has the characteristic violet and hedgerow berry fruit perfumes that go with some firm tannins and black currant fruit flavors. It is a wine that will be ready to drink soon, so just wait until late 2016."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Claiborne & Churchill,20.0,90.0,"Almost Champagne-like aromas of lemon-lime soda, lime marmalade, chalk, crisp apples, night jasmine and a bit of yeast entertain the nose on this bone-dry bottling from the Central Coast's longtime Alsatian-minded producer. The tongue tingles with acidity once sipped, with flavors of apple skin and lime zest growing tart as the wine lingers."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Domaine du Théron,20.0,90.0,"This is a ripe structured wine produced by the Pelvillain family at their 30-acre vineyard in Prayssac, to the west of Cahors. It is a fresh wine with tannins that will soften quickly and easily. Fresh berry fruits and a touch of minerality are combined with acidity to form a fine, ripe and balanced wine. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf,20.0,90.0,"Bürklin-Wolf's standard label Wachenheim-dry Riesling has all the vivacious acidity and citrus flavor of its premier cru counterparts but is also starker and leaner in style. Its sharp, angular feel is elegant and penetrating though, finishing with a nuanced dusting of saffron and crushed minerals. Drink now through 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,20.0,90.0,"True to label, this dry, invigorating Riesling is a showcase of Mosel-style minerality. Racy lime, pineapple and tangerine flavors are intensified by slatey, salty tangs of minerality that reverberate on the finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Mas Belles Eaux,20.0,90.0,"Vibrant and juicy with red cherry and blueberry playing well alongside notes of thyme and soft pepper spice. Medium weight in the mouth with soft grain tannins, solid acidity, and a finish that leaves a delicious raspberry syrup flavor lingering until the next sip. Drink now or hold for a year."
Chardonnay,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,20.0,90.0,"Bright apple, pear and orange notes lead the nose of this well-balanced Chardonnay, with secondary accents of toast, sweet spice and nut. The vibrant mouthfeel is full but not flabby, with an attractive peach-pit flavor that carries through the long finish. Delicious now, but also should age well through 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Casa Ferreirinha,20.0,90.0,"Wood-aged wine, smooth and rich. Spice and toast combine with elegant soft tannins, sweet stone fruits and tight acidity. It feels rich, not heavy, its velvet texture gliding over the palate."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Campo Viejo,20.0,90.0,"A firm wine with fine structure and balance. The nose is fiery and rustic early on, then seductive as it opens up. The palate exhibits currents of raspberry, cherry and plum, and below the surface there's vanilla and brown sugar. A smooth operator that shows the Campo Viejo brand in its best light."
Antão Vaz,Portugal,Alentejano,Quinta do Quetzal,20.0,90.0,"Soft-textured wine, with an edge of minerality, this is deliciously rich, while presenting plenty of fresh acidity. It is ripe, full in the mouth, an explosion of white and yellow fruits, with a great burst of acidity."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alamos,20.0,90.0,"Selección is proving itself to be a consistent modern Malbec (the last four vintages have rated 89 or 90 points). This rendition shows graphite, inky berry notes and savory spice aromas such as cumin and cardamom. It's rich and full bodied, with tobacco, coconut and baked plum and berry flavors. A smooth finish is neither tannic nor overpowering."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,20.0,90.0,"Layers of pollen, dusty mineral and spice lend complexity to this concentrated wine full of yellow peach and fresh apple flavors. It's delicate and lithe in texture, yet punchy and penetrating."

The fresh, linear palate offers apricot, green apple, hazelnut and mineral alongside crisp acidity that leaves a clean, quenching finish."
Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,20.0,90.0,White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide. Drink soon while this is at its aromatic height.
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Guy Saget,20.0,90.0,"This is fruity, balanced and full of blackberry flavor, with juicy acidity and an attractive perfumed character. Drinkable now, it should also mature well over 2–3 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Paloumey,20.0,90.0,"Located between the city of Bordeaux and Margaux, this estate regularly produces good quality. In 2013, the producers have managed to highlight good fruit and dry tannins that also sustain the juiciness. The wine is still firm and will take a while to develop, so wait until 2018."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Lenz Moser,20.0,90.0,"Black tar hovers over blueberry and black cherry fruit. The palate reveals ripe, intensely aromatic blueberry notes and firm freshness. Tannins have a smooth grip. What could be more juicy or berry-tastic?"
Red Blend,US,Washington,Wind Rose,20.0,90.0,"An unusual blend of Primitivo, Barbera, Nebbiolo and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine displays light aromas of raspberries, cherries and herbs that take some time to tease out. The fruit flavors are ripe and ample, with bright, tart acidity providing the frame. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
Pinot Gris-Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Cor Cellars,20.0,90.0,"A blend of Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer, it's vibrantly aromatic with notes of spice, white grapefruit, and lychee. The concrete tank aging provides a sense of freshness while Celilo Vineyard's electric acidity beautifully balances out the residual sugar (16.3 g/L)."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Lamadrid,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of tree bark, baked sugar beet, herbs and licorice blend with earthy black-fruit scents on this ripe, jammy, generous Cabernet.

Glera,Italy,Veneto,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato,20.0,90.0,"Jasmine, wisteria and dried herbs aromas mingle in the glass while the creamy palate offers ripe white peach, yellow apple, pear and a note of candied nectarine zest.

Glera,Italy,Veneto,Montesel,20.0,90.0,"Delicately scented, this refined wine offers aromas of white and yellow spring flowers with a whiff of white stone fruit. The foaming palate offers pear, peach and crisp green apple alongside vibrant acidity and a frothy mousse."
Dolcetto,Italy,Piedmont,Massolino,20.0,90.0,"This delicious Dolcetto d'Alba has ripe berry and spice aromas. The palate delivers strawberry black pepper and licorice with a hint of almond. Soft and fresh with a silky texture, this is perfect to pair with cured meats or savory pasta dishes."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Terra Silvestre,20.0,90.0,"Here is a solid, while also elegant, wine. It has rich berry and plum flavors, dark tannins and ample acidity. Already well integrated, these form a full, stylish wine that shows good potential. Drink this concentrated wine from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,Kandarian,20.0,90.0,"This vintage marks a big step forward for this Oregon Sauvignon Blanc. As fresh and racy as a bright young Quincy from the Loire, this sappy Sauvignon has the snap of natural acidity and a tongue-tingling mix of melon, lime and grapefruit on the palate. It's drinking beautifully right now while at its most fresh."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Ca' dei Zago,20.0,90.0,"Here's a Prosecco with real personality. Left to finish fermentation in the bottle on its lees and made without any added dosage, it displays a slightly cloudy appearance from fine sediment deposited at the bottom, which gives it another dimension. Pure flavors include tart green apple, lime, white peach and kiwi, with a hint of lemon pastry. It's balanced in mouthwatering acidity and finishes bone-dry."
Carmenère,Chile,Maule Valley,San Pedro,20.0,90.0,"Despite mild high-tone and mulchy notes, the nose on this Carmenère deals woody aromas, a touch of tree bark and earthy berry scents. A plush, fleshy palate is moderate in structure, with earthy raspberry and black-plum flavors that finish meaty and savory. Drink now."
Viognier,US,Washington,Dusted Valley,20.0,90.0,"Aromatic and highly textural. The wine brings out a lot of citrus rind, tart stone fruits, and leesy texture. There's plenty of acid and hints of an underlying minerality with no hot alcohol burn. Just a little hint of stem in the tannins."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Criss Cross,20.0,90.0,"A distinctive flavor profile makes this vibrantly fruity and densely textured wine stand out. It packs juicy raspberries, strawberries and dark ripe blackberries into the aroma. All that fruit oozes onto the palate and lingers long on the finish."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Marchesi Incisa della Rocchetta,20.0,90.0,"This enjoyable wine's fruity black-skinned berry, violet and baking spice aromas leap out of the glass.

The sediment at the bottom of the bottle adds even more flavor to the last glass."
Chardonnay,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,20.0,90.0,"Seductively rich notes of peach and yellow plum entice the nose. They also bathe the palate in a very luscious light, counteracted by fresh mousse and balancing, taut freshness. This is a lovely synthesis of rich fruit and dry restraint, fizzing away with pleasure. The finish is long, dry and lemony."
Grauburgunder,Germany,Pfalz,Nauerth-Gnägy,20.0,90.0,"While zesty and mineral on the nose, this dry Grauburgunder, or Pinot Gris, is ripe and concentrated in yellow cherry and grapefruit flavors. Racy acidity cuts through the sunny palate, uncovering a pleasant bristle of white tea astringency on the finish. Drink now through 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Vignerons de Buzet,20.0,90.0,"The wine comes from a 196-acre property on the first slopes above the Garonne river. Made from the classic Bordeaux blend, it has been aged in wood which gives the intense perfumed, toasty character. The wine is dense, tannic with layers of black fruits. It needs to age more, so drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Chavet,20.0,90.0,"Produced from 25-year-old vines, this is a fresh as well as ripe wine, well balanced between herbal flavors and white and citrus fruitiness. It has a rounded texture that is juicy as well as full in the mouth. The wine is ready to drink."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann,20.0,90.0,"Fresh notes of crunchy red cherry have a spicy edge of pepper. The body of this slender Pinot Noir is very light, totally peppery and very appetizing. The structure is soft and very refreshing. This could also be chilled and is a fabulously light-bodied but sprightly lunch red. The finish is perfectly dry and very enlivening."
Rosé,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"This is an excellent rosé with some red-wine character showing through the pale-salmon color and fresh fruitiness. It has slightly meaty, spicy and cherry-like flavors, a good balance between medium body and firm acidity, and a nice tangy finish."

Riesling,US,Washington,Poet's Leap,20.0,90.0,"This wine's aromas are bright, with honeysuckle, ripe peach, mandarin orange, slate and lime zest notes. It drinks just off dry, with abundant stone fruit flavors, mouthwatering acidity and a balance that's spot-on."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Tegernseerhof,20.0,90.0,"This still has a touch of flinty reduction. Clean and fresh, the palate does not yet show much fruit. This seems stony and tight, with occasional glimpses of spice. The wine needs some air to open up but presents taut, clean refreshment."
Syrah-Mourvèdre,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Gérard Bertrand,20.0,90.0,"Solid, rich and ripe red raspberries and brambly berries are upfront on the nose of this attractive wine, with seductive tones of sweet oak and cured meat in the back. Medium in weight, with spicy, structured tannins and ample acidity, the oak is well-integrated into the plush fruit core."
Cabernet Franc,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Maquis,20.0,90.0,"A dark, cedary nose pumps out volumes of baked plum and blackberry aromas. A beefy, full-bodied palate is fiercely tannic, while black cherry, dark plum and blackberry flavors are more fruity than herbal or spicy. The finish is gritty due to drilling tannins, so wait this out a bit and drink  through 2022."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Santa Carolina,20.0,90.0,"Ripe, almost candied aromas of berry fruits are offset by creamy oak scents and a touch of olive. This is chunky, weighty and trying hard to keep its form. Flavors of roasted black fruits, chocolate and herbs finish soft and low on structure. Drink this warm-vintage, full-flavored Cab through 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,Trollop,20.0,90.0,"This stainless-steel-fermented white is lively in peach, apricot and guava flavors that are surprisingly lengthy and complex. Vanilla bean, wet stone and lemon add additional layers of goodness."
Tocai Friulano,US,California,Monte Volpe,20.0,90.0,"A deep amber color and a rich, almost thick mouthfeel support tempting aromas and flavors like honey, orange marmalade and toasted almonds. Complex and interesting, it's super sweet and syrupy, but still stays light in weight."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,20.0,90.0,"The aromas on this wine are light and nuanced with notes of pear, butter and pineapple. It's full bodied in feel, clean in style showing good weight and viscosity while retaining a pleasing sense of lightness."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Dão,Alvaro Castro,20.0,90.0,"While the wine has weight, it also has intense mineral structure. It piles the citrus flavors over more notes of apples and apricots, a medley of fruits that are shaped into a firm, concentrated structure. The wine has acidity along with a light toast edge."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Guenoc,20.0,90.0,"Hearty, full-bodied, definitely rich and deeply colored. The chocolate and oak aromas lead to plenty of ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors that come out on the palate and linger on the finish. It tastes big and tannic, yet the gushing fruit flavors balance everything out, and the overall impression is smooth and polished."
Chardonnay,US,New York,Anthony Nappa,20.0,90.0,"Sun-ripened apricots and yellow flowers perfume this lush, richly textured Chardonnay. It's fresh and primary in sunny tangerine and stone fruit flavors, yet deep and penetrating on the palate. It finishes long, with a chalky, briny, mineral tone."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Wolfberger,20.0,90.0,"This is an exceptionally young wine, still tight, textured and mineral. The potential shows in the white fruits, lemon crispness and rich background. It's full of both fruit and a firm, steely structure. Drink from 2017."

It's nicely balanced, with supple tannins and refreshing acidity. Enjoy soon."
Riesling,US,New York,Red Newt Cellars,20.0,90.0,"Lime zest and white pepper notes are invigorating on the nose and palate of this piercing dry-style Riesling.

Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tenuta Luisa,20.0,90.0,"This wine's citrus blossom and ripe orchard fruit aromas lead to a tangy palate. Round and savory, it doles out creamy green apple, white peach and tangerine drop flavors."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Barbeiranne,20.0,90.0,"The vineyard is on the slopes of the Massif des Maures, on the way to Saint-Tropez. This special cuvée is ripe and full in the mouth. It has a bone-dry texture, balancing fruit and spice. This serious wine will be ready from late 2017."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château des Bertrands,20.0,90.0,"In color, this could be a white wine with just the faintest hint of pink when seen against a white surface. Luckily, the fruit is still there, offering flavors of tangy orange and red currant. It has pepper and spice as well as final refreshing acidity. Drink now."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château du Carrubier,20.0,90.0,This is a ripe rounded wine. It has generous apricot and red-berry fruits that are lifted by spice.

Shiraz-Viognier,Australia,Australia Other,Innocent Bystander,20.0,90.0,"This may only be a medium-bodied red, but it crackles with the exciting flavors of the northern Rhône, marrying freshly cracked peppercorns with a hint of meatiness and bright blueberry fruit. Drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Willi Haag,20.0,90.0,"Whiffs of candle wax and crushed minerals lend depth to the concentrated tangerine and honey flavors in this sun-kissed, citrusy kabinett. It's forward and fruity yet zippy and fresh, showing balanced acidity and a cool, mineral finish."

Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Schug,20.0,90.0,"From three cool-climate sites within the appellation, this is a floral, fruity wine with a zesty underbelly of acidity. Lemongrass, lemon peel and grapefruit flavors are the main event."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Ventisquero,20.0,90.0,"Spicy aromas of eucalyptus, juniper, asphalt, toasty oak and berry fruits are textbook for the Maipo Valley. This is tight and focused on the palate but a bit rough. Rooty spice, chocolaty oak and herbal berry flavors finish full and with tannic scratch. Drink this well-executed Cab through 2021."
White Blend,US,California,Atrea,20.0,90.0,"Light but enticing jasmine and honeydew melon flavors give this full-bodied, dry wine a lot of personality, and the mouthfeel is just rich enough to coat the palate and help the finish linger. It's crafted from 70% Viognier and 30% Roussanne."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Sipp-Mack,20.0,90.0,"Tropical hints of pineapple rise from the glass but the dry palate of this wine focuses on tangerine and ripe lemon. It offers poise and slenderness in a clean-cut, dry style that promises refreshment and leaves a citrus-scented aftertaste."
Muscat Blanc,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"A dry Muscat (or Moscato) is a rare find, and this is a beauty. Very floral and spicy in aroma, it has classic flavors like peaches and lychee. It is not sweet but buoyed by good acidity, great balance and a lingering, crisp and appley finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Maison Bleue,20.0,90.0,"This wine is a blend of 45% Grenache, 37% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre, coming from Boushey, Pepper Bridge, Olsen and Minnick vineyards.

The palate is lithe, pure and focused, with a pleasing mouthfeel and sense of balance to the citrus and blue-fruit flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Martin Ray,20.0,90.0,"Apple blossom intrigues on the nose of this light-bodied, low-oaked white. It's both steely and revealing, showing succulent mango, peach and pear. The acidity is lively and balanced."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Kirkland Signature,20.0,90.0,"Full bodied and plush in texture, with extremely supple tannins alongside flavors of raspberry, plum and clove. The juicy beam of fresh fruit lingers nicely on the finish. Drink now–2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Rui Roboredo Madeira,20.0,90.0,"Produced from organic grapes grown in the dry Côa valley, this is a pure, fruited wine with a black-plum-skin texture and firm tannins. With its layers of acidity, it is crisp at the end while remaining solidly textured. The wine needs to age further, drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Matanzas Creek,20.0,90.0,"This well-made wine is fermented in both stainless steel and neutral French oak. Aromas of freshly cut grass and honeysuckle dominate on the nose, while flavors of fig and lemon peel come into play on the racy palate."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Chehalem,20.0,90.0,"With its mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits, this appealing wine is just a touch past bone-dry. Sourced entirely from estate vineyards, it's supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2020."
Roussanne,US,California,Covenant,20.0,90.0,"Aromas like butter, blanched almonds and honey lead to equally rich flavors and a soothing, fat texture for this indulgent wine. It has very good concentration that helps the fruit and nut nuances linger on the finish."
Pinot Blanc,Austria,Burgenland,Prieler,20.0,90.0,"The nose gives little away but once tasted, there is an understated but deeply stony, pear-fruited and textured palate. This is less about fruit and more about soil and mouthfeel. There is depth and subtle warmth, quite some backbone and a fresh, lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Seven Falls,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of vanilla, herb, cocoa and barrel spice lead the nose of this attractive Cab. The well-balanced palate offers coffee and dark fruit flavors that transition seamlessly into a lingering finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Almquist,20.0,90.0,"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (65%) and Barbera.

This is tart and firm without being particularly tannic, so enjoy it over the next few years."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Armida,20.0,90.0,"Full-flavored and textured, probably from the use of a Sauvignon Musque Clone for half of the wine, this is nonetheless a light wine, subtle in stone fruit, kiwi and lemon-lime. The acidity has an electricity and bubbliness that almost make it come alive. It's the right wine for fresh-shucked oysters."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Awatere Valley,Vavasour,20.0,90.0,"The Awatere is a subregion of Marlborough receiving more and more notice for its distinctive Sauvignons and Pinots. Vavasour was an early pioneer, and the 2007 is especially successful, offering up some slightly sweaty, nettle-y aromas to go along with hints of ripe melons and nectarines. It's nicely concentrated, with a slightly oily mouthfeel and good persistence."
Rosé,US,California,Decoy,20.0,90.0,"Floral and fresh, this light-bodied wine bursts with snappy grapefruit aromas that are followed by bright lemon and raspberry flavors. It's superbly balanced, crisp and appetizing—an elegant version of pink lemonade, without all the sugar."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Decoy,20.0,90.0,"Stainless-steel fermented, this lively white shows lush and plush flavors of melon, pear and peach, making it likably fruit-forward. Amidst the deft ripeness lies more complex accents of wild vanilla and fennel that please and intrigue."

Riesling,US,New York,Red Newt Cellars,20.0,90.0,"Vibrant and fresh with hints of apple, green herbs and blossoms, this off-dry wine boasts a plush, juicy palate full of white peach and lime flavors. It's anchored by a clean line of steely minerality that lingers elegantly."
Red Blend,Israel,Upper Galilee,Galil Mountain,20.0,90.0,"Blended from 73% Syrah, 23% Barbera and 4% Petit Verdot, this easy-drinking red also has a sophisticated, grown-up undertone, with aromas of blackberry, juniper and Mediterranean herbs.

Pinot Noir,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Casa Ermelinda Freitas,20.0,90.0,"This is a surprisingly fine reminiscence of Burgundian Pinot Noir, from the perfumed red fruits to the generous tannins. The wine has acidity and, despite its alcohol, has a fresh feel. The wine is at its most fruity stage and will age another year, so drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Casa Ferreirinha,20.0,90.0,"This is an attractive, juicy wine. It has blackberry fruit flavors along with already balanced tannins. Coming from vines in the Douro Superior, it is rich while also fresh and fruity. The wine could age further, although its pure flavors and integration say that it can be drunk now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,20.0,90.0,"A bold, ripe wine that is rich and ready to drink. The tannins, the dry core that just supports the black fruits and the attractive acidity are all balanced. This is an immediately attractive, rounded wine. Drink now."
Fumé Blanc,US,California,Robert Mondavi,20.0,90.0,"From the winery most responsible in America for popularizing this style of Sauvignon Blanc, this vintage delivers savory, lemony goodness, within a light-to-medium-bodied frame. Integrated and round on the palate, it's a great wine for the table."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Kendall-Jackson,20.0,90.0,"A plush texture and oodles of tasty berry and cherry flavor make this medium-bodied wine hard to resist.

Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Cave de Turckheim,20.0,90.0,"Enticing, pure notes of fresh Bosc pear peel make for an appetizing opening. The pear purity carries through to the palate where fresh fruitiness reigns. This is a joyful, balanced Pinot Gris with ample citrus and pleasant texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,20.0,90.0,"As this a tropical fruit expression of the grape, Sauvignon Blanc, though aged in oak, works well here. The other reason is that the wood is subtle—just a hint— leaving plenty of room for the fine pineapple fruit and final acidity. Drink from 2017."
Red Blend,Italy,Piedmont,Colombera & Garella,20.0,90.0,"Vibrant and balanced, this luminous wine offers alluring scents of rose, red berry, baking spice and a delicate whiff of new leather.

Vermentino,US,California,Rosa d'Oro,20.0,90.0,"This fascinating wine has a deep gold color, aromas like toasted nuts, flavors like apricots and a rich but tangy texture. Winemaker Pietro Buttita fermented it with the skins like a red wine and aged it without oak. It would be fun to try with a chunk of Pecorino or some liver pate on toast."
White Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine des Terrisses,20.0,90.0,"If you are looking for wild flavors, then this wine is for you. It is dry, but smells sweet, with lychee, green candy and aromatic spices. It's a wine with a terrific character, needing cheeses and rich fish dishes to bring out its full potential."
White Blend,US,Washington,Alexandria Nicole,20.0,90.0,"Alexandria Nicole's Shepherds Mark is a Rhône blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, sourced from the Destiny Ridge (estate) vineyard. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it presents an inviting floral blossom nose, leading into a delicious mix of citrus, white peach, melon and light tropical fruits. It's rich but never tiring."
Riesling,US,New York,Lamoreaux Landing,20.0,90.0,"This is intoxicating on the nose with scents of white flowers, fresh herbs and honey, layered with hints of smoke and pine needles. Just a shade off-dry, the palate boasts ample peach and pear flavors that are tinged with a bitter lime-skin note and bristling minerality."

Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Château de Ségriès,20.0,90.0,"A fine example of what Tavel can be, this is a full-bodied, luscious rosé with a bit of sturdiness to its structure.

Syrah,France,France Other,Les Vins de Vienne,20.0,90.0,"This wine shows ample weight and concentration for a rosé. Bold, berry-scented aromas lead into similar flavors on the palate, joined by a hint of white chocolate. The texture is silky, lingering gently on the long finish. Drink up over the next few months."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,20.0,90.0,"From one of the properties where Duboeuf does vinification and bottling at the estate, this is a dense and structured wine. While it does have intense, young acidity, it also offers ripe berry fruits that are bold and rich. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Noir,Australia,Victoria,Robert Oatley,20.0,90.0,"Winemaker Larry Cherubino has crafted an excellent yet affordable Pinot Noir.

Rosé,France,Provence,Domaines Bunan,20.0,90.0,"Situated in the valley on the other side of the hill from Bandol and the sea, this estate has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. The high proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend contributes a perfumed character and some structure. It is a complete, ripe and concentrated wine that will age, and will be better from late 2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Western Australia,Robert Oatley,20.0,90.0,"A sculpted, refined expresion of Cabernet Sauvignon, Oatley's 2010 combines hints of mint and dark berries into a wine that offers clean, pure fruit, subtle oak shadings and a long, silky finish. Drink now–2020."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Syncline,20.0,90.0,"Always extremely popular, this Southern Rhône-style six-grape blend is especially noteworthy in 2011. It's a powerful wine that has a broad array of red and purple fruits, plus penetrating focus. This is juicy, forward and immediately delicious, and it also has the structure to age, perhaps surprisingly well."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Barreyre,20.0,90.0,"This is a structured wine, with solid tannins and ample woody flavors. But it has the fruit weight to sustain the structure, offering a wine that promises good aging as well as short-term attractive fruitiness."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,20.0,90.0,"This wine is already showing hints of evolution in its aromas of kerosene, toast and honey. Developing flavors of apple and citrus marmalade suggest that this dry, medium-bodied Riesling should be at its best now and over the next 5–6 years."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Belle Coline,20.0,90.0,"While this young wine is dry now, it has good potential with rich fruits developing well. Dark and firm at the moment, it will become a generous rounded wine as it ages. The 30-acre Etienne Barre and Christophe Reboul Salze estate is managed by the Stephane Derenoncourt team. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Beynat,20.0,90.0,"There is a fine balance between the firm tannins and the ripe fruit in this wine.

Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Thistle,20.0,90.0,"Aged half in stainless, half in French oak, the captivating wine, made from organically grown grapes, suggests buttered popcorn in the nose and lemon rind in the mouth.

Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,K Vintners,20.0,90.0,"A first for K Vintners, this fruit was sourced from the Sunset and Evergreen vineyards, and supervised by winemaker, Brennon Leighton. Cool climate characteristics are shown in the form of unripe berry and juicy acid flavors. There's a slight natural herbaceousness, as well."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,J. Portugal Ramos,20.0,90.0,"This lightly wood-aged wine is rich, with an attractive acidity to go with the citrus and green-fruit flavors. A delicious tang gives lemon and orange-zest flavors and some minerality. Drink from mid-2017."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Zorzal,20.0,90.0,"Floral blueberry and plum aromas are not normal for Mendoza Malbec but are instead exotic, with notes of cumin and cardamom. This is punchy on the palate, with crisp, almost sharp acidity. Plum and berry flavors are peppery and racy, then tight as a drum on the finish. Drink this alert Malbec from Tupungato through 2022."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Argyle,20.0,90.0,"This wine presents an interesting mix of herbal, citrus and stone-fruit components. Lemon pepper and grapefruit, with a touch of Satsuma orange, all stand out. A slick lick of caramel carries on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,Anthony Nappa,20.0,90.0,"Exuberant on the nose, with aromas of fresh blossoms, luscious melon and peach, this wine is a welcome harbinger of long summer nights to come. It's rich and ripe with red cherry and berry flavor, but refreshingly brisk. A chalky minerality lingers on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei,20.0,90.0,"Mossy, yeasty savoriness signals Grüner Veltliner on the nose of this Austrian sparkler. Soft bubbles burst on a creamy and frothy yet dry palate that offers up hints of spice and green pear peel. A lovely streak of freshness courses through this and lifts the dry finish."
Moscato,Italy,Piedmont,Marchesi Incisa della Rocchetta,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of yellow stone fruit, chopped herb and white flower lead the nose.

Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Roland Schmitt,20.0,90.0,"Very spicy, full-in-the-mouth wine. It has just the right amount of acidity to keep it fresh, but its main thrust is towards rich pepper and weight. At the end, a tighter mineral character appears. Keep for 2–3 years."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Palacios Remondo,20.0,90.0,"Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents. As might be expected from a wine bearing Alvaro Palacios' signature and approval, the final product is smart and snappy, with blackberry, herbs and barrel char all making themselves noticed. Good now and for the next several years."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Joseph Mellot,20.0,90.0,"From a small, 15-acre property, this wine is ripe, rich and full of yellow fruits along with crisp apples, with a tight texture that needs to develop.

It is concentrated both with fine fruit and sweet acidity. Yellow fruits are cut with lime and green plums. A touch of vanilla gives the wine a full final aftertaste. Drink from 2017.

Blaufränkisch,US,New York,Barnstormer,20.0,90.0,"Barnstormer is a newcomer to the Finger Lakes wine scene but this Port-style fortified wine made from Blaufränkisch is a delightful sign of good things to come.

Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Hostens-Picant,20.0,90.0,"A rich, smoky style of wine that revels in its high toast character as well as ripe yellow fruit flavors. It is certainly full in the mouth, a burst of ripeness followed by balancing acidity and a texture of red apple skins. It would be worth aging for another year."
Viognier,US,Oregon,RoxyAnn,20.0,90.0,"Nice mix of citrus and tropical fruits in the nose, with a spicy burst on the palate.

Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Château Pégau,20.0,90.0,"This is the rare Côtes du Rhône that needs cellaring, but it is sourced from a patch of 50-year-old vines near Sorgues. Ground cinnamon and clove, fine leather and just enough cherry fruit mingle to create a compelling, medium-bodied wine framed by fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2022, possibly beyond."
Rosato,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Feudo Montoni,20.0,90.0,"Rose, red berry and Mediterranean herb aromas come together on this luminous deeply colored rosato. Made with Nerello Mascalese, the delicious medium-bodied palate doles out Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry and a note of white pepper, all framed in fresh acidity. It goes down like spun silk."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,20.0,90.0,"Despite the wine being fermented and aged in 100% new French oak, the fruit shines through, with notes of corn silk, peach and tropical fruit accented by barrel spices. Texture and richness to the sweet fruit flavors keeps interest high."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Rippey,20.0,90.0,"Chalky in stone fruit, this white combines a crisp lightness of being with a creamy texture, making it satisfying on the palate, balanced and elegant, with just enough ripeness to keep it sharp. The finish continues the theme, crisply refreshing and long-lasting."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière,20.0,90.0,"The domaine bottling of Saint-André de Figuière really ratchets up the quality over its négociant wines, adding much more weight and concentration. This blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 20% Grenache and 25% Cinsault blends black cherry and citrus flavors into a richly textured, spicy rosé."
Godello,Spain,Northern Spain,Casal Novo,20.0,90.0,"Dusty white-fruit aromas lead to a firm palate with fine acidity, minerality and a sense of completeness.

Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Selve,20.0,90.0,"A rich white wine, its toast character submerged in a generous peach and apricot ripeness. There is an attractive lemon zest acidity to give a bright shot through all the richness. Worth aging 2–3 years."
Red Blend,US,Virginia,Lovingston,20.0,90.0,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Pinotage is complex yet restrained from start to finish.

It is lush and silky in mouthfeel and boasts a long, harmonious finish."
White Blend,US,California,Luna Hart,20.0,90.0,"This tradition-bucking blend of 40% Sauvignon Blanc, 20% Viognier, 20% Sémillon and 20% Roussanne from three different vineyards is very subtle and clean on the nose with aromas of yellow apple, crisp pear, ripe grapefruit skins and the lightest hint of honey. The crisp palate is very grippy in texture, with pear and light lemon spray flavors. It will likely age well, due to strong acidity."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Sineann,20.0,90.0,"This is rich and creamy, retaining enough acid and wet stone character to bolster the lush, soft fruit. Papaya and peach are the dominant fruit flavors, but there is much more to this leesy, textural bottling. It smothers the palate in stone fruits but is neither fat nor heavy; quite a winemaking feat."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Ponzi,20.0,90.0,"A big wine, round and ripe with luscious flavors of peach, pineapple and citrus fruits, layered into plenty of toasty oak. It's smooth and seductive, and the finish, which tastes like a dessert of toasty hazelnuts and cream, is especially enticing. Just a bit of heat runs through it."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Willi Haag,20.0,90.0,"Ripe and richly fruity, with chunky flavors of oranges, honey and tropical fruit tinged with hints of mineral and orange pekoe tea. It's a lush mouthful of easy-to-enjoy fruit."
White Blend,US,California,Carlson,20.0,90.0,"The nose on this creative blend of 52% Gewürztraminer, 25% Sauvignon Blanc and 23% Chenin Blanc is quite showy with peach, baked orange, apple blossom and honeysuckle notes. But the real star is the palate that is racy with sizzling energy and flavors of cut grass, lemongrass and sour-apple peels."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de Rome,20.0,90.0,"Produced from three vineyards in the north of the Sancerre appellation, this is a crisp, ripe wine. It offers a blend of green plum and lime with a touch of white peach. The acidity, still young, will soften over the next few months when the wine will be even better. Drink from 2017."
White Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tenuta delle Terre Nere,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of toasted oak, nut, acacia flower and orchard fruit come together in the glass. The firm palate offers mature yellow apple, candied nectarine zest, toasted hazelnut and flinty mineral. Bright acidity provides balance."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Trenel Fils,20.0,90.0,"Full of firm tannins, this Juliénas shows solid structure and ripe red fruits. The fine acidity should help the wine age, and the juicy, fruity character should appear after a year or more."
Malbec,US,Washington,Substance,20.0,90.0,"It's hard to find good Washington Malbec under $20. Start here. Stone Tree (Wahluke Slope) vineyard provided much of the fruit, and there is a small (10%) amount of new oak in the mix. This captures the steely core of cassis, matches it to sharp, defining acids, and hones the accents of herb and cinnamon spice to a perfect pitch."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Joseph Mellot,20.0,90.0,"A single estate run by Joseph Mellot, this produces an impressive ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc, at this stage youthful with exuberant white fruits and grapefruit, and an obvious need to age for 1–2 years."
White Blend,Spain,Galicia,Viña Mein,20.0,90.0,"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Jaspi,20.0,90.0,"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Peter Nicolay,20.0,90.0,"Nicely balanced and nicely priced, this is a medium-bodied kabinett that would make delicious summertime drinking. It shows hints of wet stone, but also layers of sweet apple, pear and lemon fruit, which ease into a long, harmoniously crisp and clean finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,20.0,90.0,"Cream, vanilla, baking spice, key lime pie and tropical fruit aromas lead to a rich, flavorful palate, redolent with pineapple and kiwi flavors that hang on the clean crisp finish."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Muriel,20.0,90.0,"Baked, rooty aromas of sandalwood, exotic spices and berry fruits are attractive. Though slightly grabby on the palate, this shows the right structure and build. Flavors of up-front oak, herbal plum and raspberry finish dry, with firm, pinching tannins. Drink through 2021."
White Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann,20.0,90.0,"Subtle hints of ripe, winter-stored apple on the nose lead to an equally apple-dominated palate that shows soft pepper spice. A wonderful midpalate texture and baked-apple richness are countered by lemon freshness. This is very appetizing and cries out for soft cheeses."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,CULT,20.0,90.0,"While obviously not a “cult” wine, this full-bodied bottling has just what the varietal should offer in terms of ripe fruit, spice, a firm and moderately tannic texture, and a mouthfilling presence. Its strengths lie in good balance, tempting layers of flavor and a lingering finish."
Pinot Noir,Australia,South Australia,Riposte,20.0,90.0,"Tim Knappstein's decision to focus on the Adelaide Hills bears fruit in this terrific-value Pinot Noir. The aromas and flavors are a colorful mélange of beets, black cherries and purple heirloom tomatoes, backed by a rich texture and a long velvety finish. Drink now until 2020."
Rosé,Australia,South Australia,Torbreck,20.0,90.0,"Although not indicated on the label, this is 100% Mourvèdre, bone dry and barrel fermented. As a result, it's not your typical fresh and fruity rosé, showing instead dark, complex flavors of cola, chocolate tree bark and earth. Hints of strawberry lighten it somewhat, but this is almost more red than rosé. Drink now–2008."
Chardonnay,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Montes,20.0,90.0,"Rich and aromatic, with a full blast of fragrant toasty oak and plenty of tropical fruit. The apple, mango and pear fruit that coats your mouth is round and ripe but not too thick or grabby. And the finish is perfectly smooth. Sure, it's a bit buttery and full, so no one will confuse it for Chablis. But in its class it's one of the best out there."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Dão Sul,20.0,90.0,"A properly rich wine that benefits from its wood aging to give a polished, minty feel to the plush black plum fruits. Solid tannins are easily enveloped by fruit, while retaining a firm structure. Keep for 2-3 years."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Lamoreaux Landing,20.0,90.0,"Luscious and decadent, this Cabernet Franc puts a spotlight on sultry black-cherry flavors. The palate is silky smooth, rimmed with the faintest feather of tannin, yet penetrates long on the finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,La Follette,20.0,90.0,"This wine has an almost sweet aroma of ripe plums and cherries, followed by a vivid fruity flavor that's fresh, dry and accented with black pepper and clove. Showing great balance from fine tannins and good acidity and vibrant but not heavy flavor, it will be a versatile and crowd-pleasing pour."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Lucien Albrecht,20.0,90.0,"Rounded notions of baked apple, juicy orange and roses play on a midweight palate that has a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge. Tangerine zest creates tension and balance in equal measure. This is just off dry and an intriguing counterpart to many spicy dishes and ripe, soft cheeses."
Zinfandel,US,California,Pellegrini,20.0,90.0,"Made with just 10% new oak and in both American and Hungarian barrels, this wine celebrates both juicy red plum and raspberry, offering sizable power in an elegant package. Soft tannins and measured acidity maintain a freshness in the glass, with a nuanced, easygoing finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ironstone,20.0,90.0,"This wine has full aromas and flavors of rich, ripe strawberries and blackberries. The texture is both smooth and slightly gripping at the same time, with a medium to full body and a dry, lingering finish lingers."
Red Blend,US,California,Chronic Cellars,20.0,90.0,"Boysenberry, black pepper, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of asphalt gather for a delicious nose on this blend of 47% Petite Sirah, 45% Syrah, 5% Grenache and 3% Mourvèdre. Flavors of purple fruit and flowers are elevated by boisterous acidity and peppery spice that singes the palate and makes the eyes water."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,20.0,90.0,"Freshly cut Conference pear turns fleshy on the palate, juicy and full of life and fruit. Despite the juiciness the wine is just off dry and toothsome with structure, poise and a lastingly satisfying pear finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Lake and Vine Cellars,20.0,90.0,"Crisp and appetizing lemon and grapefruit flavors do their job very well in this vivid, refreshing and medium-bodied wine. Its bright acidity makes the mouth water and will help it pair beautifully with a wide variety of foods."
Chardonnay,US,California,Pellegrini,20.0,90.0,"Despite its unoaked nature, this wine reveals elements of baked and dried fruit, and an unexpected voluptuousness of full-bodied richness. Pear, apple and lemon interplay on the palate, while tangy acidity provides a satisfying end note."
Chenin Blanc,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château Rives-Blanques,20.0,90.0,"This 100% Chenin Blanc is a beautiful exaple of what the variety can express: soft florals loaded with garrigue notes alongside tropical fruit aromas of mango, guava and pineapple. It's vibrant in the mouth, with moderate acidity and a lifting backbone of lemon verbena. The finish lingers gracefully, and overall the wine is ripe and attractive without being sweet or cloying."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,LePlan-Vermeersch,20.0,90.0,"A supple, welcoming Côtes du Rhône, this offering from Flemish former race-car driver Dirk Vermeersch starts off spicy and herbal but adds ample cherry fruit on the palate. It's harmonious and easy to drink, without any excessive extraction or weight."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta di Trecciano,20.0,90.0,"Made with Sangiovese, this shows ripe berry and black pepper aromas with a whiff of tobacco leaf. The bright palate delivers a tight core of black cherry accented with mint, white pepper and a hint of cocoa. Pair this with barbecued meats and grilled vegetables."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Left Coast Cellars,20.0,90.0,"White seems to be the new black when it comes to Oregon Pinot Noir, as more and more winemakers give it a spin. This is one of the better ones, at a very modest price, mixing sweet grass and fresh pear and stone fruits. It would be difficult to identify it as Pinot Noir in a blind tasting of mixed whites, but that's not the point, is it?"
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Henry's Drive Vignerons,20.0,90.0,"A rich, savory style of Shiraz, with bold blackberry and black olive flavors that work easily together, framed by vanilla and soft, dusty tannins. Drink it over the next few years."
Grüner Veltliner,US,Washington,Syncline,20.0,90.0,"Far and away the best yet from this five-year-old site, Syncline's 2009 GV is a remarkable wine. While retaining clear varietal character—light pepper, green herb, and a floral/citrus palate—it brings the vivid brightness of Washington fruit into play, along with a searing acidity and surprising body. All this and low (12.5%) alcohol."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle & Dr. Loosen,20.0,90.0,"Vibrant aromas of peach, botrytis, apricot and pear lead to ripe stone-fruit flavors that linger. Pair it with a yellow curry."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Houchart,20.0,90.0,This is an attractive pink-colored wine that is beautifully fresh while also having some rich strawberry fruit cut with acidity. There is a touch of pepper that gives a dry and lightly tannic core. Drink from the end of 2015.
Pinot Noir,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,20.0,90.0,"High-toned, heady elements precede red currant notes on the nose. The slender palate reveals classic flavors of earthy Pinot fruit matured in the traditional large, used barrel. Wet earth, hay and cherry fruit take turns, although very pure notes of ripe red cherry appear over time. This is an exercise in subtlety and would be a perfect match for game."
Arneis,US,California,Palmina,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of hot yet damp sandstone, very light Asian pear and scratched lemon emerge from this intriguing wine. Rounded nectarine and white flowers show on the bright and tight palate, boosted by lemon rinds and a fascinating minerality. It's perfect for lighter fare, from shellfish to chicken in cream sauce."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Tegernseerhof,20.0,90.0,"Slightly ethereal notes of camphor play ever so slightly above the lemony nose. The palate is light-bodied, completely citrus-driven and very refreshing. Yellow plums beckon between the lemony zestiness and make for a slightly richer finish on this super-slender wine."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Bouissel,20.0,90.0,"An impressively structured wine, this great blend of Négrette, Syrah and Malbec shows intense tannins underlying powerful juicy black fruit flavors. Aromatic, spicy and driven by its dry texture, it should age for several years."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Illahe,20.0,90.0,"A somewhat pale wine, at first reluctant to show much aroma, it ultimately reveals itself to be elegant and surprisingly deep. Varietally expressive, with light cranberry and strawberry fruit, dusty tannins, toast, caramel and a whiff of incense. Complex and lovely."
Pinot Noir,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Ritual,20.0,90.0,"Spicy and dusty smelling, with full-force plum and berry aromas matched by equally potent smoky barrel scents. Thorough in feel, with vivid, oak-accented flavors of wild berry and plum. Round and full on the finish, with lasting resiny flavors that remain after all else has faded away."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Santa Carolina,20.0,90.0,"Graphite, deep black fruit, earth and cola aromas make for a full-force, inviting entry. The palate feels lifted and healthy, with a thorough blend of tobacco, herb, barrel spice and ripe berry flavors. Toasty, spicy and long on the finish. High quality for $20 Cabernet."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,New York,Benmarl,20.0,90.0,"A fine vein of graphite extends through this bold yet refined Bordeaux-style red. It's robustly fruity, bursting with cranberry, red cherry and raspberry flavors, but enticingly savory as well, nuanced by hints of leather and balsamic vinegar. Dense tannins should smooth out between 2018 and 2020."
Auxerrois,France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,20.0,90.0,"This is a very slender, taut, fresh and citrus-focused Crémant with aromatic overtones of aloe vera, green apple and citrus foliage. Showing wonderful precision and balance, the slendern and fresh characters combine to make for a very invigorating, delicious drink."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Tapiz,20.0,90.0,"Stout, smoky aromas revolve around thick berry scents and minerally notes. This is rock solid in the mouth but not too heavy. Jammy blackberry, spice and herbal flavors are generous, while the finish is lightly oaked, with modest toast, vanilla and chocolate notes along with mint."
Rosé,US,California,Adelaida,20.0,90.0,"This Rhône varietal-based, pink lemonade-colored rosé starts with warm watermelon and sharp lime zest on the fresh, bright nose. The 71% Grenache, 18% Cinsault, 6% Counoise, 5% Mourvèdre blend offers light cherry flavors, some honey and a bit of bubblegum, with nice grip and racy acidity taking it to the finish line."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Provence,Château de Calavon,20.0,90.0,"This is a rich and perfumed wine that is solid with dusty tannins and ripe fruit. Bold acidity adds balance and promises good aging. It is quite dry with fruit hiding behind all the structure, but it will soften, so drink from 2016."
Merlot,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Viña Bisquertt,20.0,90.0,"Gritty aromas of tire rubber, burnt meat and herbal black fruits introduce a grabby palate with lightly herbal but heavily oaked flavors of plum and berry. A firm snappy finish tastes a touch salty as well as minty. Drink through 2024."
Chardonnay,US,California,Chime,20.0,90.0,"Rich texture combines with subtle flavors in this full-bodied, complex wine. It opens with mineral and white pepper aromas, broadens into Anjou pear, vanilla and toasted almonds flavors, and finishes with creamy concentration."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Jas d'Esclans,20.0,90.0,This is a delicious fruity wine with a fine line of acidity that cuts right through the orange and red-currant fruits. It is bright with acidity and just a light mineral edge to give a textured and fruity aftertaste. Drink now.
Riesling,New Zealand,Marlborough,Huia,20.0,90.0,"Fennel and yellow plum notes mark the nose, followed by flavors of peach, mirabelle plum and something akin to vegetable oil. This is richly textured for a dry Riesling, with a lingering, velvety feel on the long finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,New York,Shaw,20.0,90.0,"While there was some bottle variation between two samples, this elegant Sauvignon Blanc highlights the variety's more mineral, smoky expressions. Despite six years of cellar aging, there's still plenty of crisp cutting lemon and green-apple flavors augmented by spine-tingling acidity and a long chalky finish."
Kerner,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,20.0,90.0,"Intense yellow stone fruit, grapefruit, smoky flint and nutmeg aromas jump out of the glass. The bright, generous palate doles out juicy apricot, mature peach and orange zest notes, framed by tangy acidity. A mineral note lifts the lingering finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Houchart,20.0,90.0,"Domaine Houchart is one of the top estates in Sainte-Victoire. This ripe while deliciously fruity and fresh wine is full of raspberries, ripe red currants and a refreshing line of acidity."
Riesling,South Africa,Elgin,Paul Cluver,20.0,90.0,"Rich and seductive, this brims with dense aromas and flavors of baked apple, dried stone fruit, tangerine peel and a touch of lanolin. There's great balance between the round, lush texture and clean, refreshing acidity, keeping the palate fresh and lively. Soft nuances of honey-roasted nut and toast unfold on the finish. Drink now–2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Mahi,20.0,90.0,"This medium-bodied wine is tightly structured and bracingly acidic, yet doesn't lack for ripeness or fruit. Guava, gooseberry and grapefruit are all present from aromatic start to lengthy, focused finish. It's a crisp, refreshing counterpoint to some of Marlborough's softer styles of Sauvignon Blanc."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castelvecchi,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of wild cherry, raspberry, rose, grilled herb and a balsamic note follow through to the firm palate along with fresh mint and orange zest. Fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity support the juicy flavors."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Lucas Vineyards,20.0,90.0,"Penetrating tannins hold a tight grip over rich layers of blackberry and cherry liqueur in this bold, structured Cabernet Franc. Zesty cranberry acidity lifts the mid palate, exposing complex shades of chocolate, herb and granite. It's a solid wine now, but should meld beautifully from 2017–2020."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Ryan Patrick,20.0,90.0,"A blend of Merlot (58%), Syrah (35%), Petite Sirah (5%) and Primitivo, this hedonistic wine offers appealing suggestions of coffee, vanilla and cherry. Ripe, silky soft milk chocolate flavors finish warm."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"Wonderful rose-petal aromas and Anjou-pear flavors give this dry wine lots of personality, while the mouthfeel is smooth and luxurious. It also has an underlying crispness for good balance and a lingering finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,20.0,90.0,"Trapiche is doing all sorts of experiments with terroirs and soils, and this Malbec is from vineyards planted on top of clay. On the nose, it's oaky, with notes of clove, mint and barrel spice accenting black-fruit scents. A full chewy palate deals spicy oaky minty blackberry flavors in front of a chocolaty finish with wood spice and minty berry notes. Drink through 2019."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Acrobat,20.0,90.0,"Aromatically complex with hints of dusty compost, peat moss and coffee grounds, this moves gracefully into a lively palate. Orange and lemon peel, black tea and juicy acids highlight a red berry core. This is a totally gulpable and thoroughly delicious young Pinot."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,Western Australia,Wildberry Estate,20.0,90.0,"This restrained, medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon is a solid value. On the nose, cedar, vanilla and cassis elements blend together easily, while brown sugar and vanilla flavors are supported by just enough cassis and black cherry fruit. Drink now–2028."
Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,20.0,90.0,"A rather subdued nose leads to a rounded palate flavored by savory yeast, subtle pepper and thyme. A wine with this sort of textured mouth-feel simply cries out for food. Its zingy freshness will cut through any richness while its subtle aromatics of red apple and herb will complement but not overpower flavors. This indigenous Austrian original will do justice to just about any kind of European cuisine."
Grenache,US,California,Noble Tree,20.0,90.0,"Fermented entirely in concrete egg, this is a light, clear red exuberant in earthy cherry and cassis. Ethereal, it offers spice and plenty of length around a shy body, a bite of fruit on the finish. Made in small quantities at a fair price, it's one to try for its sheer rarity alone, a good example of another light-bodied red that can do well in the appellation."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Zull,20.0,90.0,"A wine that shows all the typicity of cool-climate Grüner. It has pear, baked-apple and lemon zest flavors that are combined in a delicious tangy texture. The wine is rich while remaining light and lively. Drink soon, or age over 1–2 years. Screwcap."
White Blend,France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,20.0,90.0,"A blend of 13 different grape varieties, some rare, this is a delicious, honeyed wine, with rich baked apple flavor and crisp acidity, topped with a creamed spice note. Its pure line of citrus provides a lively finish."
Friulano,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Gradis'ciutta,20.0,90.0,"Sleek and polished, it opens with classic varietal aromas of ripe pear and almond. The crisp, linear palate delivers green apple, Bartlett pear and lime zest lightly accented with sage. It's balanced by fresh acidity and closes on a pleasant note of bitter almond."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,20.0,90.0,"A subtle mix of pear and pepper plays on the nose. A seam of clean, fresh acidity leads to a concentrated, peppery palate where zestiness reigns, made more interesting by the aromatic pungence of lovage and arugula."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,20.0,90.0,"Delicious and refreshing, it opens with a delicate fragrance of white spring flowers, chamomile and apples. The juicy, linear palate delivers ripe Bartlett pear, tart Granny Smith, white peach and mineral alongside crisp acidity that leaves a clean, lingering finish."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Montesel,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of pressed yellow flowers, Bartlett pear and a hint of citrus lead the nose. The bright, savory palate doles out creamy white peach, green apple, pear and a mineral note alongside vibrant acidity and a frothy mousse."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Tierra Aranda,20.0,90.0,"Savory notes of olive and rubber share space on the nose with dark berry aromas. This wine feels thick and fleshy, and ultimately a touch heavy and collapsed. Dark, spicy, slightly bitter blackberry flavors finish with a reprise of savory accents. Drink through 2022."
Grenache,Australia,South Australia,R Wines,20.0,90.0,"Rather subdued in fruit on the nose, showing more vanilla and toast, but this really expands on the palate, delivering great fruit sweetness and nuance in a harmoniously round, supple package. Finishes long, warm and spicy at 15.5% alcohol."
Viognier,US,Washington,Seven Hills,20.0,90.0,"The smooth, silky, satiny nose erupts with layers of lemon, lime, tangerine and melon. The pretty, slightly waxy mouthfeel is not unctuous but has good body, precise definition, and no jagged edges. The alcohol stays under 14%, and the finish is round and persistent."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,20.0,90.0,"While zesty lime notes stand firm from start to finish, plump, white peach and tangerine flavors seem to melt into the palate of this off-dry Riesling. Lavish, yet composed, it's a showcase of ripeness maintained in balance. An irresistible sip, pour after pour."
Rosé,Australia,South Australia,Turkey Flat,20.0,90.0,"This remains a richly textured and weighty rosé, despite the fact that its color seems lighter than previous vintages. It's almost entirely Grenache, with bits of Shiraz (4%), Cabernet Sauvignon (2%) and Dolcetto (1%) filling out the blend. Hints of berries, ripe melon and white chocolate end on a mouthwatering citrus note, but this is built for the beefy side of your grilling menu."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Jean-Paul Paquet,20.0,90.0,"Smooth and lightly toasty, this is a well-balanced, ripe wine. Attractive acidity gently supports the yellow fruits, rich texture and overall generous feel. Drink this delicious, full-bodied wine now."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Waipara,Muddy Water,20.0,90.0,"Based on these tastings, 2000 must have been a great vintage for the eastern coast of NZ's South Island. Here's another top-notch Chard, this one loaded with buttered, toasted whole-wheat bread and vanilla custard, spiked with tropical fruit and citrus. It's rich but not heavy, with a finely etched finish and ample structure."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Argyle,20.0,90.0,"Argyle's Reserve shows less oak than the Nuthouse and Spirithouse bottlings, with more compact and vivid fruit. Nice flavors of stone fruits, grapes and citrus, well integrated and full through the mid-palate. It rounds into a very pretty finish, fruit forward, balanced and true."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Robertson,De Wetshof,20.0,90.0,"This is the midrange wine in Danie de Wet's clutch ofChardonnays, proof that the hot climate of Robertson is no bar to making fine white wines. With its steely character, this is the most French wine, almost Chablis in style, from this producer. Spices, green plums, kiwifruit are all there, as is fresh, crisp acidity."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Frankland Estate,20.0,90.0,"Starts off slowly, but opens considerably with air—so much so that it's probably worth decanting as you might a bottle of young white Burgundy. It's buttery and full, yet possesses a stony mineral quality that gives it balance. Initial peppery-spicy notes on the finish smooth out the longer it sits in the glass. Editors' Choice."
Zinfandel,US,California,Ironstone,20.0,90.0,"A smooth, supple version of Zinfandel, this is full-bodied and rich but not overly showy or oaky. Blended from 90% Zinfandel plus Petite Sirah and Malbec, it has enticing wild blackberry aromas and flavors, touches of cinnamon and cedar and a lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Buttonwood,20.0,90.0,"Refreshing on the nose, this clonal study shows lively and tropical aromas of Asian pear, guava, Meyer-lemon skin and that characteristic grassy note. It's racy on the palate, where green-apple rinds meet with lime skins, cement and crushed white rocks."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Cono Sur,20.0,90.0,"Snappy, chiseled and defined by fresh grass and citrus aromas on the nose, this is textbook Casablanca SB. Flavors of tarragon, sage, lime and citrus peel finish with a lasting wave of mild pyrazinic bitterness and tangy citrus."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Les Vignerons des Terroirs de la Noëlle,20.0,90.0,"The cellar of this estate once became a secluded meeting place for lovers, bringing about the name of the wine. This is a mature wine, showing how well Muscadet can develop. Aged for two years on its lees, it has richness as well as plenty of remaining fresh apple fruit. Now at its peak, the wine is ready to drink."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Villa Huesgen,20.0,90.0,"Zesty lime and fresh green herbs abound in this leaner, steelier expression of dry Riesling. Tart tangerine and orange flavors are concentrated but crisp, edged in cool, stony minerals. Drink now through 2021."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,20.0,90.0,"This oak-aged wine is rich and concentrated. It is dominated by spice from the wood and by generous white-stone-fruit flavors. Still young, this ripe wine will develop well over the next few years. Drink from 2018."
Carignan,Chile,Cauquenes Valley,Odfjell,20.0,90.0,"Another fine and dandy old-vine, dry-farmed Cauquenes Carignan from Odfjell—one of the pioneers of this revived Maule varietal wine. Dark and lush on the nose, this is jammed with notes of berry, mineral, vanilla and smoky, lemony oak. It tastes fleshy, like berry marmalade, and finishes with flavors of dark chocolate, burnt toast and fine herb. Drink now –2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,20.0,90.0,"As with all of the Dr. Loosen wines, this blended kabinett is very fruit-forward and direct. The green apple and lime notes are wonderfully pure and balanced. Drink this light, spritely wine over the next few years."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"Flavorful and sophisticated at the same time, this wine combines honey, peach, orange and clove flavors for an experience that's not blatantly fruity, and not sweet, but delightful. Try it with Thai, Chinese, roast pork or at any outdoor occasion."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,R&A; Pfaffl,20.0,90.0,A hint of passion fruit plays on the nose of this subtle wine. The real strength lies in its textured midpalate that reveals soft pepper notes and a backbone that will make it a winner on the table. Enjoy the savory aftertaste.
Tocai Friulano,US,New York,Millbrook,20.0,90.0,"Boisterously fruity and aromatic, this full-bodied white offers a bounty of luscious peach, pineapple and mango flavors. It's voluptuously ripe yet briskly balanced, finishing on a crisp mineral tone. Drink now through 2018 to capture the essence of its fresh, fruity style."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château du Cèdre,20.0,90.0,"This is a big-hearted, ripe wine from the Verhaeghe family, one of the top producers in Cahors. It is packed with black fruits and firm tannins. They promise richness to come with structure, wood aging flavors and density. It's a wine that is just starting out, still boasting its youthful fruit. Give it until 2020 before drinking."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Pelvillain Frères,20.0,90.0,"As part of a range of wines that uses the figure seven because of its mystic qualities, grower Didier Pelvillain has produced a wine that is dark, smooth and ripe. It has fine berry fruits and dusty tannins that are still lifted by the youthful acidity. Give it until 2019 to fully develop."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Morambro Creek,20.0,90.0,"A good value in New World Cabernet, with supple, silky tannins framing cassis fruit that's just starting to show some evolution toward cedar, leather and earth. Lingering vanilla and a burst of tart berries mark the finish. Drink now–2018."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Ross Estate,20.0,90.0,"Sure, this wine is full bodied and lush, filled with ripe raspberry fruit, but there is also a sense of underlying structure, and some lovely herb-spice complexities, like rhubarb, cedar, cinnamon, vanilla and cracked pepper. Drink it over the next 2–3 years."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,Juniper,20.0,90.0,"A good value in a more savory Shiraz, Juniper Crossing's 2005 features meaty, peppery—even mushroomy—aromas, while flavors of blackberry and black olive build to a spicy crescendo on the finish. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Robert Karl,20.0,90.0,"The term Claret is used properly here, to represent a classic Bordeaux blend, in this instance including all five grapes in generous proportions. It's a sensational value, with the depth, detail and precision of a much more expensive wine. Spicy red fruits, wisps of herb and black olive, a hint of earth and tar, all tease and tantalize, without overpowering the wine's innate finesse."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,San Juan Vineyards,20.0,90.0,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is pushing 15% alcohol, but does not descend into Pruneville; the fruit is super ripe, slightly sweet, open and luscious, with slightly candied flavors. Cherry pie and chocolate-covered strawberries come to mind, but the acids support both fruit and barrel and keep the wine lively and inviting."
Pinot Noir,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Hermitage,20.0,90.0,This is a smooth wine with soft tannins cushioned by generous fruits. Its red-cherry acidity gives the lightest stalky edge and will allow the wine to age further. The partial barrel aging has added spice. Drink this fine wine from 2019.
Nero d'Avola,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Feudo Arancio,20.0,90.0,"Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, this round, chewy red offers ripe wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. Smooth, velvety tannins support the juicy flavors and give it a polished texture. It's savory and accessible and will offer pure drinking enjoyment over the next few years."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Whitehaven,20.0,90.0,"This wine is widely distributed and often discounted, but don't shy away from it because of that—it's really well made. Subtle herb and citrus shadings mark the nose, but so do riper hints of fig and melon. Those riper notes shape the palate, giving it breadth up front, then gently tapering into a long, elegant, citrusy finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Substance,20.0,90.0,"Nine vineyards spread throughout eastern Washington contribute to this tart, earthy and dark-toned Cabernet. The alcohol reaches almost 14%, and in this vintage the acids are quite pronounced. Firm, focused cassis and black cherry fruit is framed in polished tannins. Grill a steak and slice some cheese and you are ready to roll with this one."
Zinfandel,US,California,River Road,20.0,90.0,"This is a different beast from most other Zins, shy and intriguing in tight, dusty, high-toned raspberry and cassis, the spicy components leaning toward exotic cardamom and nutmeg. From a vineyard originally planted in 1925, holding on for dear life in the Russian River Valley's sea of Pinot Noir, it's a rare and worthy find for the table."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Ponzi,20.0,90.0,"Jaw-droppingly delicious, this will surely convince you that Pinot Noir is the absolute best rosé grape in Oregon. From the floral/strawberry bouquet bursting out of the bottle, right on through the delightfully sippable, mouthfilling fruit, it's a joy."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Portlandia,20.0,90.0,"This wine has a crisp, breezy bouquet of salad greens, melon and pear. Fresh and textural, it's balanced with a lick of wet stone to wrap up."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,20.0,90.0,"Powerful, ripe wine with black fruits and a great swathe of dark tannins. The flavors of berries, black plums, black figs and sage are echoed by the warm, herbal and wild flower aromas. This is a big wine, which needs at least a year to age."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Coutinel,20.0,90.0,"This is a young, firmly tannic wine with its solid, dry structure still dominating the ripe fruit. It's concentrated and dense with a dusty texture giving both weight and the ability to age. With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a wine that will go several years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,20.0,90.0,"Red-fruit flavors abound in this ripe and full wine. A blend of local grapes with Merlot, this has a smooth texture with tannins cushioned by the rich fruits. Touches of spice and wood give an extra complexity."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,20.0,90.0,"A fine, ripe wine—very balanced—from an estate that dates back to the 12th century. The Tannat grape lends tannins but also offers ripe, juicy fruits that come forward to give both power and delicious fruitiness."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,RiverAerie,20.0,90.0,"This elegant Cabernet nicely threads the needle between fruit and herb, slaloming down the palate with a lingonberry here, a sprig of thyme there, underpinned with earth and chocolate. It's a wine that may be sipped and savored, offering subtle pleasures along the way."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Thomas & Fils,20.0,90.0,"While there is an herbaceous element in this wine, it is more to do with ripe berry fruits. It has a tangy orange-zest character that is bright and fruity, along with the black-currant flavors that give the wine some good intensity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de la Rosa,20.0,90.0,"A great structured, finely textured wine. The black tarry fruit, sweet licorice and black currant flavors all hang together well, leaving ripeness and feel of elegance."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,20.0,90.0,"With its high wood aromas and high toast on the palate, this is a wine that has leached out the fruit for the moment. It is austere, mineral, leaving the black fruits very secondary for the next three years. The finish, though, has promising juiciness."
Colombard,US,California,Y Rousseau,20.0,90.0,"Tart, clean and inviting, this rare find, from old vines no less, is a testament to what once was in the county, a long-gone variety that can clearly still shine. Savory and briny, this wine sings in aromatics of apple blossom and grapefruit peel, remaining crisp and light. Enjoy anytime at all with oysters."
Petit Verdot,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Ruca Malen,20.0,90.0,"Dry spicy aromas accent woodsy berry scents. A tight focused palate jabs with acidity and poking tannins, while this tastes of lightly herbal cherry and berry fruit. Spicy flavors on a healthy finish help this along."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Scenic Valley Farms,20.0,90.0,"Oregon is loaded with inexpensive Pinot Noirs these days, but very few are estate grown and carry the Willamette Valley AVA. Pretty and aromatic with engaging scents of cherries and cream, this has immediate appeal. Drink with pork, poultry, salmon and salads—this is your go-to, anytime bottle."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Unger,20.0,90.0,"Conference pear and yellow Mirabelle plum notes make an appearance in this wine. The palate, which has some noticeable spritz, evokes more green citrus with its dry slenderness. Yet, it finishes full-fruited."
Rosé,US,California,Vigilance,20.0,90.0,"Not your average rosé, this bottling based on Rhône varieties is a pleasure to drink. Light coral in color, it boasts subtle but fresh raspberry aromas that lead seamlessly to white peach and raspberry flavors. Vibrant acidity perks up its smooth mouthfeel, lending balance and elegance."
Sylvaner,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,20.0,90.0,"Yellow apple and yellow pear aromas follow through to the round, juicy palate, along with citrus and Alpine herb notes. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors while a flinty mineral note backs up the lingering finish."
Grenache,US,California,Buttonwood Farm,20.0,90.0,"The perfect shade of pale pink, this bottling from Karen Steinwachs shows white peach and gravel scents on the nose, proving inviting and just ripe enough. Light lime and faint bubblegum flavors make for a refreshing palate, which offers New World oomph with Provençal tightness."
Syrah,US,California,Buttonwood Farm,20.0,90.0,"This pink stands out for its Ruby Red grapefruit aromas, backed by touches of orange peel and chalk. The mouthfeel is grippy and energetic, recalling again a grapefruit's juice and pith. A perfect breakfast wine."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Venta del Puerto,20.0,90.0,"Ripe berry fruit and gritty oak aromas lead to a full-bodied blocky palate with grating tannins. This is a heavily oaked blend of Syrah, Tempranillo and Merlot. Flavors of blackberry, vanilla and wood spice finish with barrel char and depth. Drink through 2023."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Viña Bisquertt,20.0,90.0,"Although this smells a bit flat and earthy, cool, herbal berry aromas as well as coffee and spice make this inviting and easy to like. A flush, jammy palate maintains its pulse, while a mix of spicy black fruits, licorice, espresso and chocolate flavors end long and lightly herbal. Drink this cuddly wine sooner rather than later."
Trincadeira,Portugal,Alentejano,J. Portugal Ramos,20.0,90.0,"Trincadeira, also know as Tinta Amarela in the Douro, has produced this dense, rich, smooth wine. There are tannins but they are buried in the opulent spice, black plums and dark chocolate flavors. Wood aging shows, but only lightly. This is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2016."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Rustenberg,20.0,90.0,"A gorgeous and well-balanced Chard that's on par with some of the more popular offerings from other notable regions. Elegant and expressive with butter, toasted brioche, red apple skins and almond paste unfolding in the bouquet while flavors of baked apples and pear lead through to the marzipan-infused finish. Full and intense but not fat or overdone; drink now with stuffed lobster or thermidor."
Chardonnay,US,California,Carlson,20.0,90.0,"Buttered toast, apricot, sour cream, Key-lime frosting and mandarin rinds show on the nose of this wine by veteran Chuck Carlson. Citrusy sourness starts the palate before strong chalk and slate notes arise, settling onto tones of seared lime, lemon rind, peach skin and apple. It packs lively energy."
Riesling,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,20.0,90.0,"Racy and refined, this opens with alluring scents of fragrant white flower, citrus and white stone fruit. The vibrant, balanced palate delivers apple, white peach, tangerine and flinty mineral. It finishes crisp and clean."
Chardonnay,US,California,Balletto,20.0,90.0,"A crowd-pleasing quaffer of a wine, this is tart, with a fresh-squeezed lemon palate that also offers anise, caramel apple and pear. Crisp and dry, it indeed sees no oak—it's pure, with a lasting finish."
Grüner Veltliner,US,Washington,Syncline,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of peppery spices, hay and apple lead to dry, sleek flavors, high-wire acid and a citrus-rind-filled finish. Try it with shellfish."
Riesling,US,New York,Billsboro,20.0,90.0,"Glimmers of spice and nuts lend a savory accent to this bright, bristling Riesling full of rich apple and pear flavors. It's dry and light in body, yet punchy and full of zest. Honeyed fruit tones extend through a long, long finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Peñalolen,20.0,90.0,"Up front, this smells smoky and woody, although in due time earthy berry aromas emerge. This feels ripe and full in body; flavors of black cherry, cassis, fig and chocolate end with heady, toasty heat and a rich sense of extraction. Drink through 2018."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Boeckel,20.0,90.0,"Only slight notions of fruit appear on the nose. The palate is softly fruited with ripe pear and tart apple, achieving a beautiful, unobtrusive and quiet balance. This wine may be quiet and understated but it has honesty and a supple drinkability that makes you want more. Subtle notes of orange peel become more convincing with every sip."
Red Blend,Chile,Lolol Valley,François Lurton,20.0,90.0,"Initially, this seems hard and piercing on the nose. The tight palate with scratchy tannins is home to ripe, medicinal flavors of berry fruits, burnt toast and black coffee. A minty, oaky finish is the close on this blend of Syrah, Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Drink through 2018."
Viognier,US,Washington,Walter Dacon,20.0,90.0,"This is quite delicious, bright and tasting of fresh-squeezed oranges and tangerines. Fruity, forward and lush, it's really quite charming. The aromas convey light hints of rose petals, jasmine and honey; the fruit an intriguing mix of ripe pear, papaya and apricot."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Novelty Hill,20.0,90.0,"Done in a bracing, sappy style, this is a concentrated wine with lush flavors of lemon drop, orange candy and Key lime. It's ripe and juicy, with a suggestion of beeswax in the mouth."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Lamoreaux Landing,20.0,90.0,"Delicate whiffs of cherry blossom and white pepper perfume this fresh, fruity Cabernet Franc. On the palate, bright raspberry and cherry flavors are unadorned by oak or spice tones, lending a pristine forward sunniness. It's an uncomplicated but irresistibly tasty red."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Efeste,20.0,90.0,"Quite light aromas of talc, lemon zest and mineral along with whiffs of tropical fruit lead to sleek, bright, focused and lemony flavors backed by zippy acidity. It should shine paired with ceviche or oysters."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Gorman,20.0,90.0,"Aged six months in neutral French oak, this offers aromas of spice, pineapple and almond skin. Full bodied, the palate is redolent with tropical-fruit flavors. The mouthfeel dazzles, especially for a wine at this price."
Rosé,US,New York,Pellegrini Vineyards,20.0,90.0,Perfumes of cherry blossom and raspberry abound on this ethereally light-bodied rosé. Brisk mineral tones and citrusy acidity add to its thirst-quenching quality. The finish is elegantly herbaceous.
Rosé,US,California,Adelaida,20.0,90.0,"A light orange-pink in color, this blend of 51% Grenache, 24% Carignan, 14% Cinsault, 5% Mourvèdre, 4% Counoise and 2% Syrah shows tangy peach, quince, red apple and tropical bubblegum on the nose. There is tremendous tension on the sip, with grippy cement minerality and fresh, brisk flavors of tangerine, light strawberry and lemon."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Bodegas Muriel,20.0,90.0,"Fresh melon and stone-fruit aromas are laced with a mineral streak. This feels smooth, with good body weight. Flavors of orange, lemon and passion fruit finish long and stony. As a whole, this is super tasty, balanced and done just right."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Michel Gassier,20.0,90.0,"Although this cuvée is 100% Syrah, it's remarkably well behaved, without any reductive or animale scents. Instead, it delivers ripe cherry and vanilla aromas, some creaminess on the palate and a long, elegant finish that ends savory not sweet. Drink now–2016."
Syrah,US,Washington,Kerloo,20.0,90.0,"This wine is expressive, with aromas of violet, herb and purple fruit. The palate is lighter styled and tart, delivering a bit more tannic heft than this variety often shows. Give it some time to open up."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Charles Smith,20.0,90.0,"Coming from a downright hot vintage, this wine offers quite pure aromas of black currant and black fruit. The palate brings more of the same, giving a very pure unencumbered-by-new-oak look at Washington Cabernet. Lightly grippy tannins provide support."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Maucaillou,20.0,90.0,"A ripe, juicy and smoky wine that is already attractive to drink. It has soft tannins, ripe red berries with acidity and black currants at the end. Drink this fine wine from 2020."
Syrah,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Monte d'Oiro,20.0,90.0,"This is a smooth, richly fruity wine. Spice from wood aging and soft tannins give balance and concentration. Produced from organically grown grapes, the wine is ready to drink."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Monte d'Oiro,20.0,90.0,"Made from organically grown grapes, this is a ripe wine, very balanced and integrated. It conveys yellow fruits along with tangerine and juicy pear. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from mid-2017."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Del Rio,20.0,90.0,"This is aromatic and enchanting, loaded with very pretty scents of citrus blossom and lime. The fruit blends sweet apple, lemon/lime and juicy white peach. It's a luscious Chardonnay that relies on the perfectly ripened fruit to deliver the flavors, and succeeds beautifully. All Dijon clones, with a splash of Viognier lifting up the nose."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Woodinville Wine Cellars,20.0,90.0,"This Bordeaux-style blend includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc, Merlot and Malbec. A tasty, toasty bottle, it's loaded with ripe black fruits, notably cherry and cassis. The tannins are supple and seem soaked in Kahlua."
Red Blend,US,California,Naggiar,20.0,90.0,"This impressively bold, dry wine could have been labeled as a varietal Syrah. It needs to pair with big chunks of meat or cheese. Concentrated blueberry, dark chocolate and blackberry combine with firm tannins and light spices from oak aging."
Colombard,US,California,Y Rousseau,20.0,90.0,"This producer remains committed to showcasing this rare variety, making this 100% version of it from 40-plus-year-old dry-farmed vines. He lets the grapes hang out sur lie for five months in mostly stainless steel, with a small amount of neutral French oak. The result presents as full bodied, though the ripeness is restrained, a celebration of apple, vanilla, spicy lemongrass and robust minerality."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Fitz-Ritter,20.0,90.0,"Invigorating acidity and crisp citrus and apple flavors shine in this sparkling Riesling. The mousse is elegant and smooth, brightened by tiny, persistent bubbles that seem to disseminate pops of caramel and honey sweetness."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Trenel Fils,20.0,90.0,"Named after a grower who believed in allowing nature to speak in his wines, this rich, round and ripe wine is full of red berry and black-cherry flavors. It is lightly textured and can age, with its structure and acidity giving a youthful freshness at this stage. Drink from late 2016."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Stoller,20.0,90.0,"Here is a fine, fruity, expressive example of all-stainless Oregon Chardonnay. A generous mix of apple, pear, lime and lemon zest combines with perfect balance to yield a wine with real flavor and depth that is not derived from barrel aging. The low alcohol is an added bonus."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Villa Mangiacane,20.0,90.0,"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Colorino and 5% Canaiolo, this offers pretty aromas of pressed rose, violet, berry, menthol and a whiff of ground cooking spice. The linear palate offers mature black cherry, orange zest, clove, white pepper, licorice and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Burgenland,Hillinger,20.0,90.0,"Nutty flavors of new oak signal a more international style of Pinot, but the underlying fruit speaks eloquently of ripe, red cherry and offers glimpses of raspberry. Subtle spice plays around the edges. The palate is rounded and soft but has a refreshing vein of acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Polz,20.0,90.0,"Nettle, tomato leaf and ripe, juicy pear make for an intriguing aroma that is still recognizable as varietal Sauvignon Blanc but brings an individual note of ripeness. Not quite tropical it nonetheless bursts with juicy pear. If you love Sauvignon Blanc this is an intriguing facet of this variety to try. Juicy refreshment is guaranteed."
Riesling,US,New York,Boundary Breaks,20.0,90.0,"While demure on the nose, this dry, seemingly diminutive Riesling builds in power and concentration on the palate. It's fairly low in alcohol, with an unassuming gradation of flavors ranging from lime to lemon and grapefruit, but its rippling textural expanse lends persistence and gravitas."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Canoe Ridge,20.0,90.0,"With fruit from The Benches (71%) and Canoe Ridge vineyards, this wine offers aromas of toast, pineapple, peach and pear, with barrel notes (100% American) providing accents. Flavors are creamy in feel with a finish that lingers."
Vermentino,France,France Other,Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté,20.0,90.0,"This balanced wine shows a delicate flora, white flower character as well as a crisp, tight acidity. Citrus flavors combine with white fruits and refreshing acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
Weissburgunder,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,20.0,90.0,"Initial, swirly clouds of woodsmoke turn into full-fledged oakiness on this rounded, almost buttery Weissburgunder. This definitely goes down the Burgundian route and will also age well. A big wine that can impress in the right circumstances. The seam of fresh acidity keeps everything in check. Drink up to 2018."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Herminia,20.0,90.0,"Sturdy black plum aromas feed into a dense, juicy, secure palate, with deep flavors of blackberry and loamy plum. The finish is smooth, mature and pure, with lasting berry flavors and integrated oak. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,20.0,90.0,"A notion of light citrus peel rises on the nose before a nicely packaged selection of Asian pear, fennel-like herb and lemongrass appears. Thick, rich and nearly full bodied, the wine settles into a crisp, tangy finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Antigal,20.0,90.0,"Condensed and dark on the bouquet, with initial hard, cheesy aromas giving way to herbal berry scents that suggest thyme and rosemary. The palate is soft and chubby, with just enough structure to make the earthy, ripe berry flavors taste better than simply big and bulky. Finishes with a light espresso bitterness. Drink now through 2012."
Rosé,US,California,Holly's Hill,20.0,90.0,"This light but vibrant and dry wine smells like fresh peaches, tastes like white raspberries and wakes up the mouth with crisp acidity. A floral character comes out with the second sip, and the mouthfeel seems to broaden and smooth on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Helix by Reininger,20.0,90.0,"The Helix Chardonnay is a lush offering of pineapple flavor, plus a leesy, mineral-soaked midpalate that is supremely refreshing. It has terrific acidity and persistence on the palate."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,20.0,90.0,"While the nose has savory hints of walnut and dried herb amid pressed apple and mineral tones, the palate is lavishly floral and peachy. Intense streaks of honey are offset by bracing lemon-lime acidity and a long mineral finish. Refreshing and lively."
Muscat Blanc,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"What a mouthful of flavor! You don't know Muscat or Moscato until you've enjoyed this rare dry interpretation. It is aromatic and exotic, lively with fresh acidity yet full of ripe apple and peach flavors that linger on the finish. Great with salty appetizers like prosciutto or nuggets of Parmigiana."
Chardonnay,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,20.0,90.0,"Creamy yellow plum fruit and a flinty edge lead onto a full-fruited, brightly lit palate where all the fruit is pulled into zesty orange and lemon focus. Concentration and friendliness prove great assets here."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Branco,20.0,90.0,"This latest vintage of Falcoaria red is smooth and ripe while also structured. It has great tannins, a dense texture and layers of rich red fruits and acidity. The wood aging gives extra richness as well as spicing up the fruitiness. Drink from 2016."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Herminia,20.0,90.0,"Plum, prune, oak and vanilla aromas combine to form a welcoming, solid bouquet. This feels snappy, fresh and firm, with no weaknesses. Toasty, earthy plum and cherry flavors finish lively, zesty and spicy, with mild tartness. Drink through 2018."
Petit Verdot,US,Washington,Roza Ridge,20.0,90.0,"A deep raspberry flavor is set in a vivid frame of spicy herb and toasty barrel accents. The finish is crisply defined, with slightly peppery tannins."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Angove,20.0,90.0,"There's an attractive minty note to this wine that some may find too prominent, but the underlying cassis fruit is strong and the wine's structure is firm. The tannins are even a bit chewy at this stage, so either give it a year or two to mellow or pair it with some rare beef or lamb."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Darzac,20.0,90.0,"This wine shows extraction, new wood and firm tannins. What it also has is the fruit weight to sustain all this. Given 4–5 years, the wine's richness and smoky flavors will come together with the black currant fruit."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Clendenen,20.0,90.0,"The Jim Clendenen project focuses on wines the winemaker makes to please his palate more so than the bottom line. This one discloses aromas of white flowers, honeysuckle, applewood and a slight nuttiness. The palate shows smoked apple, chalk and lime zest."
Grenache,US,Washington,Maison Bleue,20.0,90.0,"A pretty pale-salmon color, this wine offers appealing aromas of orange peel, strawberry and wet stone. The palate is dry, crisp and clean with mouthwatering acids, a beautiful sense of texture and a lingering finish. It's thoroughly delicious."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan,20.0,90.0,"This blended trocken offers plenty of Pfalz character at a reasonable price. Brined peaches and honey show the warmth and minerality of the region in a flattering light, carried by a rich texture and a long finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alamos,20.0,90.0,"Saturated, inky Malbec with plenty of sweet mocha, chocolate and vanilla to go with black fruit aromas. The palate is big and bold but controlled, with compact, intense flavors of berry, leather and black tea. Smooth on the finish, with soft, integrated tannins and just enough acidity to maintain freshness. Drink this year."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Giacomo Fenocchio,20.0,90.0,"Aromas of violet, black-skinned berry and a touch of fresh mint lead the nose on this juicy red. The savory palate delivers ripe blackberry, nutmeg and licorice while fresh acidity and silky tannins provide balance. Enjoy through 2022."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Vienna,Weingut Christ,20.0,90.0,"Green pear and flinty smoke announce a clean, mineral and linear palate. Slender and poised, it wins you over with a softer, textural core. It refreshes and soothes in equal measure and echoes with satisfying length."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weszeli,20.0,90.0,"Green pear peel and citrus zest promise refreshment, framed on a linear, focused palate with lots of citrus precision. Invigorating and clean-cut, this will shine on a hot day."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,Szigeti,20.0,90.0,"The nose is shy, showing just a few herbal hints reminiscent of yarrow. Frothy bubbles, however, pronounce the varietal character of Grüner Veltliner, revealing an appealing textural element as well as herb-tinged pear fruit. Fresh, dry and light on its feet, this would be a lovely apéritif."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Terre Rouge,20.0,90.0,"This full-bodied wine is packed with fruit and spice notes and is especially broad and mouth-filling. Made from mostly Grenache and Mourvèdre, with a dash of Syrah, it has generous ripe plum, macerated cherry and black pepper flavors that spread across the palate and linger on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Von Schleinitz,20.0,90.0,"Plump apricot, melon and white peach abound are luscious. Yet it's dry in style and bracing too, edged by taut acidity and a steely, mineral edge. Accessible and elegantly balanced, its a four-square wine with excellent value."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Von Schleinitz,20.0,90.0,"Concentrated yellow peach and apricot are juxtaposed by bold streaks of lemon and lime acidity in this penetrating medium-sweet Riesling. Zesty and fresh, it finishes with a touch of crystalline minerality. Drink now through 2023."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Lucas Vineyards,20.0,90.0,"Spice and cedar accent aromas of ripe red cherry and plum on this buoyantly aromatic Cabernet Franc. Dense and ruddy with black fruit flavors, it's unabashedly oaky and forward, yet surprisingly balanced. There's an irresistible freshness throughout, augmented by crisp acidity and a green, leafy edge."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Rocca di Castagnoli,20.0,90.0,"Made with Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, this opens with aromas of dark berry, grilled herb, menthol and a whiff of leather. The savory palate doles out juicy cherry, black raspberry, licorice, clove and mocha. Firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity hold it all together. Drink through 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Sepp Moser,20.0,90.0,"Rounded, earthy notes of ripe fruit are foremost in the aromatic stakes. On the palate they are joined by a yeastily textured savoriness and fresh citrus verve. This goes well beyond mere fruit and shows off the more earthy side of Grüner. Satisfyingly zesty finish."
Viognier,US,Washington,Stottle,20.0,90.0,"At first a bit sharp and volatile, this has both substantial residual sugar (50 g/L) and significant alcohol for a late harvest wine. It's spicy and lightly honeyed, and opens nicely into a mix of candied pear and pineapple fruit, with streaks of vanilla running through."
Fernão Pires,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Branco,20.0,90.0,"Produced from 60-year-old vines, this wine has a great balance between crisp acidity and ripe yellow and white stone fruit flavors. It is rich with a touch of toast and spice from wood fermentation and aging. The wine is still young and will be better from 2018."
Claret,US,California,St. Francis,20.0,90.0,"The producer does a nice job with this concoction of 45% Merlot and 31% Malbec, with smaller percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot making up the rest. Dark, extracted color leads the way to thick, leathery textures atop aspects of baked bread, coffee and cedar that accent the big tannin and flavor."
Zinfandel,US,California,St. Francis,20.0,90.0,"For a large-production wine meant to be widely distributed and enjoyed, this brawler hits it out of the park in savory leather and juicy tannin. Just the right dusting of cinnamon appears atop the full-bodied black fruit."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Schild Estate,20.0,90.0,"Sometimes all that's required is a full-bodied, supple red to pair with dinner. And sometimes, the bottle exceeds expectations, like this one. Blackberry, cassis and hints of brown sugar and vanilla avoid getting too confectionary, framed by crisp acids and fine tannins on the finish. Drink now–2020."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Fowles Wine,20.0,90.0,"This wine from high-altitude inland Victoria is built around acids, not tannins. It's full bodied but bright, lively and refreshing, with crisp cherry and cassis fruit framed by hints of tobacco, vanilla and mint."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Cave de Ribeauvillé,20.0,90.0,"The scent of fresh Bosc pear peel also conveys a sense of texture. This is confirmed on the rounded, juicy and full-fruited palate that balances the generous ripe pear with ample, off-dry freshness. Drink soon for maximum enjoyment of fruit."
Riesling,US,Washington,Januik,20.0,90.0,"The aromas leap out of the glass, with notes of fresh flowers, apricot and lime leaf. It drinks medium sweet with plentiful stone-fruit flavors."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Raats Family,20.0,90.0,"Known for working well with the grape, this Raats wine is Cabernet Franc dominant (85%), with additional components of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot. Forward scents of green pepper, tobacco leaf, cigar ash and menthol are framed by a fruity spice of blackberry and cassis. The medium-weight mouthfeel is approachable yet structured, with fine-grain tannins and a licorice-infused, brambly berry finish. Drink now–2019."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Vignobles Bulliat,20.0,90.0,"Full, juicy and ripe, this is rich with black cherry and red plum fruits that are textured with tannins and spice. The wine, while drinkable now, will be much better from late 2016 as it broadens out."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Xavier Flouret,20.0,90.0,"Made by Carmen Stevens, one of South Africa's first black female winemakers, this is a gorgeous blend with rich aromas and flavors of black currant leaf, licorice, cigar tobacco, boysenberry and black cherry. Lush and creamy in the mouth, the finish offers a hint of fresh mint sprig for a last minute lift."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Comelli,20.0,90.0,"It delivers classic varietal aromas of tomato leaf, cut grass, hay and citrus. The crisp palate delivers juicy grapefruit, cantaloupe, exotic fruit and mineral alongside lively acidity that leaves a pristine finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Companhia das Quintas,20.0,90.0,"This is fresh and juicy while also having structure; a mineral edge to the texture gives power. Acidity and juiciness both contribute to the ripe, full-bodied mix. The wood-aging is too dominant at this stage, so give the wine several years. Drink from 2017."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Vignoble de la Jarnoterie,20.0,90.0,"This concentrated wine has dark tannins as well as perfumed red fruits, blackberry flavors and a dense structure. The old vines give extra intensity and the need to age. Drink from 2016."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,David Hill,20.0,90.0,"There is an interesting floral component—white blossoms—coming through in the nose, and sailing along on top of flavors of buttered nuts. A somewhat oily mouthfeel is lifted by moderate acids, and the overall length and follow-through make this one of the better vintages of this affordably priced wine."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Dürnberg,20.0,90.0,"Ripe, almost tropical fruit notes appear: pineapple and orange zest are tempered by peppery yeastiness which becomes stronger and more expressive and textured on the palate. A phenolic backbone provides structure alongside zesty freshness. This packs a real punch."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Winzer Krems,20.0,90.0,"Bundled, firm notes of green pear convince right from the start. The exuberant but crisp fruit comes on a taut but dense palate that also fizzes with peppery, herbal savor. This crisp, slender wine echoes long."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Judith Beck,20.0,90.0,"The partner to Beck's Zweigelt, this is every bit as complex and structured. It has a solid, firm feel, with darkly tannic fruit, a broad texture and a hint of toast. This is for aging for at least a year. Screwcap."
Zinfandel,US,California,Buehler,20.0,90.0,"This is a classy, elegant expression of the variety, despite its brawn and ripe density. Fruit-forward, with blackberry and cherry flavors, it shows traces of vanilla, spicy pepper and smoky oak. The texture is soft, with subtle tannins."
Siria,Portugal,Beira Interior,Companhia das Quintas,20.0,90.0,"French oak-aging has resulted in a wine that's both smooth and fruity. With summer blossom aromas, attractive acidity and a toasty edge, it's stylish, elegant and ready to drink now."
Petite Sirah,US,California,EOS,20.0,90.0,"Black cherry, dark chocolate, coffee and mint touches show on the nose of this approachable bottling. The palate is solidly structured, pairing soy and licorice flavors with tangy black-plum and elderberry fruit."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaj,Gróf Degenfeld,20.0,90.0,"This well-made dry Furmint has a complex bouquet of citrus flowers, apple blossom and freshly cut white peach. In the mouth, there are flavors of peach, pineapple and passion fruit that dance on your tongue before the crisp acidic finish."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,20.0,90.0,"Gentle spice and redcurrant notes promise a subtle wine. The palate does not disappoint and sings with translucent, light-footed elegance. This is all about charm and ease, about chiffon rather than velvet. Crisp freshness brightens and lightens everything. It's a mere whiff of a wine but a delicious one."
Barbera,US,Washington,Wilridge,20.0,90.0,"Bottlings of this variety and also this appellation are scarce in the state. This one has reserved aromas of red and blue fruit along with whiffs of spice. The plump, tangy flavors show a pleasing purity, trailing a bit toward the finish. Try it with pasta with a red sauce."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Hermann,20.0,90.0,"Swirls of penetrating peach and honey flavors pack a mighty punch in this dazzling, sunny sip. Off dry in style, it's an easy going yet elegant wine accented by saffron, blossoms and reverberating tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Max Ferd. Richter,20.0,90.0,"Puckery lime and lemon flavors collide into lavish streaks of honey and marmalade in this penetrating, lip-smacking kabinett. Delicately composed with the faintest hint of sweetness, it reverberates through a high-toned, tangerine finish. Drink now through 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,20.0,90.0,"This is a rounded, ripe wine that exudes black fruits, soft tannins and juicy acidity. It is fresh, tight with a mineral texture. The six months of wood aging has served to tame the firmest tannins. That means this approachable wine is ready to drink just for its freshness and fruitiness, although it will be even better from early 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Portugal,Tejo,Fiuza,20.0,90.0,"This is a tannic while richly fruity wine, showing ripe warm-climate Cabernet Sauvignon flavors. Blackberries and dusty tannins are to the fore, giving a firm structure, fine juiciness and a dense texture. The wine could age, so drink from 2016."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Rimauresq,20.0,90.0,"A delicious, crisp and fruity wine that's textured with minerality and a tang of lemon zest. On the palate a raspberry flavor dominates, with layers of acidity and a lively, bright aftertaste."
Cabernet Franc,Chile,Maule Valley,Odfjell,20.0,90.0,"Dark as night, with aromas of brick dust, kirsch and black fruit. Don't expect anything like French Cab Franc from this Chilean monster. It's huge and fully directed toward blackberry and cassis. Which means the herbal, leafy, tobacco notes common to CF are simply not present here. But if you like yours big and burly, with crusty dark fruit, then this is your ticket."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Santa Rita,20.0,90.0,"Few $20 Cabs from anywhere are going to deliver like Medalla Real does. From first impressions, which include aromas of toast, coffee, prune and devilish berry, you know it's a good one. The feel is generous and the balance spot on, so the plum, berry, coffee and chocolate flavors have structure and support. A complete wine with length, mint and lavish tannins."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Soos Creek,20.0,90.0,"The Sundance blend in 2006 is two-thirds Merlot, the other third splits Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's what the winemaker modestly describes as his “leftovers,” but like the best leftovers it tastes great. It's wide open and broadly appealing, with sweet and soft fruit flavors of ripe berries, cherries and milk chocolate. Along with the ripe, fresh fruit are soft tannins and some pleasing streaks of coffee and licorice."
Viognier,South Africa,Paarl,Ridgeback,20.0,90.0,"Here's a gorgeous Viognier that is showing very well. Soft toasted brioche topped with baked red apple, ginger and orange clove spice aromas transition into flavors of spiced peach and orange oil in the full mouth. Well balanced with a long, spicy finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,20.0,90.0,"A vein of chalky minerality extends through this dry, briskly structured wine, lending intensity and edge to softer, honeyed tones of peaches and apricots. It's vital and fresh yet persistent on the finish. Drink now through 2019."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaj,Béres,20.0,90.0,"This zesty dry Furmint leads the way with aromas of lemon juice and freshly cut pineapple. It has delightful flavors of apple, peach and Bartlett pear with a nice amount of heft on the palate. There's a great deal of minerality and the finish is creamy and brisk at the same time."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Burgo Viejo,20.0,90.0,"Dense fairly bold blackberry and dark plum aromas are backed by a plump palate that's braced by a beam of core acidity. Earthy berry flavors come with notes of vanilla, wild herbs and tobacco, while the finish is full and weighty but also juicy. Drink through 2020."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Jim Barry,20.0,90.0,"This juicy, medium-bodied Shiraz is filled with mouthwatering cherry-berry fruit. Some silky tannins provide structure, but this is much more about the here and now than any sort of cellaring. The fruit persists through the finish, joined by hints of herbs and bacon. Drink now–2020."
Merlot,US,California,Maddalena,20.0,90.0,"This very fairly priced wine from the fourth-generation winemaking family behind San Antonio Winery delivers aromas of black cherry-crusted charred meats with significant mint character. It's dense on the palate and quite tannic, but quite nice with blackberry paste, licorice and tanned leather flavors."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Clos de los Siete,20.0,90.0,"Blueberry and cardamom aromas rank as exotic and attractive. This has a rich, jammy, deep body that's easy on the palate. Flavors of blackberry, caramel and chocolate are rich and ripe, as is the finish, which has a meaty texture and a touch of youthful heat."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Israel,Galilee,Carmel,20.0,90.0,"This versatile, food-friendly blend is a great value that's perfect for entertaining. Scents of brambly berry and black plum skin immediately unfold on the nose, while dense notes of cassis and blackberry take center stage on the palate. Balanced and accessible, the crushed satin texture is framed with medium tannins and lush, rich fruit flavors that stay through the long cocoa-kissed finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Markus Molitor,20.0,90.0,"Whiffs of sweet pastry and sun-kissed nectarines lend richness to this zesty, off-dry Riesling. Sweet and tart, it's lip smackingly juicy, finishing on a deliciously astringent lemon pith note. Drink now through 2017."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Ponzi,20.0,90.0,"As sure-fire as the sunrise, Ponzi's Pinot Noir Rosé is always a class act. The floral, strawberry and peppercorn aromas set your mouth watering before the first sip. There's sufficient acidity to take a bit of a chill-down in stride, and the finish, though bone dry, has ample fruit sweetness to round out the mouthfeel."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Primus,20.0,90.0,"Lightly roasted, leathery berry aromas are oaky but not overly woody or resiny. A dense, concentrated palate is creamy but appropriate in feel, while flavors of black cherry, cassis, baking spices, vanilla and caramel end in a lasting swirl of licorice, nutmeg and cocoa powder flavors."
Viognier,US,Washington,Bergevin Lane,20.0,90.0,"The 8% splash of Roussanne in this blend, contributes to the lovely complexity of the opening aromas. Sweet citrus, honey and tea flavors combine, while keeping the palate light and focused. Complex hints of lemon meringue, vanilla cream and toasted coconut keep it lively and interesting through to the finish."
Primitivo,US,California,Uvaggio,20.0,90.0,"Made in a completely different style from Uvaggio's typical Primitivo, this is meant to be a reserve-tier bottling, with seven months in new and once-used oak. Crisp berry flavor, along with a hint of cranberry, makes this juicy and balanced. It finishes softly on a slightly nutty note."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,Marotti Campi,20.0,90.0,"This lovely Verdicchio has the wine's trademark floral fragrance of broom and acacia flowers, along with a whiff of beeswax. The rich palate boasts creamy apple, yellow peach and tropical fruit flavors accompanied by energizing mineral notes and crisp acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,District 7 Wines,20.0,90.0,"This bottling by the Scheid family of wines is a solidly reliable deal, with dried black cherries, beef jerky, leather and a bit of tar on the nose. Crushed, dried herbs show on the palate, along with roasted pork and more black cherry, proving both juicy and meaty, with a slate-driven minerality."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,River's Edge,20.0,90.0,"Nicely aromatic, this offers scents and follow-up flavors of cherry cola, with a dusting of sweet hay. It's authoritative without being over-amped—the classic iron fist in the velvet glove. Notes of earth and iron add interest to the finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Maison Saint Aix,20.0,90.0,"Rich and lightly structured, this wine is shot through with bright acidity that offers a crisp, tight aftertaste. The red fruits flourish happily at the end."
White Blend,US,California,Uvaggio,20.0,90.0,"This intriguing combination of Pinot Grigio (70%) holds smaller traces of Traminer and Moscato Giallo. The nose is powerfully led by the Moscato, so floral and spicy in jasmine and briny seaside that it almost suggests Vermentino. Textured and light, it offers strong flavors of pear and a long, crisp finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Reata,20.0,90.0,"This wine delivers a full-figured spectrum of flavor and texture, including apple, pear and honeyed caramel notes. Supportive oak plays nicely in the background as the finish winds down softly."
Chenin Blanc,Portugal,Portuguese Table Wine,Ribafreixo,20.0,90.0,"Well, who thought Chenin Blanc would end up in the Alentejo? Obviously not the guardian of the wine rules, which is why this classified as a mere table wine. However, the grape, perfumed and ripe in this warm climate, still weaves its magic to give a very fine wine with tropical fruit, a touch of honey and fine crisp acidity at the end. Drink this wine from late 2017."
White Blend,US,California,Skinner,20.0,90.0,"Bosc pear, tart apple and vanilla bean elements make this a fascinating dry wine. Although the aromas are inviting, the first sip tastes austere. But as it opens, the palate and gains more concentration and complexity, proving sophisticated, layered and nuanced."
Colombard,US,California,Y Rousseau,20.0,90.0,"Waxy pear flavors ride a lush texture of supportive acidity in this rare white from dry-farmed vines planted more than four decades ago. Food-friendly and light on its feet, it's the perfect picnic wine, ready for charcuterie and cheese."
Riesling,France,Alsace,André Kientzler,20.0,90.0,"Sun ripened mirabelle notes entice the nose and continue on the palate, where they are joined by an earthy edge as well as a pervasive lemon freshness. This is slender and fresh, dry and very energetic. The finish is lip-smacking and moreish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine de Mourchon,20.0,90.0,"From a somewhat maligned vintage, this is a commendable effort. It's not as textural as the wine can be in better years, but it shows enough richness to easily carry the attractive leather, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now–2025."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Rioja Vega,20.0,90.0,"Widely available Rioja Crianzas don't come much better than this. An opening of raspberry and strawberry aromas backed by direct cherry, raspberry and red-plum flavors render this all about fruit and freshness."
White Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Hafner,20.0,90.0,"Harvested in January 2007, this has the true purity and freshness of icewine. There is lightness and delicacy as the ripe apricot sweetness is pierced with floating acidity. There is a sweet, but fresh and clean finish."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Wines & Winemakers,20.0,90.0,"Pure Alvarinho from the north of the Vinho Verde region makes this a smooth, ripe wine. It is perfumed, stylish and with a good balance between acidity and refreshing green and white fruitiness. Drink the wine now."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Amalie Robert,20.0,90.0,"This lovely rosé brings a complex mix of citrus, strawberry and melon flavors, etched with vivid acidity. It's poised, balanced and clean in style—a great example of how a seemingly simple wine can surprise with unexpected depth."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Matheus,20.0,90.0,"Buoyant primary aromas of sunny peach and tangerine are juxtaposed against deep reverberating slate and flint in this gorgeously balanced Kabinett. It's lusciously textured but spine-tingling with acidity. The finish is long, lingering on warm spice tones. Drink now through 2020."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,David Hill,20.0,90.0,"Produced from vines a half century old, this is fermented completely dry yet retains a distinct floral/talc character. Although Alsatian in style it, exudes a bit of extra fruit flesh, as one would expect of Oregon. It's a lovely wine, with rose petal scents and light peach flavors."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Ghost Hill,20.0,90.0,"The word scrumptious applies here. This rich and complex rosé from Eric Hamacher is a mix of saignée juice and Pinot Noir blanc that wasn't quite blanc enough—a happy accident, since it's packed with raspberry confit and plum jam flavors, with a hint of cranberry sauce. Coming up on two years past fermentation, it's a wine to drink now."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,Herdade do Rocim,20.0,90.0,"The crisp Vital grape, local to the Lisboa region, is obvious in this light and bright wine. It has a wonderful tangy character, with delicious acidity. Full of citrus and green plums, it offers a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
Barbera,US,California,Uvaggio,20.0,90.0,"If only more California Barbera could be like this. Opening with a pretty, yet rich fruit nose of dark cherry and plum, the structured wine has been tamed into a soft, chocolate-brushed finish with just the perfect amount of acidity. The vines have been in the ground since the 1880s. Winemaker Jim Moore adds just a thimble's worth (3%) of Nebbiolo too, before letting it all age in oak."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Carmel,20.0,90.0,"Violet, blackberry, cassis and blueberry aromas immediately waft from the glass. Rich and ripe, the palate boasts more of the same concentrated fruit in a lush, creamy, crushed-velvet-like texture. Notes of charred espresso bean, vanilla pod and licorice root all unfold on the long finish. Balanced, delicious and affordable."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Vienna,Wieninger,20.0,90.0,"While this Grüner does not give away too much on its rather closed nose, the savory hints of pepper, arugula, pear and thyme unite beautifully and insistingly on the midpalate. The wine gets full marks for refreshing, authentic typicity."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Terras Gauda,20.0,90.0,"This is an ideal summer white. It's light but crisp on the bouquet, with whispy pear, apple and citrus aromas. Freshness reigns on the palate despite there being pulpy citrus flavors. Another wave of citrus carries the clear finish to a precise ending. Delicious white wine."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Kilikanoon,20.0,90.0,"Lime sherbet and wet-stone aromas are classic for the variety and region. This is a light- to medium-bodied wine, dry, with high acidity that drives it through a long, zesty finish. Drink it now with raw oysters or ceviche, or cellar it another five years to develop greater weight and complexity."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Henri Bonnaud,20.0,90.0,"This is a pretty wine with its elegant pale color and delicious fruit. Made from organically grown Grenache (85%) and Cinsault (15%), it is crisp, full of fresh red currant fruit and has a nervy, very fresh aftertaste."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria di Magliano,20.0,90.0,"Vibrant and delicious, this has aromas of violet, red berry and a whiff of peppercorn. The sleek, savory palate doles out crunchy wild cherry, crushed raspberry and spicy herb alongside silky, supple tannins and bright acidity. This is all about sheer drinking pleasure, so enjoy over the next few years."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Le Pupille,20.0,90.0,"This vibrant, sunny wine opens with aromas of blue flower, red berry and a whiff of Mediterranean brush. The elegant palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry and hints of white pepper and herbs alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the juicy fruit."
Carmenère,Chile,Maule Valley,San Pedro,20.0,90.0,"Herbal aromas of green tobacco, black fruits and coffee grounds require some understanding of Carmenère to fully appreciate. A chunky, saturated palate is thick but balanced by tartaric acidity. Herbal, minty blackberry flavors are woody and show a hint of graphite, while coffee, carob and burnt toast flavors blend with green notes on the finish. Drink through 2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Balletto,20.0,90.0,"This is an estate-grown white, unfettered by oak, that opts instead to focus on floral apple-blossom aromas and bright, fresh flavors of tangerine and grapefruit zest. A bite of green apple shines on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Laulerie,20.0,90.0,"This wood-aged blend of Merlot and Malbec comes from the range of hills that continue from Saint-Emilion and Castillon in Bordeaux. There are similarities in the richness of this wine giving a fine balance between fruit and acidity. The tannins and the spice from wood aging are showing well, suggesting the wine will age. Drink from 2019."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine de la Sanglière,20.0,90.0,"The top wine in the Sanglière range is delicious. With its finely balanced fruit and acidity, it is bright with orange and red-currant crispness as well as a warmer sunny character. With its final acidity it is a great food wine. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Vigilance,20.0,90.0,"Citrus and herb aromas and crisp, inviting flavors make this medium-bodied wine hard to resist. Nicely dry, well balanced and lively with acidity, it has a lingering finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Shannon Ridge,20.0,90.0,"Beefy aromas and flavors complement ample blackberry and cranberry notes in this firm-textured, well-balanced and nicely layered wine that's based on Zinfandel and Syrah. It's concentrated without being too full bodied, with good length on the finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,LangeTwins,20.0,90.0,"This lush and aromatic wine has beautiful rose-petal aromas and vibrant grapefruit flavors that spread across the palate and linger nicely on the finish. Rather full bodied, it is rich enough to serve with strong cheeses and roasted birds."
Sémillon,Australia,New South Wales,Brokenwood,20.0,90.0,"Like most young Hunter Valley Semillons, this is starting out on the neutral, acidic side. Notes of melon and citrus rind only hint at the potential to be found in a few years' time. It's a little weightier than expected, with a silky mouthfeel and a long, gentle, lime-riddled finish."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"Smooth and graceful, subtle and delicious, this wine comes from an old pro with Alsace varietals and shows a deft touch and great balance. Wonderful peach and Bosc pear flavors mingle on a smooth texture and linger on the finish."
Moscato,Italy,Piedmont,Scagliola,20.0,90.0,"Enticing scents of fragrant white flower, apricot, pineapple and a whiff of wild herb float out of the glass. On the rich frothy palate, notes of sage and candied lemon drop accent ripe apricot and yellow peach alongside a softly foaming mousse. It finishes bright and clean."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Sierra Starr,20.0,90.0,"The floral aromas and tangy grapefruit flavors of this medium-bodied wine are wonderfully vivid. It tastes nicely concentrated, becomes riper with each sip, and has a lingering finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Métairie Neuve,20.0,90.0,"From a 34-acre property that has vines both in Blaye and Bourg, this is concentrated, showing the ripe, generous fruit of the vintage. Still youthful, its blackberry juiciness lies behind its wood-aging flavors. Drink from 2020."
Rosé,France,France Other,Domaine Vico,20.0,90.0,This domaine—situated at a higher altitude than most Corsican vineyards—produces wines with an extra zest of freshness. This bottling is crisp and tight yet has great swathes of red fruit and balanced acidity. Drink now.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Elevation Cellars,20.0,90.0,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 19% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot is sourced from the Hedges, Stillwater, and Conner Lee vineyards. At first soft and smooth, it morphs into a textural wine with a mouthful of purple and black fruits—from blackberry on through cassis. Streaks of smoke, graphite and espresso highlight the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maipo Valley,Haras,20.0,90.0,"Whether you call the winery Haras or Haras de Pirque, this Character Cabernet is the real deal. It's earthy and round, with almond, moss, blueberry and boysenberry on the well-oaked bouquet. Comes across juicy and ripe, with layered plum, blackberry and black olive flavors. Smooth on the finish, with a dark, mildly herbal salutation."
Shiraz,Spain,Levante,Enrique Mendoza,20.0,90.0,"The packaging is underwhelming, so much so that you worry that this is just another generic Shiraz from whereversville. But that's not the case at all. The wine is sexy and smooth, with light minty aromas accenting solid berry fruit. The palate is clean and zesty, with dark-fruit flavors as well as black olive, cola and toast. Integrated and ready to drink."
White Blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Wieninger,20.0,90.0,"Green and yellow apples mingle with yeasty savoriness. The slender palate rings with an earthy tang and lemon overtones. A central thread of lemony freshness sets a bright, friendly tone. This is aromatic, fresh and utterly gluggable. Nothing less than Vienna in a glass."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Page Cellars,20.0,90.0,"Don't look for grassy or herbaceous flavors, because there is not a trace of either. This is a stand-alone style that turns the usually snarly, gooseberry-flavored Sauvignon Blanc grape into a honeyed pussycat, ripe and   tropical and slightly sweet, with a toffee candy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Brander,20.0,90.0,"The nose on this bottling from longtime Sauv Blanc proponent Fred Brander and winemaker Fabian Bravo is light and delicate, with dried apricot and wet hay aromas, but also tangy, with fresh-cut tangerines. The acidity is evened out on the sip, making for a subtle and pleasant experience full of dried grass, light citrus and Granny Smith apple skin flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Caliterra,20.0,90.0,"Dusty, sweet, dark-fruited and properly herbal, this is a Cabernet that very much fits the Chilean blueprint of what the variety should smell and taste like. Creamy and full, with bold berry, herb and vanilla flavors, and then with a lush, dense finish. Drink now through 2012."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Oliverhill,20.0,90.0,"This Shiraz does a nice job of balancing its fruit-sweet characters of blackberry and blueberry with savory elements of herbs and green olives. It's full-bodied, warm and creamy-textured, with a warm, chocolaty finish. Drink it now and over the next few years."
Jacquère,France,France Other,Les Rocailles,20.0,90.0,"This is ripe and full in the mouth, with fine acidity and rich white stone fruit. It's delicious and floral, balancing its crisp texture with generous fruitiness. Great as an apéritif or with food, it's a refreshing wine to drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Mouchão,20.0,90.0,"Produced at the iconic Mouchão estate, this wine comes from old vines of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet. It has all the richness that comes from fermentation in open stone lagars, giving density and juicy black fruits. Wood aged, the wine is spicy, jammy and fruity; ready to drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,20.0,90.0,"While dry in style, a hint of honey marks the nose of this zesty medium-bodied Riesling. Electric acidity lends a raciness to the palate, highlighting fresh, concentrated flavors of apple, pear and lemon. A kiss of blossom and crushed minerals dance on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Österreichischer Sekt,Szigeti,20.0,90.0,"Glimpses of golden ripe mirabelle plum and the slightest hint of lovage create a lovely nose and continue to feature on the creamy, finely foaming palate. The body is wonderfully light, framed by foamy autolysis and pervaded by citrus peel freshness. A totally individual but refreshing Austrian fizz."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,The Lucky Country,20.0,90.0,"Rich, full bodied and plush, with mochaccino-like fruit and plummy notes. This Shiraz is warm and inviting, picking up hints of vanilla and mint along the way. The velvety finish lingers."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes,20.0,90.0,"While this is pink fizz, its intent is serious and showcases the structure of Pinot Noir. The palate is dry and displays some pleasant bitterness around the edges, accentuating both dryness and austerity. This will work better at the table—say with salmon sashimi—rather than as an apéritif. This is a serious wine, so explore its hidden charms."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,20.0,90.0,"Structured and sophisticated, it offers creamy green apple, pear, citrus and white peach sensations. The juicy fruit palate is restrained by subtle notes of white pepper and mineral alongside fresh acidity that leaves a focused, lingering finish."
Palomino,Spain,Andalucia,González Byass,20.0,90.0,"Tilts towards sweet on the nose, where maple, molasses, pecan and baked fruit aromas hold court. The palate is layered and lively, with a nice blend of pit fruits, toast, nuts and butter. Long and elegant on the finish, it's highly drinkable and enjoyable within the oloroso class."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Henry Fessy,20.0,90.0,"A very structured wine, as befits this normally powerful cru. It is packed with dark tannins and minerality. The wine is angular, and you can taste the granite and schist soil. This edge of austerity is balanced by delicious fruit."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Mythology,20.0,90.0,"Barrel fermented, with deep fruit flavors of orange concentrate, Meyer lemon, candied pineapple and pear. A smorgasbord of fruit, nicely set against light caramel and toast from the barrels. Could not be more delicious, in a drink-now style."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Calavon,20.0,90.0,"Ripe and fruity, this is a concentrated rosé that shows its origins in the rich terroir of Aix-en-Provence. That said, all the right acidity and citrus flavors are there balancing the generous red plum fruits. This is a wine for food rather than an aperitif."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Monbadon,20.0,90.0,"Structured, concentrated wine, showing the firm texture of the vintage with firm tannins balancing intense acidity. The wine has power—witness the alcohol—but this is contained in a more elegant texture. Best to age this wine for 4–5 years."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Roubine,20.0,90.0,"Rich and complex, this is a densely flavored rosé. It has spice and tangerine orange zest as well as a more complex red pepper and red currant character. It is a wine for fish or ratatouille."
Viognier,US,California,Cedarville Vineyard,20.0,90.0,"A beautifully floral Viognier, its aromas tenderly inviting, with uplifting hints of apricot, pear and white fig. It's a deftly made white with lovely minerality and a fleshy mouthfeel all wrapped up in the end with a light touch of lemon."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Paul Dolan,20.0,90.0,"Paul Dolan is a go-to brand for moderately priced Cabernet. Aromas like fresh mint and rose petals meets full fruit and spice flavors in this dry, firmly structured and nicely balanced wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Plungerhead,20.0,90.0,"This impressive value-driven wine, with small amounts of Petit Verdot and Petite Sirah added, offers a pleasant array of lavender, smoke and chocolate tastes atop a thick texture. Tangy cranberry, raspberry and blackberry give it a juicy, fruity edge that's decadent yet integrated."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,20.0,90.0,"This ripe and full wine is balanced and textured. A mineral background gives a crisp character to the ripe yellow and pear fruit flavors. With long aging on lees, the wine has weight and richness. It should be aged further and drunk from 2016."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Castro Brey,20.0,90.0,"Classic Albariño aromas of sea brine, tropical fruits, lees and dust precede a minerally lemony palate with tangy flavors of lemon, lime and gooseberry. This is a fresh clean example with a long stony citrusy finish."
Viognier,US,California,Perry Creek,20.0,90.0,"Full bodied, buttery and spicy in aroma and oaky in flavor, this wine has a big, bold personality from the first whiff through the lingering finish. Complexity and body are its strong suits rather than fruitiness."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Swick,20.0,90.0,"All Pinot Noir, fermented in neutral oak and put through partial malolactic, this belongs in the rosé category. A pretty, pale-copper color, it offers a pleasing toasted-cracker frame around stone fruit and supple acids. Drink this chilled to white wine temperature."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Familia Cassone,20.0,90.0,"Almost everything about this wine is right on the money, from bouquet and flavors to feel and price. The nose is sweet and floral, with deep, alluring berry aromas. The palate offers a fine texture, with pure, layered blackberry, cola and spice flavors. Satisfying on the finish and complete."
Syrah,US,California,Klinker Brick,20.0,90.0,"Charred oak aromas and flavors are paramount in this assertive, bold and tannic wine. By themselves the smoky, peppery aspects would make for a one-dimensional wine, but this one adds substantive, rich, blackberry-like fruit flavors underneath. The firm tannins call for pairing with a rib-eye steak or barbecue."
Grenache Blanc,US,California,Klinker Brick,20.0,90.0,"Leafy, fresh herb aromas and tangy, reserved jicama and kiwi flavors make this dry, unoaked wine a delight to drink. It has vivid acidity, light body and a fresh, lingerirg finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Charles Cimicky,20.0,90.0,"A strong effort from Cimicky, the 2008 Trumps displays ample complexity in its hints of chocolate, coffee, cedar, blueberries and baking spices, then puts all of that in a soft, creamy, mouthfilling package tinged with licorice on the finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Leyda Valley,Undurraga,20.0,90.0,"One sniff receives immediate prickle and a hint of fresh bell pepper offset by citrus blossom and passion fruit. All the components of excellent Sauvignon Blanc appear in this carved, sizzling wine: tangerine, orange, grapefruit and lime flavors; freshness and physique; purity and sense of place."
Red Blend,Chile,Maipo Valley,Pargua,20.0,90.0,"Toasty and solid on the nose, with hints of mineral, dark spice, black olive and cassis. It's structured but a little rich and sticky, with sweet berry and cassis flavors along with brown sugar on the finish. A blend of six grapes that's easygoing and generous. Drink now through 2013."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Pratsch,20.0,90.0,"A full-bodied wine, layering delicious apricot and pear fruits with lemon zest and an apple skin texture. With a great bite of acidity, this is a ripe yet also mineral wine. Screwcap."
White Blend,Hungary,Tokaj,Holdvölgy,20.0,90.0,"A blend of 65% Furmint and 35% Hárslevelu, this Hungarian white has aromas of apricot, peach and pear. In the mouth, there are flavors of canned peaches, fresh white peach and pear with a crisp finish."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Anier,20.0,90.0,"Clean, green and not at all mean is how to best describe the aromas on this pure Verdejo. The mouthfeel is citric and crystalline. Flavors of citrus fruits, particularly lemon and lime, show a hint of matchstick sulfur, while the finish is the slightest bit nutty in flavor. Drink immediately."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Wines & Winemakers,20.0,90.0,"Produced from old vines, this crisp wine is floral and fresh. Concentrated with white and citrus fruit flavors over tight steeliness, it has a serious side of complex textures that will allow it to develop over the next few months. Drink now for the fresh fruit tones, although it will be better from late 2016."
Merlot,US,California,Frey,20.0,90.0,"This bold wine has a very dark color and fresh, concentrated blackberry aromas. Generous berry and black pepper flavors seem to saturate the taste buds, leading to a lingering fruit and spice finish. The texture is almost viscous, as lots of fine tannins add grip. It's the rare wine with no added sulfites."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Gilberto Boniperti,20.0,90.0,"Rose, strawberry and forest floor aromas meld in the glass on this charming expression of Nebbiolo. The bright, savory palate doles out crushed strawberry, black raspberry, clove and star anise alongside silky tannins. Like a little black dress, this would be perfect for any occasion."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Ricardo Santos,20.0,90.0,"This ripe Malbec offers jammy blueberry aromas that hint at raisin but pull back in the nick of time. A round pulpy palate is home to black cherry, berry and plum flavors supported by loamy earthy notes. A fleshy finish isn't exact but it's friendly. Drink through 2019."
Carmenère,Chile,Aconcagua Valley,Arboleda,20.0,90.0,"Coffee, mint and earthy blackberry aromas open this rich, ripe—almost unctuous—Carmenère. Spiced berry and lightly herbal black plum flavors finish full and balanced, while ending flavors of dark-roast coffee, chocolate and herbs are just right."
Malagouzia,Greece,Chalkidiki,Claudia Papayianni,20.0,90.0,"This refined Malagouzia starts with a fleshy peach and melon nose, followed by pronounced flavors of peach, citrus and spice on the palate. Balanced and pretty, the fruit tones linger on the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Joseph Carr,20.0,90.0,"This crisp and balanced wine offers lemon, guava and papaya, tropical without being cloying. With enough viscous creaminess to keep it medium in weight, it's soft and herbal, with measured acidity and a golden color. It finishes lean and savory."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Markus Molitor,20.0,90.0,"Slick, slightly glycerol streaks of white peach and grapefruit abound in this concentrated yet zesty Riesling. Semidry in style, it's buoyantly fruity and forward, with just a touch of pollen on the finish. Drink now."
Grüner Veltliner,US,Washington,W.T. Vintners,20.0,90.0,"This wine was 20% barrel fermented with the rest in stainless steel. The aromas bring appealing notes of green apple, white pepper and herb. The palate is dry and sleek but still rounded in feel. This is as impressive an example of the variety that has come out of the state to date. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,Anthony Nappa,20.0,90.0,"This barely-blush Pinot Noir vinified like a white wine (with no skin contact) is rapidly becoming a new Long Island classic. It's gorgeously aromatic, wafting of cherries and citrus blossom. The palate is brisk and zesty, yet mouth-filling, concentrated in crisp peach and red cherry flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Buena Vista,20.0,90.0,"Decadent swirls of petrol and oak inform the entry of this young wine, golden in color and viscous on the palate. Coconut flakes season a core of ripe pear compote and cinnamon before a streak of sizzling acidity tempers the richness of the wine's initial impression, ultimately finding freshness on the finish."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Mayer am Pfarrplatz,20.0,90.0,"A shy nose merely hints at peachy, gentle fruit. The palate, however, brims with zesty, lemony freshness, juicy peach and an earthy, textured tanginess. Slender, brisk and crisp, the wine is utterly refreshing."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Vila Nova,20.0,90.0,"An aromatic wine, full of ripe fruit and with great acidity to balance. It has a touch of spice, pear and crisp apple fruitiness. The texture and the tight minerality indicate the wine is still young. Drink from 2017."
Merlot,US,California,St. Francis,20.0,90.0,"A percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon is blended into this Merlot to give structure around its otherwise soft, round and lingering combination of dark candied plum, cinnamon and cedar. Medium-bodied and not overdone on the oak, the wine finishes with a touch of smoke."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Domdechant Werner,20.0,90.0,"While dry in style, this bold, intensely concentrated Riesling is rich in notes of sunny peach and honeysuckle. Luscious on the palate, it's cut by a bright line of tangerine acidity that lingers on the finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alamos,20.0,90.0,"This is Alamos's top Malbec, and it is fat and savory on the nose, with rubber, leather, asphalt and cured-meat aromas in addition to showing jammy fruit scents. In the mouth, this is lush and meaty, with blueberry, jerky and campfire flavors. A toasty, stout finish is big and weighty, but overall this fruit bomb is balanced."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Buondonno,20.0,90.0,"This savory selection offers earthy aromas of underbrush, truffle and leather. The zesty palate expresses tart red cherry flavor punctuated by mint, vanilla and espresso accents. It's nicely balanced, with firm but ripe tannins and ample freshness. Artisan Wines, Downey Selection."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Familia Villanueva,20.0,90.0,"Raisin, black plum and oregano are the aromas that define this lightly baked, earthy Malbec. In the mouth, this is direct and slightly raw in feel, but not overly so. Flavors of herbal fruits, raisin and stewed berries finish solid and with a peppery taste that introduces a mild burn to the picture. Drink through 2017."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,20.0,90.0,"This Pinot Grigio offers aromas of fragrant white flower and citrus zest. Its linear, elegant palate shows tangerine, pear, lemon drop and a hint of crystallized ginger alongside bright acidity."
Zinfandel,US,California,Four Vines,20.0,90.0,"This is tasty in a ripe, extravagantly fruity way. Raspberry and strawberry aromas seem as sweet as syrup. The full body and alcoholic strength give it a strong texture, but without too much tannic grip. Barbecued ribs or a cheese plate could be great matches."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Calavon,20.0,90.0,"This is rich with fruit as well as a mineral, tangy texture. A ripe character comes from the delicious raspberry fruit and acidity (60% Grenache, 40% Cinsault). The aftertaste is fresh, while remaining textured and ready for food."
Chardonnay,US,New York,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,20.0,90.0,"Richness and elegance go toe-to-toe in this creamy yet crisp, fruity Chardonnay. It's lavishly textured, enriched by streaks of butter and cream, yet pristine apple and pear flavors shine through brightly. The caramel-kissed finish lingers."
White Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta Le Calcinaie,20.0,90.0,"Structured and savory, this opens with heady aromas of yellow flower, nut and dried stone fruit. On the concentrated but poised palate, notes of nutmeg and ginger accent a core of mature peach, baked apple and juicy citrus. Bright acidity energizes the rich flavors."
Gewürztraminer,Canada,British Columbia,Township 7,20.0,90.0,"Although this wine is described as slightly off dry by the winery, for most palates it would be perfectly dry, though just slightly rounded off to eliminate any suggestion of sourness. Lychee, pineapple and grapefruit flavors abound, underscored with refreshing minerality. That vivid acidity carries through a resonant, lively finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Pedroncelli,20.0,90.0,Dark plum and cinnamon intermix on the nose and on the palate in this high-toned version of the variety from an appellation in which it grows well. Black licorice and mocha chocolate play off one another before a dusty finish.
Zinfandel,US,California,Andis,20.0,90.0,"Full of berry and spice aromas, this wine is full-bodied, dry, and grippingly tannic in texture, offering ripe blackberry and raspberry flavors that match its big structure. Gutsy and concentrated, it's made from estate-grown fruit."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Niepoort,20.0,90.0,"A new venture from Dirk Niepoort, who has chosen the crisp and fresh Loureiro grape as the base for this tantalizingly refreshing wine. It is dry, dancing lightly on the palate with a lively citrus and grapefruit character."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Veramonte,20.0,90.0,"Veramonte's first high-end Ritual Sauvignon is a big success. The nose is mellow, refined and minerally as opposed to pungent and feline. The feel is fresh, clean as a razor, and easygoing, with lime, nectarine and passion fruit flavors. Long and lightly green on the classy finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Mettler Family Vineyards,20.0,90.0,"The spicy, oaky aromas are obvious and fun, leading to fully ripe flavors like blackberry jam in this full-bodied, deeply colored and velvet-textured wine. It's big but smooth, and the oak influence is welcome, adding interest and complexity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mascota,20.0,90.0,"Cherry and cassis aromas are dark and clean, with more than adequate ripeness. This Cab feels a bit edgy and abrasive, but not scratchy. Oaky, resiny flavors of berry fruits and plum finish spicy, with crisp acidity and tannins that poke and prod. Drink through 2021."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Fougas,20.0,90.0,"A perfumed wine, dominated by Merlot. It shows plenty of the structure of 2010, a firm and solid wine, full of oak aging flavors at this young stage. It's going to be a rich and full wine layered with blackberry fruits as it develops over the next 4–5 years."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Joleté,20.0,90.0,"Here's a fine expression of this grape, which has become the signature white wine for the Willamette Valley. This marries New World ripeness to Euro styling. Plump apple and pear fruit carries highlights of bee pollen and honey, with excellent grip and length."
Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,Australia,Western Australia,Leeuwin Estate,20.0,90.0,"This is the best example of this wine I can remember, as it manages to toe the fine line between being boldly aromatic and going over the top. Nettles and grapefruit, hints of white currants and passion fruit, it has something to offer any Sauvignon Blanc lover, finishing long and fresh."
Red Blend,Chile,Maipo Valley,Viña el Principal,20.0,90.0,"Fleshy berry aromas are lush, inviting and surrounded by notes of shoe polish and violet petal. This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-led multigrape blend that's chunky on the palate. Bombastic plum, cherry and wild-berry flavors finish wide, with patented Chilean notes of olive and spicy oak. Drink through 2020."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Caliterra,20.0,90.0,"Cool aromas of cola and dark fruits come with bold spice accents. Ripe and creamy in feel, with wild berry and peppery flavors, this Carmenère from a cool vintage is on the money as it finishes with a strong oak base and related spice notes."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lumos,20.0,90.0,"Lush fruit flavors combine in a mellow mix of apple, pear and light citrus. It's a rich wine, creamy and fruit-driven, with substantial weight and length."
Chenin Blanc,Portugal,Portuguese Table Wine,Ribafreixo,20.0,90.0,"Winemaker Mario Pinheiro lived in South Africa and grew to appreciate Chenin Blanc. Returning to Portugal, he planted a vineyard. This wine is full of the most intense and beautiful fruit and acidity. It has a great tangy character that is balanced with apple and sweet pear fruits. The wine is ready to drink."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Sineann,20.0,90.0,"This is an intensely floral style of Gewürztraminer, with expressive and pronounced aromas of flower and soap. It lingers gracefully in the mouth, continuing along those lines with flavors to match, then finishes with a graham cracker surprise."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Martin Ray,20.0,90.0,"Lemon pith and honey-vanilla provide substance to a floral, light and lingering wine also accented in melon that's food-friendly and refreshing."
White Blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Mayer am Pfarrplatz,20.0,90.0,"Rich notes of ripe peach and plum hover over more homely, ripe apple fruit. This enticing nose announces yet another Viennese field blend of immense and immediate charm. The idea here is of an easy-drinking but never facile wine of total local character that expresses typicity, freshness and joy. The verve of fresh lemon zestiness carries from the first sip to the last crisp echo of aftertaste. This is lip smacking and moreish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Henri Bonnaud,20.0,90.0,"Organic grapes grown on limestone close to Mont Sainte-Victoire have produced a wine that is tight, mineral and ripe. The texture and the structure suggest a wine for food. Plenty of juicy red fruits in the background give weight and richness to the wine and to its peppery aftertaste."

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Cavalinho,20.0,90.0,"Named after the convent of Tomar, a home to the medieval Knights Templar (now a national monument), this is a ripe structured wine that benefits from the Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional in the blend. Full and rich and with the ability to age, the wine is serious and full of fruit. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Matetic,20.0,90.0,"Fresh citrus and green-apple aromas lead to a healthy palate with just enough bracing acidity. Flavors of tangerine, passion fruit and grapefruit are bold and typical of Casablanca SB, while this tastes of lime, green herbs and scallion on a fit finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,20.0,90.0,"This is a voluptuous style, fleshy and fulfilling in ripe pineapple and papaya, evocative of tropical shores. Bristling acidity complements the fruit, as a wave of creamy vanilla picks up steam on the lengthy finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Andeluna,20.0,90.0,"A power-packed blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot that offers mossy aromas, earth and lush black fruit scents. The palate is lively yet balanced, with saturated wild berry, toast, anise and pepper flavors. Dark, toasted and showing licorice on the finish. A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Jules Taylor,20.0,90.0,"A blend of fruit drawn from the Awatere and Brancott subregions, this is a lively, fresh example of Marlborough Pinot Noir. Judiciously applied notes of vanilla and cinnamon accent flavors of cherry and herb that finish long, while the medium- to full-bodied wine's tannins are ripe and impart a creamy texture. Drink now and over the next couple of years."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Navarro,20.0,90.0,"This is an aromatic, honeysuckle-tinged cool-climate white, with layers of honey and spice. Light in body and texture, this complex, Alsace-style effort is the perfect accompaniment to Thai, Indian, Korean barbecue or spicy Chinese food."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Vieux Robin,20.0,90.0,"A great mix of solid tannins and juicy fruit, this is a rich and structured wine, with the firm character of the year and deep blackberry flavor. It has weight and an edge of spice, finishing with acidity."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Muxagat,20.0,90.0,"Ripe lime aromas and a full richly fruity palate give a rounded character to this wine. Apricot juice and tangerine brighten up the palate, fitting well with the wood and fruit structure. Keep for another few months for the whole wine to fill out even more."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Opta,20.0,90.0,"This generous smooth wine is packed with ripe tannins and vibrant red fruits. There is the typical mineral texture of many Dão wines along with solid spice and dark chocolate flavors from wood aging. This is an impressive wine that deserves to age further, so drink from 2019."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Encostas de Estremoz,20.0,90.0,"A satisfying marriage between Chardonnay and Arinto has produced a rich wood-aged wine.

Carmenère,Chile,Aconcagua Costa,Errazuriz,20.0,90.0,"A dark, saturated color is telling, because this is full and smoky on the nose, with aromas of beef jerky, oak and green herbs. Much like it looks, this Carmenère feels full and saturated. Herbal berry and black plum flavors are peppery and lightly green, while notes of tobacco, coffee and carob comprise the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade das Servas,20.0,90.0,"Produced in Estremoz by the Serrano Mira family, this rich wine is dense with dark tannins and a powerful structure. This concentration is surrounded by bold ripe berry fruits and acidity that give the wine its richness aided by the wood aging. Drink this finely structured wine from late 2018."
Red Blend,Uruguay,Canelones,Pizzorno,20.0,90.0,"Earthy, dusty, slightly cheesy plum and cassis aromas come with a floral note. This Tannat-led blend feels plummy and healthy, with direct acidity. Blackberry, plum and fig flavors finish smooth and chocolaty, with residual berry fruit. Drink through 2019."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Cascina del Pozzo,20.0,90.0,"This elegant expression of Nebbiolo opens with aromas of dried rose, crushed violet, tilled earth, savory herb and a balsamic note.

Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Chronic Cellars,20.0,90.0,"The Beckett brothers show their blending skills in this crisp mix of 41% Grenache Blanc, 37% Viognier and 22% Picpoul, which shows apple blossoms, peach and wet stone on the nose.

Riesling,France,Alsace,Frédéric Mallo,20.0,90.0,"Notes of herb and stone color the subdued fruit of the nose on this wine. The medium-sweet palate reveals a more honeyed nature, hemmed in by a pithy, almost earthy bitterness of citrus peel, giving both balance and texture. The long finish is concentrated."
Syrah,US,California,Belharra,20.0,90.0,"While a minuscule amount of this was made, it bears remembering the producer for this is an impressive burst of tangy citrus, lemon and orange. Light and bright, it has a pithy texture of cranberry and raspberry."
Touriga Franca,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,20.0,90.0,The grape that is more commonly found in the Douro shows itself in a finely structured wine that has layers of wood as well as black fruits. A dark chocolate flavor stands out. Wait until 2018 to drink this dense and complex wine.
Chardonnay,US,California,Apriori,20.0,90.0,"A Chardonnay with an unusual companion, 8% Sémillon, this is floral and fruity in equal measure. Tight, bright acidity supports flavors of fennel and green apple, with the oak impact playing a subtle supporting role. The finish is nicely crisp."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Birichino,20.0,90.0,"Hailing from one of the more popular vineyards for this varietal in the whole Central Coast, this wine by Bonny Doon vets Alex Krause and John Locke offers aromas of apple cider, mandarin spritzer and lemon rinds. The palate boasts the flavors but not tartness of ruby red grapefruit along with a subtle apple mousse, and a tension that hovers on a chalky, slightly bitter minerality."

Cabernet Sauvignon,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,20.0,90.0,"A bouquet of black cherry, tart cranberry and clove opens into flavors of cherry, anisette, espresso bean and mint, with a hint of tart cranberry. The minty notes can almost seem overly strong for a moment, but tart tones bring the fruit flavors back to the foreground. The pleasantly gripping tannins will mellow with a few more years of aging."
Rosato,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tornatore,19.0,90.0,"Alluring scents of Spanish broom, iris, berry and a hint of dried herb come together on this. The bright palate offers candied cherry, nectarine zest, white pepper and a hint of fennel while a mineral note signals the finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Rutherford Ranch,19.0,90.0,"Creamy and well-integrated, this offers personality and style. The crisp bite of green apple and lemon curd are textured and long-lasting. With its overall balance, it is a fantastically versatile pairing option."
Red Blend,US,Washington,SuLei,19.0,90.0,"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age."
Red Blend,Italy,Central Italy,Cantina Fratelli Pardi,19.0,90.0,"Bright and silky, this blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot offers aromas of blue flower, spicy red berry and a hint of leather.

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Larrivaux,19.0,90.0,"From the northern end of the Haut-Médoc region, close to Saint-Estèphe, this dark-hued wine is still very structured. Smoky wood-aging flavors give complexity that balances the ripe black currant fruitiness. It's still developing, so don't drink before 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tour de Pez,19.0,90.0,"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estèphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one. New wood aging shows strongly at this stage, although so does the fruit. That gives a structured wine, firm and also full of blackberry fruit flavors. The future is good for this wine, so drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Lackner Tinnacher,19.0,90.0,"Mossy freshness and fragrance appear on the shy subdued nose. The wonderfully slender and sprightly palate is fresh and delicate. There is something subtle and lithe about this, which is very uplifting. The finish is refreshing and clean."

Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Pech Merle,19.0,90.0,"Made in a stainless-steel, grassy style, this features a charming balance of peach and apricot buzzing in the background to maintain the fruit amidst the natural acidity. Delightfully drinkable, it finishes lean and crisp."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Sokol Blosser,19.0,90.0,"From the warmest vintage on record, ripeness was never the issue here. It's balance and freshness that are the litmus test, and this passes with flying colors. Firm polished apple and pear fruit anchors the wine, with highlights of citrus skin. It's got all you could ask for in an all-purpose, solid and tasty young white wine."
Chenin Blanc,US,Washington,Kiona,19.0,90.0,"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish. Good acid balance. It's still very young, but immediately delicious."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Leyda Valley,San Pedro,19.0,90.0,"Over the past few years, San Pedro has consistently put out excellent SBs under its 1865 label. This sings of coastal Chilean Sauvignon via mineral, passion fruit and grapefruit aromas. In the mouth, it's chiseled like a statue, with a mix of citrus and green flavors. Expect a cutting, crisp, zesty finish."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Terenzi,19.0,90.0,"Rich in wild cherry, raspberry, black cherry and white pepper, this delicious wine offers all the juicy fruit, freshness, minerality and supple tannins that make a young, well-made Morellino so attractive. Extremely enjoyable now, it will maintain beautifully until 2017–2018 and develop more depth."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Abbazia di Novacella,19.0,90.0,"Structured and elegant, this lovely Pinot Grigio opens with delicate scents of white Alpine flower, citrus and a whiff of herb. The bright palate offers creamy white peach, crisp green apple and juicy nectarine while a mineral note backs up the finish. Bright acidity provides lift and balance."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Brigue,19.0,90.0,"Almost white in color, this wine takes the Provence fashion for light rosé to extremes. To taste, yes, it is a rosé with a light tannic edge and red-currant flavors. The aftertaste with lime and lemon freshness is bright, emphasizing the clean fruitiness of the wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Oak Farm,19.0,90.0,"Fresh and light in aroma, crisp and delicate in flavor, this wine is light-bodied, well-balanced and attractively restrained in character. Because of all that it will be extremely versatile with food—everything from shucked oysters to Thai food to smoked salmon."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Ottella,19.0,90.0,"Aromas of white flower, tropical fruit and peach mingle in the glass. The round, juicy palate offers stone fruit, green apple and mineral alongside bright acidity. The lingering finish has a note of ginger drop."
Chardonnay,Australia,Victoria,Nugan Family Estates,19.0,90.0,"Lush and mouthfilling, this tropical-fruited Chard offers a ton of flavors at a surprisingly small price. Smoky toasted-almond notes accent star fruit and guava flavors. Drink now–2011."
Edelzwicker,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,19.0,90.0,"A lovely ethereal lift of lemon balm hovers over ripe peach notes on the nose. The dry palate brings in lots of lemon freshness as well as tangy grapefruit. The finish is spicy, clean and utterly refreshing."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Wrath,19.0,90.0,"The family-owned, Santa Lucia Highlands-focused Wrath Winery produces their Ex Anima line to show off wines from their estate San Saba Vineyard made with very little intervention and no new oak. This wine is nearly as clear as water, and yet offers aromas or freshly cut grass, honeydew melon, kiwi and fresh rain on rocks. On the palate, minerality lingers alongside poached pear and peach. Refreshing and light, yet full of flavor."
G-S-M,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,19.0,90.0,"Despite a reported alcohol level that's moderate for its genre, this feels nicely full and rounded on the palate. Hints of vanilla and sarsaparilla accent flavors of cherries, plums and chocolate, while the tannins are supple and creamy in texture. Drink now–2018."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schumann-Nägler,19.0,90.0,"Impressive for its minerality, this wine offers up aromas of petrol, honey and slate rather than the fruit-driven notes of many Rieslings. In the mouth, it's like drinking liquid rocks with just enough honey to help the minerals slide down smoothly, lingering sweetly on the finish."
White Blend,Spain,Galicia,Viña Mein,19.0,90.0,"A barrel-aged surprise. The nose is round and toasty but not overwooded. The palate is balanced and elegant, with full, round, integrated flavors of dry apple, cream and spice. Has the right texture to be considered elevated and classy; 70% Treixadura with five other white grapes."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,Weingut Weber,19.0,90.0,"This bang-for-your-buck spätlese shows off the surprisingly tropical side of Nahe, one of Germany's sunniest wine regions. Ripe, rich mango and pineapple flavors are soothing and mouthcoating, brightened by squirts of sunny grapefruit and tangerine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Casca Wines,19.0,90.0,"Firm and structured, this has dense tannins as well as fruity character. Both the texture and the black plum fruits are concentrated. Flavors of wood aging have smoothed out the naturally stalky character of the fruit. Drink from 2016."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Haut-Monplaisir,19.0,90.0,"Ripe, almost sweet, fruit is full of delicious black plum and berry flavors. The wine is rounded, opulent and generous to a fault. A solid core of darker tannins hold all this richness together. Drink from 2015."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de la Jaubertie,19.0,90.0,"This wood-aged wine shows equal notes of toasty spice and ripe fruit. On the palate, it's full and round, with pear and apricot flavors giving it richness. This is concentrated and worth aging for another 2–3 years."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes,19.0,90.0,"Now perfectly ready to drink, this wine from vines close to Pouilly-Fuissé is ripe with yellow fruit, juicy acidity and a smooth texture. It has plenty of minerality to keep it bright and lively. Drink now."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes,19.0,90.0,"This single-vineyard wine is rich and crisply fruity. It has the bright, tight texture of the vintage, giving a tense character while retaining the lush, poised fruit of the vintage. It's delicious now and ready to drink."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,90.0,"This lovely wine shows perfect physiological ripeness, with high acidity intact. Melon and white peach fruit flavors anchor a snappy, fresh, all-stainless style."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rosenblum,19.0,90.0,"Old vine clone, with brambly, gamy notes throughout. Lifts up the palate with lively, bright flavors. Good concentration, balance and follow-through."
Zweigelt,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,19.0,90.0,"A restrained nose leads to a cherry-fruited, sprightly, light palate. Ample freshness and peppery spice give this ease and poise, with fragrant forest fruit and cherry notes. A lovely summer red that can even be served slightly chilled."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Solabal,19.0,90.0,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011."
Pinot Gris,New Zealand,Marlborough,Lawson's Dry Hills,19.0,90.0,"With only 6.5 g/l of residual sugar, this weighty wine comes across as almost dry, allowing the emphasis to be on the bold notes of melon, pear and citrus. It's rich without being overtly sweet, then finishes clean, adding a touch of white pepper to the mix. Drink now–2012."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Pral,19.0,90.0,"A finely structured wine, very firm, with a dark edge of tannins over ripe black fruit. The wine is concentrated and dense, still developing and showing great final juicy character."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Vinha Paz,19.0,90.0,"The structure is the thing here, a square, firmly tannic wine. The dry core of this impressive wine spreads out to the dark plum skin and loganberry flavors, solid and finely angled."
Zinfandel,US,California,Bodkin,19.0,90.0,"Dry and delicious, this lightly colored rosé opens with a compelling waft of rose water and exudes copper-pink color. A refreshingly searing acidity maintains vibrancy from start to finish, accented in grapefruit. This quaff is great on its own or throughout a meal."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejo,Roquevale,19.0,90.0,"This barrel fermented wine is full-bodied and rich with ripe yellow fruit and spicy toast notes. The wine has a fine tangy edge that gives it a real lift and contrasts with the dense, vanilla and fruit finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Nautilus,19.0,90.0,"At this early stage of the wine's evolution, it shows some slightly pungent, sweaty notes, but they're balanced by ample ripe passion fruit aromas and flavors. It's medium in weight, with an attractively structured mouthfeel, and a bright, lengthy finish that echoes with grapefruit."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Prieler,19.0,90.0,The pure and evocative scent of wild huckleberries leads onto a concentrated but still medium palate that is light and sprightly on its feet—a reflection of the 2014 vintage. There is freshness but also some silky grip. The aftertaste presents a lovely dollop of white pepper.
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Scharffenberger,19.0,90.0,"A delicious Chardonnay and Pinot Noir blend from coolly grown Mendocino grapes that is equal parts golden apple and honey in both aroma and flavor. Creamy from full malolactic fermentation, this sparkler is full-bodied and plenty fruity with a caramel, vanilla tone on the finish. Will pair well with creamy, full-bodied foods."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Forstreiter,19.0,90.0,"Deliciously fresh and fruity, this is a wine full of ripe apples and crisp pears. It's full bodied, but bright with intense acidity. The characteristic pepper touch of Grüner shows at the end of this full and concentrated wine. Screwcap."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Maquis,19.0,90.0,"Ripe black-fruit aromas get a boost from dark spice notes. Saturated, heavy and deep in the mouth, this is a meaty wine with blackberry flavors leading herb and leathery notes. On the finish, this remains dark and driven by black fruits and firm tannins. Drink through 2018."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Adelsheim,19.0,90.0,"Quite tart when it hits the lips, this is nonetheless a dense, flavorful Pinot Gris, tasting of grapefruit, sour orange, apple and green banana. It shows lots of juice and powers through the mid-palate into a fruit-driven finish."
Pinot Noir,Austria,Burgenland,Meinklang,19.0,90.0,"Red cherry and wild strawberry suggest themselves aromatically. The light body is fresh and equally aromatic, slender, lithe and elegant. This is a very continental, balanced and rounded Pinot Noir, all the more charming for its unfussy, fresh-faced authenticity."
Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodegas Caro,19.0,90.0,"Amancaya, a blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, never fails to impress. This wine is rich and controlled but also alert and upright. It is juicy and succulent, with ripe blackberry and cassis at its base. Finishes tight and long, and sports a fine structure throughout."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Dopff & Irion,19.0,90.0,"Pale pink in the glass, this has a rather fragrant nose that combines strawberry and citrus. The palate is ultralight and very fizzy, exuberant and fresh while remaining dry and full-flavored. Yeasty autolysis provides backbone and structure, while the creamy citrus elements make for complete refreshment."
Müller-Thurgau,Germany,Rheinhessen,Fritz Müller,19.0,90.0,"Delightfully fun and refreshing, this perlwein, or lightly sparkling white, is Germany's answer to Italian prosecco. Made from Müller-Thurgau grapes, it's gorgeously floral, but with a chalky, earthen tang. Sprightly acidity and a fresh, green touch lends vibrance to a moderately long finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Byron,19.0,90.0,"It's hard to find a tastier Pinot Noir for this price. Aromas of rose petals, pungent violets and raspberry juice show just a touch of chai tea, and the palate proves juicy and fun, with cranberry, pomegranate and raspberry elements. Black tea and mocha flavors add just enough seriousness."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Casca Wines,19.0,90.0,"The high percentage of Touriga Franca in this wine has given it structure as well as red berry fruitiness. It is generous, but supported by a dry core of tannins. Twelve months in wood have smoothed out the fruit stalkiness and given a ripe wine that could age further. Drink from 2016."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Esporão,19.0,90.0,"Just as the wine's label suggests, this is a wine born under the sun. It is full and rich in superripe fruit tempered by ample acidity. Wood aging gives spice and a slightly burnt character that needs more time to fully integrate. The finish remains ripe, spicy and full of great acidity; hold until 2016."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fleur,19.0,90.0,"This wine has a high-toned richness that presents as clean and linear. Briny olive notes define the opening aroma, while more developed pear, apple and peach flavors fill out the palate."
Mourvèdre,US,California,Le P'tit Paysan,19.0,90.0,"Venturing into the orange side of the rosé color rainbow, this Mourvèdre-based wine—with 13% Grenache—brings melon, guava, pomelo and ripening banana to the nose, followed by papaya and watermelon once sipped. It's a revealing look at the potential of the overlooked Central Coast vineyards that winemaker Ian Brand diligently seeks out, both for his personal labels and the many for which he consults."
Grenache,US,California,Midsummer Cellars,19.0,90.0,"Made from 88% Grenache and 12% Viognier, this lilting wine abounds with dry, fruity and floral characteristics. Salmon-peach in color, it has texture and the requisite refreshment offered by its barely ripe strawberry and peach swathes. Although it delivers enough acidity and bite to pair with food, it might be hard to wait that long."
Rosé,US,New York,Paumanok,19.0,90.0,"Exuberant raspberry and cherry notes scent this dusty pink rosé. While brisk and dry on the palate, it's juicy and mouth-quenching with ripe white peach and red berry flavors. It finishes minerally with lingering salinity."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Lisboa,Adega Mãe,19.0,90.0,"An impressive and concentrated wine that brings out tannins as well as the fine perfumes that lie at the heart of a Touriga Nacional. It is certainly dense with blackberry and black plum fruits giving a juicy side to the young tannins. As it develops, the wine will show elegance while remaining super-rich and opulent. Drink from 2018."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Salentein,19.0,90.0,"Earthy black-fruit and spice aromas are clean and welcoming, while this is potent and full of life on the palate. Black cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors are intense and finish with a notable amount of minty menthol character. Drink through 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Tement,19.0,90.0,"A touch of flinty smoke hovers above the glass and clouds other varietal aromas of citrus and fern that find ready expression on the dry, fresh palate. The slender body still has some smoky edges, defined freshness and a clean-cut finish."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,90.0,"A quick impression of vitamin pill gives way to highlights of lemon oil and caramel apples. The flavors continue in a fruit-forward vein, with a mix of ripe peaches and cantaloupe. This is a wine to enjoy while in the first blush of its youth."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Granbazán,19.0,90.0,"Aromas of fresh citrus fruits, crushed vitamins and nectarine are pleasant and welcoming. This offers good acidic cut and overall balance. Flavors of stone fruits focus on apricot and nectarine, while the finish is elegant."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Lemelson,19.0,90.0,"This wine has just enough residual sugar to take it to the upper threshhold of dry. It's quite full flavored with a thirst quenching mix of citrus, apple and pineapple. Crisp acidity enhances the freshness and contributes a tangy, lemony kick to the finish."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Clos de los Siete,19.0,90.0,"Clos de los Siete is a perennial leader among under-$20 wines from Argentina. Blueberry and graham cracker aromas are ripe and a touch reduced. The palate is saturated yet juicy, while blackberry, boysenberry, cardamom and nutmeg flavors feed into a dark tasting, compact finish. For a 50,000-case wine, this is a prize to behold."
Kerner,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Castelfeder,19.0,90.0,"Intense but refined flavors include exotic fruit, juicy white peach, Bartlett pear and citrus accented with nutmeg and mineral notes. It's balanced with crisp acidity that generates a clean, refreshing finish."
White Blend,US,California,Borra,19.0,90.0,"Winemaker Markus Niggli is making remarkable whites from unusual, hard-to-find grapes, in this case a blend of 50% Kerner, 25% Riesling and 25% Bacchus. This slight, seductive white dances in acidity that's got an electric mouthfeel, with a bouquet of citrus and herbs that you'll be thinking about a long time."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Pike Road,19.0,90.0,This new sister label from Elk Cove offers 100% Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at an everyday price. Fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by herb-tinged tannins. The immaculate craftsmanship and clean direct flavors are light years beyond budget Pinot Noir from most other regions. This is your perfect salmon wine.
Pinot Gris,US,Washington,Convergence Zone,19.0,90.0,"Certainly among the most unusual wines from this vineyard, here is a Pinot Gris with 30 g/L residual sugar and alcohol under 11%. There is sufficient acidity—along with the minerality that the vineyard is known for—to keep the flavors of citrus rind and flesh well rounded and buoyant. Sweet enough to pair with a fruity dessert."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Antichi Vigneti di Cantalupo,19.0,90.0,"This polished Nebbiolo opens with aromas of perfumed berry, violet, tilled soil and grilled herb. The bright, elegant palate doles out sour cherry, star anise and cinnamon framed in sleek tannins and bright acidity. A mineral note energizes the finish. Drink through 2018."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Oregon,Quady North,19.0,90.0,"Don't be fooled by the low alcohol, this little Pistoleta packs a high caliber punch. It's a full throttle blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc, bursting with ripe flavors of apples, peaches and pears. It's nicely rounded out with a finishing flavor of butter cookie."
Pinotage,South Africa,Robertson,Robertson Winery,19.0,90.0,"Brambly berries, plum and sweet-spice aromas lead on the bouquet of this wine, with secondary hints of tree bark and licorice root. The palate turns to dark fruit notes of black cherry and boysenberry, accented by glimmers of sweet smoke and cocoa. Creamy and lush in the mouth with a texture like crushed velvet and an enduring finish. Drink now–2015."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade dos Machados,19.0,90.0,"This big wine, now almost mature, shows dark plum and dense fruits that are pushed into shape by the firm tannins and wood aging flavors. The wine is dense and concentrated, with a fine juicy aftertaste that also promises further aging. Drink until 2020."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Morgadío,19.0,90.0,"Lightly briny aromas of sea foam blend nicely with crisp apple and mineral scents. This is focused on the palate, with a core of acidity and minerality that are the wine's foundation. Apple, orange, mango and melon flavors end clean and minerally."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Perdriel,19.0,90.0,"Dig into this if you like superripe, rich Malbec. This is loaded with graphite, smoky oak, blackberry and baking spice aromas. Expect maximum ripeness across the palate, meaning bearish flavors of berry fruits, wood and toast. There's not a lot of distance or complexity to the finish, but getting that far is half the fun."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,E. Guigal,19.0,90.0,"A perennial favorite, it's reassuring to see that the quality continues to remain high even from Guigal's least expensive cuvée. Red fruits—cherries and raspberries—marry easily with hints of clove, cracked pepper, black olive and espresso. It's round on the midpalate, showing more focus and ample length on the finish."
Red Blend,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,Santa Ema,19.0,90.0,"A zesty wine with more zap and tang than one might expect. That said, it's solid as a rock, with intense flavors of cherry, plum, carob and oak. Call it a bit obtuse, if you will. But even with woody finishing notes of vanilla and cream, this settles on fruit more so than the barrel. Carmenère (78%) with Syrah and Carignan."
White Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Gunter Triebaumer,19.0,90.0,"Fragrant notes of candied pear and lifted hints of orange blossom are tempered by exuberant lemon freshness. The palate is of tender, enveloping but not overbearing sweetness, carrying aloft an exquisite, honeyed tableau of pear and quince, mirabelle plum and apricot, balanced by pure lemon freshness. The finish is soft, moreish and mellow."
Gros Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine du Tariquet,19.0,90.0,"Just off dry, this is a delicious, honeyed wine. Made to drink as an apéritif or with a paté, it is soft and stylish. Aromatic apricot and baked apple flavors give this wine fruitiness while the background is full of bright acidity. Drink now."
Greco,Italy,Southern Italy,Villa Raiano,19.0,90.0,"Lightly scented, this opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, citrus and a whiff of aromatic herb. The bright, medium-bodied palate offers creamy peach, mature green apple and a hint of nectarine while a mineral note fills in the juicy finish."
Chenin Blanc,Canada,British Columbia,Quails' Gate,19.0,90.0,"Tart and lively, this lip-licking Chenin includes 9% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. Strong citrus flavors—lemon and grapefruit—along with pineapple, provide the concentrated core. A perfect oyster wine, with sap, snap and tang."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Chateau de l'Oiselinière,19.0,90.0,"Lightly wood-aged, this is a smooth and ripe wine. A touch of toast rounds out the fresh fruit flavor of juicy Golden Delicious apple. The wine is dry, crisp and fruity at the end, with bright acidity."
Riesling,US,New York,Domaine LeSeurre,19.0,90.0,"Lemon-drop candy and white blossoms perfume this impeccably balanced Riesling from French transplants Céline and Sébastien Leseurre. It's dry in style, but white grapefruit and lemon flavors are persistent and deep. Delicately textured and vivaciously fresh in acidity, the finish is brisk and pristine."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Adelsheim,19.0,90.0,"The fruit shines here—pears and apples aplenty—with textural notes of citrus rind. Balanced, with medium length, it's a young, clean, lip-smacking style, with more density than most Oregon Pinot Gris."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Angel Vine,19.0,90.0,"The entry-level Zin from Angel Vine combines fruit from the three single vineyard cuvées, along with a splash of Petite Sirah. Rich, plush berry scents and grapey berry fruit flavors abound—boysenberry, blackberry and more, buoyed with natural acidity. There is no sense that the alcohol is intrusive, and the wine fades gently with hints of red licorice and cocoa."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram-Donauland,Anton Bauer,19.0,90.0,"Juicy yellow pear and a touch of flint play on the mellow, textured body. Ripe apricot and pastry also show through, bringing a balance between zestiness and round flavors."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Other,Verum,19.0,90.0,"Floral berry, olive and spice aromas make for a rustic nose with polish. This wine feels lively and a bit jumpy, with woody plum and berry flavors that are braced and framed by crisp Patagonian acidity. A lightly herbal, salty finish is powerful but steady. Drink through 2020."
Riesling,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Esk Valley,19.0,90.0,"Austere and minerally, not exactly what you'd expect from a ""warm"" part of New Zealand. Some green apple and lime aromas lead into a refreshing palate laden with Green Gage plums. It's lean and wiry, a firmly structured wine that finishes long and minerally."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Nora,19.0,90.0,"This is a faultless Albariño that checks out up front, on the palate and late in the game. Tropical aromas are melony, fresh and minerally. The mouth is peachy and smooth in texture, with kicking acidity. Pithy citrus and nectarine flavors are textbook, and the citrusy finish is long and true."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Tinhof,19.0,90.0,"This is a spicy, exotic wine with flavors of rich berry fruits and a warm, perfumed structure. There are dense tannins supporting the ripe fruitiness and dark, brooding edge of this still-young wine. It can be drunk now for its fruit, but will also age remarkably well. Drink until 2019."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Awatere Valley,The Crossings,19.0,90.0,"This label has had its ups and downs over the years. The 2010 Pinot Noir is one of the successes, and it boasts an effusive nose of roses, cherries, dusty earth and mocha. It's medium to full in the mouth, delivering cherry fruit and underpinnings of earth and spice. The finish is long, spicy and firm without being hard."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,19.0,90.0,"An open and inviting scent of ripe pear is freshened by an impression of wet pebbles, cold stone and citrus. The palate is textured and expressive, giving a broader canvas to these fruity, fresh flavors that have a lovely edge of gentle bitterness. The palate finishes just off dry."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Dunham,19.0,90.0,"This wine brings immediate appeal, with notes of blueberry, vanilla and baking spices. The palate is sweet and supple, with plentiful blue-fruit flavors that linger."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Lucien Albrecht,19.0,90.0,"Slightly bruised apple on nose and palate also becomes apparent on the textured, balanced palate of this wine that aligns citric freshness with more mellow and sonorous tones of ripeness. The finish is dry and whistle-clean."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Martinsancho,19.0,90.0,"This Verdejo smells like citrus fruits and wild field grass, with a hint of feline aroma. Crisp and fresh, it offers flavors of melon, nectarine and nettle. A long, slightly salty finish is braced by bright acidity. Drink right away, if possible."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château le Pey,19.0,90.0,"This estate, belonging to the Compagnet family, is in the northern Médoc. Some firm tannins are contrasted with the attractive acidity and berry fruits to create a warm spicy wine. Almost equal amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot give a balanced wine. Drink from 2018."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Casa Gran del Siurana,19.0,90.0,"Rubbery, leathery aromas of minerally berry and raisin set up a tight, well-structured palate with bracing tannins. Fully ripe flavors of dark fruits and minerals finish warm and a bit baked, with a firm, proper feel. Drink through 2019."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,E. Guigal,19.0,90.0,"Guigal's Côtes du Rhône rosé is a blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Cinsault and 10% Syrah. It's a dark pink shade, rather full bodied and rich. Some earthy, savory notes help balance out the intense cherry-berry fruit, lingering on the finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Felsner,19.0,90.0,"Grapefruit peel, salty miso and white pepper create a savory and appetizing nose. The palate is slender and zippy, full of these spicy notes and enlivened by fresh lemon and green pear. It's a wonderfully easy but exciting Grüner: light but authentic, with lasting pepperiness."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Henry Fessy,19.0,90.0,"Properly structured, this is a solid wine. Great swathes of plum fruits are partnered with firm tannins. It is dark and firm, with a dense character. Touches of chocolate and roasted coffee go with the rich plums. Drink from 2015."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Sauvignon Republic,19.0,90.0,"Like many top Marlborough Sauvignons, this wine has a leafy, herbal component backed by copious fruit. In this case, the wine delivers touches of nectarine and pineapple, along with a bit of chili pepper. It's medium-bodied, with a long, mouth-watering finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,19.0,90.0,"Riper suspicions of yellow plum insinuate themselves on the nose. The palate is shot through with lemony freshness that brightens everything. Taut and fresh, this also has Alsace's more rounded edges. With time, more aromas arise, finishing in a fruity mix of apple, stone fruit and citrus."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carol Shelton,19.0,90.0,"This serious and concentrated wine has plenty of ripe fruit aromas and flavors, with a smooth texture, and lingering fruitiness on the finish. It resembles black plums and cloves in flavor, and has excellent balance and depth."
Godello,Spain,Galicia,Terra do Castelo,19.0,90.0,"This Godello is light, fruity and offers nice lime and apple aromas. It's linear, minerally and has a true slate feel, then stony flavors of tangerine and ripe peach take over. A juicy, pure finish tops it off."
White Blend,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Fleur Du Cap,19.0,90.0,"This starts off sweet and unctuous, with scents of superripe nectarine and apricot that flood the bouquet, followed by hints of baking spice, lightly toasted nuts and honey. The full, round texture is balanced by refreshing acidity that carries through to the long, bright finish. Drink now–2016."
Riesling,US,Washington,Milbrandt,19.0,90.0,"This wine is immediately appealing with vibrant aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle, white peach and wet stone. It drinks off dry, with a fleshy feel and drawn-out fruit flavors that linger."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,California,Midsummer Cellars,19.0,90.0,"A field blend of Grenache Blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier, this delightfully floral wine exudes spring flowers and fresh, just-ripe peach. The wine is dry, although the finish has a subtle suggestion of honey. A delicious wine for spring and summer sipping."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Quinta de Santiago,19.0,90.0,"An elegant Alvarinho from the north of the Vinho Verde region. It has some wood aging, rounding out the acidity of the fruit and introducing a spiced orange and lime character, full-bodied and ripe. It could age until 2015, but is ready to drink."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Tenuta Roveglia,19.0,90.0,"Juicy flavors of white peach, green apple, pear and exotic fruit team with hints of mineral and white almond. The creamy palate is energized by crisp, quenching acidity that leaves a clean finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Salida,19.0,90.0,"This is half Tempranillo, one quarter Garnacha, one quarter Monastrell.

The fruit is plump and dotted with dried herb, dusted with powdered sugar, open and expansive."
Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Flichman,19.0,90.0,"Dark in the glass, this has a moderately complex nose, with notes of black fruit, leather and spice. It feels tight, fresh and snappy, but not excessively wide or structured. Flavors of ripe berry and cocoa lead to a solid finish, which has a controlled, smooth feel. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot."
Zinfandel,US,California,Graziano,19.0,90.0,"Somehow this wine is bold, full bodied and superripe—yet balanced, sleek and structured. Tart, vibrant fruit aromas like raspberry and cranberry are followed by rich, almost sweet strawberry and red cherry flavors. A layer of fine tannins adds grip to the mouthfeel, and firm acidity keeps everything from being heavy."
Syrah,Chile,Colchagua Valley,MontGras,19.0,90.0,"Light plum and cherry aromas come with herbal notes and a touch of fir frond. Wide in feel, this Syrah tastes ripe and loamy, with jammy, lightly spiced plum and berry flavors. A warm, well-oaked finish is nice and bright. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Bodkin,19.0,90.0,"An unusually bright-gold color and aromas like vanilla and nutmeg signal a complex style for this unusually textured and nicely viscous wine that is technically light bodied in terms of alcohol. Balanced out by good acidity, it is not overtly fruity but goes for complexity and spiciness that linger on the finish."
White Blend,US,California,Markus Wine Co,19.0,90.0,"Assertive and delicious, this light-bodied and dry wine has dramatic aromas of wood smoke, wet stones and even diesel.

Zinfandel,US,California,Pear Valley,19.0,90.0,"Rather elegant and well integrated aromas of stewed black cherries, clove, gingerbread and vanilla are reminiscent of a rich dessert.

Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Ardenvoir,19.0,90.0,"This captures the essential flavors of Washington Sauvignon Blanc. There are no aggressive grassy-herbal flavors, none of the vegetal or canned pea flavors that show up in other New World Sauv Blancs. Here it's all about clean melon and yellow fruit flavors, backed with bracing natural acids, round and ripe."
Rolle,France,Provence,Domaine du Grand Cros,19.0,90.0,"The Rolle, or Vermentino, has produced a warm, herbal, southern sun-touched wine. It is full of rich yellow fruits and laced with acidity. A light touch of honey from the ripe fruits gives a deliciously smooth aftertaste. Drink now."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Chehalem,19.0,90.0,"This unoaked, tank-fermented, no-malolactic style delivers flavors as crisp and refreshing as a clear mountain stream. Steely and mineral-driven, its apple and pear flavors carry just a tongue-tickling hint of butter."

The utterly dry finish is full of glorious baked-apple notes."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Morgadío,19.0,90.0,"Peach aromas include a note of stone-fruit pit, while citrus is the other standout scent on an elegant nose. This wine is citrusy in feel, with good body and clarity. Flavors of orange and ripe grapefruit finish in fresh, clean fashion."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Gerd Anselmann,19.0,90.0,"Sharp acidity offsets juicy white peach and apricot flavors in this neatly balanced wine. It's dry in style, with a rich, rounded mouthfeel, but the finish is pristine and fresh. Enjoy now through 2022."

Muscat Canelli,US,California,Bodkin,19.0,90.0,"This delicious spicy white has an almost Latin flair. It smells like mango and cilantro, tastes crisp and peachy, and finishes with a sensation of mild chili peppers. It's fun to encounter something so arresting and unusual to drink."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello d'Albola,19.0,90.0,"Enticing aromas of violet, iris, wild berry, forest floor and cooking spice lead the nose of this savory blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo.

Syrah,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,CJ Pask,19.0,90.0,"Syrah is quickly gaining popularity in Hawke's Bay and this is a good example why.

Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Beronia,19.0,90.0,"Aromas of leather, smoked meats, charred oak and lacquer are not for the weak, while the mouthfeel is firm, deep and just right.

Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Il Poggione,19.0,90.0,"Year in and year out this estate leads the way with so-called Baby Brunello. And this version may be one of the best yet.

Chardonnay,Chile,Curicó Valley,Miguel Torres,19.0,90.0,"Makes a strong statement for the potential of Chardonnay in Chile, with powerful toast and hazelnut aromas playing opposite fruit comprised of peaches and Granny Smith apples. It's barrel-fermented and aged, but stayed only a relatively short time in wood, so you can still taste the fruit and all of the nutty, leesy complexities. Editors' Choice."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Jardin,19.0,90.0,"This is a lifted and fresh Chardonnay with vibrant notes of red apple flesh, hard Anjou pear and fresh orange essence.

White Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Tinhof,19.0,90.0,"White summer blossom and fresh green pear create a superlight, superfresh opening. The palate continues in the same vein: ultralight as befits the 2014 vintage, but with an aromatic, spicy, peppery edge. It makes for a perfect, light summer apéritif."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Matetic,19.0,90.0,"Briny citrus and green-fruit aromas reflect cold-climate origins. This is zesty yet round, with acidic grit and bite. Green pepper, jalapeño and green melon flavors finish spicy and tangy, like bitter lettuce mixed with passion fruit and tangerine."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Trenel Fils,19.0,90.0,"Ripe and floral in character, this rich wine is full and fruity, with a good structure of tannins that brings out spiciness. With acidity and a generous texture, the wine could age for another six months, so drink from spring 2016."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,California,Kuyam,19.0,90.0,"Sour fruits, tobacco pipe resin and toasted coconut combine for a funky but pleasing nose on this blend from Core Wine Co. The flavors are leathery with plum jam, and vibrant acidity runs from front to back."

Muscat,France,Rhône Valley,Vignobles La Coterie,19.0,90.0,"For a wine without a reputation for aging, this is surprisingly good. It's very lush and honeyed, with a viscous texture and a long, sweet finish. Try it with desserts rather than as an apéritif."
Chardonnay,Austria,Burgenland,Hannes Reeh,19.0,90.0,"The faintest touch of vanilla and cream barely manages to contain the fragrance of white summer blossom. The palate offers a return to classically restrained, creamy but well-integrated oaked Chardonnay with light-footed balance."
Garnacha,Spain,Levante,Casa Castillo,19.0,90.0,"Early aromas of latex and animal hide yield to earthy berry scents. A lively palate is full of energy, while blackberry, baked plum and chocolate flavors are more dense and generous than streamlined. Flavors of fudge, fig and berry fruits are bold on the finish.

Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Leon Beyer,19.0,90.0,"Summer fruit and fresh ripeness dominate: think red apple, yellow plum and breezy lemon freshness. This wine is really uplifting, light, fresh and friendly: it paints a picture of summer aperos under open skies. Drink soon."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Hubert Meyer,19.0,90.0,Beeswax and ripe pear appear with a subtle lift on the nose. There are evolved notes of earth and polished wood that dance above the ever-present softly sweet pear fruit. This is a slender wine rounded out with fruit that echoes softly. The finish is dry.
Grenache-Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Jean-Luc Colombo,19.0,90.0,"A strong effort from Jean-Luc and his team, the 2014 Les Forots is a nearly 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah. It offers layers of ripe fruit, ample weight and a supple mouthfeel, with just hints of garrigue for complexity and interest. Drink now–2022."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Granbazán,19.0,90.0,"Melon, nectarine and minerally aromas are textbook as far as Albariño goes. The palate on this ready-to-drink winner is a bit fleshy, but with ample spine. Melon, lees and white pepper flavors finish clean and true, with firm malic acidity."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,19.0,90.0,"Big, dark tannins dominate this concentrated wine that is powerful, dry and firm. Under the structure lies a smoother layer of ripe plum and berry fruits. At 90% Malbec and 10% Merlot, it will certainly need more time to mature; drink from 2018."
Pinot Noir,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Lomas del Valle,19.0,90.0,"Cherry and berry aromas are direct and vivid, with a slight touch of spice. There's energy to the palate, which is slightly jammy and creamy. Ripe plum and cherry flavors show mild oak notes, while the finish is bright, bold and deals some chocolaty oak."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Hubert Meyer,19.0,90.0,"Not quite dry, this is an impressively rich wine. It has a strong mineral element that brings out the currant flavors and intense acidity. This is a wine that is still developing, offering an impressive array of flavors while still needing time. Drink from 2015."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,19.0,90.0,"Zestiness amid the rounded apricot and rose-petal flavors marks this out, while a pleasant, ever-so-slightly bitter phenolic edge gives just a little bite. The aromatics are subtly expressed and the real action happens on the textured palate."
Red Blend,France,Provence,Domaine de la Sauveuse,19.0,90.0,"Like the estate's Cuvée Carolle, this has a note of volatility and sur-maturité, but it's also bigger, richer and more extracted, with lots of ripe tannins but also thick purple fruit that comes through on the finish. Try in 2010. 40% Syrah, 40% Cab Sauvignon, 10% Mourvèdre, 10% Grenache."
Moscatel,Spain,Andalucia,Jorge Ordóñez & Co.,19.0,90.0,"Orange peel and pine are the main aromas on a slightly oily nose. This feels full and balanced, with flavors of mango, banana and lychee. There isn't a lot of complexity to a citrusy finish, but this still ranks as an excellent sweet Moscatel."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,Anthony Nappa,19.0,90.0,"Winemaker Anthony Nappa describes Anomaly as a Pinot Noir vinified like a white wine. Bone dry, with understated black-cherry flavor, it's bracing with acidity and an intensely chalky, minerally palate. It's refreshingly quaffable, yet lingers long, sip after sip."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Nelson,Neudorf,19.0,90.0,"Admirably concentrated and complex, this is a medium- to full-bodied wine. Passion fruit and snap pea notes combine with citrus zest on the nose, palate and long, mouthwatering finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Carol Shelton,19.0,90.0,"With a dollop of Carignane, also from old vines grown organically in Mendocino County, Carol Shelton's Wild Thing ZIn is a fun ride, rich, robust in juicy raspberry fruit, fragrant in vanilla, balanced and approachable. In screwcap, it's a good bottle to grab on the way to a picnic or barbecue."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Raconteur,19.0,90.0,"Syrah (64%) takes the lead on this blend, which is fleshed out by Grenache (27%) and Mourvèdre. It comes from vineyard sources rarely seen in a bottle at this price, including Boushey, Olsen, Les Collines, Stoney Vine and Destiny Ridge. Aromas of sage and herbs lead to a panoply of sleekly styled fruit and savory flavors, showing a pleasing sense of balance."
Grillo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Tonnino,19.0,90.0,"Lovely scents of white spring flower, white stone fruit and citrus set the tone on this vibrant savory white. On the mineral-driven palate, notes of saline and Mediterranean herb accent grapefruit, lemon and white peach. It finishes crisp and clean."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Stadlmann,19.0,90.0,"Zesty, fresh tangerine and grapefruit notes show on the nose of this textbook dry Riesling. The palate brings those fresh, aromatic citrus elements into full force. Though slender and streamlined in body, it's full of life, vibrant juiciness and verve."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,19.0,90.0,"Fragrant and nicely detailed, this sends up clover and apple blossom scents. Apple-infused flavors follow, with touches of peach and spice."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Encostas de Estremoz,19.0,90.0,"This exuberant wine is rich in tannins and fruit. It has power and a direct in-your-face fruitiness. The structure is soft only because there is so much fruit. In fact, it has a firm core. Juicy blackberries and almost refreshing acidity balance this wine that is now ready to drink."
White Blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Zahel,19.0,90.0,"Freshly cut green and red apples vie for attention. Burgeoning fruit on the nose leads to an ultracrisp, lip-smacking palate of lemon peel flavours. This is a wine to provide refreshment on a hot summer day—mouthwatering and light-footed as it is. The textured palate offers a backbone and is an ideal canvas for all manner of food."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Minho,Casa do Valle,19.0,90.0,"Homenagem is an homage to the current owner's father and grandfather. With its rich fruit, this field blend made from old vines, breaks the mold of reds from the north of Portugal. Dense and firm, it has a tannic element as well as acidity. It is ready to drink now."
Champagne Blend,France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre,19.0,90.0,"This is a classic Burgundian version of a Champagne blend—made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from the cool areas around Chablis. It's bright and fruity, tangy with lemon zest and a fine streak of minerality, and finishes with an attractive, creamy edge. Drink now."
Greco,Italy,Southern Italy,Torricino,19.0,90.0,"Here's a textbook Greco di Tufo that opens with delicate but alluring scents of ripe orchard fruit, orange blossom and a whiff of toasted almond. The crisp yet creamy palate doles out ripe pear, peach and citrus while bright acidity lifts the finish. It closes on a mineral note."
Vermentino,France,France Other,Clos Venturi,19.0,90.0,"Eight months on lees before bottling give this wine its rich, concentrated character. Melon and green-plum fruits are poised and stylish, pointed up by a touch of pepper. It is ripe, full bodied, ready to drink in 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Three Rivers,19.0,90.0,"This is almost pure Cab, with the addition of just 2% Malbec. Solidly in the firm, muscular, polished style of winemaker Holly Turner, this is a substantial effort that will need to be decanted if you are going to drink it any time soon. Black cherry, cassis and blue plum are swathed in milk chocolate, but this is Cabernet with its sinews intact, showing streaks of herb, smoke and light pepper. I can't imagine a better companion to it than a good, rare steak."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,Suavia,19.0,90.0,"Aromas of Spanish broom, tropical fruit and graphite take the lead. The smooth, creamy palate offers white peach, melon, almond and mineral brightened by crisp acidity. Enjoy now through 2016."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Erste Neue,19.0,90.0,"Aromas of exotic fruit, green melon and crushed tomato vine carry over to the palate along with a mineral note. The vibrant acidity gives a linear character and a clean, focused finish. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Dunham,19.0,90.0,"This is a blend of almost 50% Syrah, with Sangiovese, Cabernet and splashes of three other grapes. Jumping from the glass are flavors of juicy raspberry and sweet cherry swathed in a note of chocolate."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Flying Dreams,19.0,90.0,"A textbook example of Washington Sauvignon Blanc, this is bright, racy, juicy and vibrant, with an array of crisp, clean fruit flavors. Citrus, grapefruit and pear are all in the mix, accented with notes of sweet grain from aging in new oak."
Viognier,US,Washington,Nefarious,19.0,90.0,"As with all Nefarious wines, balance is the key to success. Whiffs of toast, smoke and sea breeze introduce a delicate, estate-grown wine, with pretty melon, pear and apple notes. Complex and graceful."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Ferraud et Fils,19.0,90.0,"Firm wine that is packed with tannins as well as solid fruit. The wine is concentrated with a dense plum skin texture. Chunky, perfumed and solid."
Pinotage,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Neil Ellis,19.0,90.0,"A nose of spicy, jammy, balanced fruit leads on this exemplary Pinotage from Neil Ellis. The wine offers a very appealing blend of red fruit and spice, and while the acidity is pronounced, the mouthfeel is full and elegant. All the hallmarks of Pinotage with a classy edge."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Enoport,19.0,90.0,"Still showing strongly spicy aromas from the nine months wood aging, this is a ripe and fruity blend of Touriga Nacional and Castelão. It is still structured with a dry, toasty character. As this softens, it will become richer and generous. Drink from 2016."
Zinfandel,US,California,Klinker Brick,19.0,90.0,"This wine is rich, ripe, concentrated and almost sweet. It's wonderful to smell the raspberry syrup aromas, taste the blueberry and blackberry flavors and feel the creaminess of the texture coating the palate. Low in tannins but high in viscosity, it's a pleasure to sip."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,19.0,90.0,"Very ripe notes of yellow pear appear on the nose. A touch of earthiness adds texture and interest to the palate, as does the merest smidgen of residual sweetness, boosting the fruit flavors. A zesty freshness pulls all into focus. The finish is dry and lasting."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Filus,19.0,90.0,"Lightly volatile, balsamic aromas blend with cedary notes and berry scents. This feels round and fresh, which is typical of the Uco Valley. Blueberry, spiced plum and cassis flavors finish with chocolaty oak and mocha flavors as well as juicy acidity."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaj,Béres,19.0,90.0,"Nuances of white flowers lead you in to aromas of pear and pineapple and flavors of grapefruit, green apple and pear. The finish is mineral driven and delightful."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mi Terruño,19.0,90.0,"Floral red-berry aromas come with a note of wet clay and also a dusting of dried herbs. Wide on the palate, this rubs up against your cheeks. Herbal plum, blueberry and peppery flavors finish with ripeness and freshness. Drink through 2019."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Leyda Valley,San Pedro,19.0,90.0,"Snappy aromas of briny citrus fruits, jalapeño and bell pepper leave no doubt that this is Leyda Sauv Blanc. The palate is minerally and crisp, with juicy acidity. Flavors of lime, pickle brine, gooseberry and wet stone finish elegant and pure, with cleansing acidity."
Assyrtico,Greece,Santorini,Athiná,19.0,90.0,"This full-bodied Assyrtico offers aromas of pineapple, citrus and spice on the nose, while the palate brings layers of fruit, minerals and lemon. Delicious with a good acidity, imagine this white with grilled chicken or fish."
White Blend,Austria,Niederösterreich,Arndorfer,19.0,90.0,"The scent of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples is joined on the palate by fizzing, savory spice and lashings of white pepper in this unusual but fitting blend of Austria's chief varieties: Grüner Veltliner and Riesling. One brings spice and savory flavors, the other lots of verve and apple fruit. It has the freshness of 2014 and lots of personality. It should become a party favorite!"
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Capannelle,19.0,90.0,"Aromas of sun-baked earth, pressed iris, wild berry, underbrush and a whiff of game lead the nose. The round, open palate delivers fleshy black cherry, ripe plum, ground pepper, leather and anise alongside velvety tannins. It's already accessible but will hold up well for the next few years. Drink through 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Alma Rosa,19.0,90.0,"A tight line of margarita salt, lemon and sourdough toast show on the layered nose of this countywide blend that is one of the stronger performers in the Alma Rosa catalogue for the price. There is a steely texture to the sip, with flavors of wet wool, Marcona almond and tangerine blossom."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Winzer Krems,19.0,90.0,"Fresh lemon flesh and an edge of white pepper play on the nose. The palate has the same spicy freshness; the body is slender, fresh, dry and light. Glimpses of spicy white pepper appear time and again amid ripe notions of yellow Mirabelle plum."
Boğazkere,Turkey,Cappadocia,Turasan,19.0,90.0,"Dark ruby in the glass, this wine has a nose of blackberry, cassis and smoke. It is round in the mouth with bold acidity that does not overtake the silky tannins. Flavors of cassis, cherry pie, flint, anisette and violet continue into a finish that lingers with equal parts smooth tannins and bright acidity."
Rotgipfler,Austria,Thermenregion,Stadlmann,19.0,90.0,"The intriguing nose suggests the ripe flesh of yellow plums drizzled with lemon juice, this is subtly aromatic and immensely appetizing. Riper fruit is revealed on the slight and light palate, once again tempered by lemony freshness. If you like exquisite lightness, this is your ideal, barely-there summer wine. If you have yet to discover Rotgipfler, you are in for a rewarding surprise."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Gagliole,19.0,90.0,"Bright and savory, this opens with aromas of blue flowers, mint, dark berry and an earthy whiff of underbrush. The firm palate doles out black cherry, crushed raspberry, peppermint and white pepper alongside firm, sleek tannins. Drink through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,San Juan Vineyards,19.0,90.0,"This wine displays brooding aromas of dried herbs, Bing cherry, dusty chocolate, black licorice, cinnamon and high-toned barrel spices. It's medium bodied, supple and palate-coating in feel, with tart cranberry flavors on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Charmail,19.0,90.0,"Unusually for the Médoc, this wine has a significant percentage (14.5%) of Cabernet Franc as well as 12.5% Petit Verdot. These two grapes give the wine its perfume and its dark color. They add to the rich tannins and juicy black currants that pack the wine. Drink this fine wine from 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Pech Merle,19.0,90.0,"A stainless-steel fermented wine, this shows shy elements of grass and herb before delving into fulsome, weighty waves of high-toned melon and peach. Relatively full-bodied in style, it's hearty and welcoming."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,19.0,90.0,"Whiffs of lanolin and white flowers add freshness to this lavishly honeyed, deliciously fruity Riesling. Its sweet stone-fruit flavors are balanced with a spray of fresh lime acidity, giving it a lingering but refreshing finish."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Inama,19.0,90.0,"Full of the concentration lacking in so many Soaves, this single-vineyard wine is intense, with ripe toast and nut flavors. The fruit has a touch of honeyed botrytis, balanced with a light layer of acidity."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Smasne Cellars,19.0,90.0,"A standout in a flight of more expensive wines, this five-grape blend leans heavily on the Bordeaux varietals, with a bit of Syrah as well. Firm and complex, its black cherry, cassis and plum fruit flavors are nicely accented by baking spices and red licorice. The balance is perfect; the finish carries a suggestion of dried leaf."
Roussanne,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,19.0,90.0,"For Roussanne, this is surprisingly neutral on the nose. It's marginally more expressive on the palate, where it offers hints of paraffin and toasted marshmallow. Still, it's plump and mouthfilling, with an attractive hint of ginger on the long finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Fossil Point,19.0,90.0,"This lower-priced Pinot from the Center of Effort team punches way above its weight in this vintage, showing light cherry-blossom and black-cherry aromas mixed with gamy meat and wet slate. Blackberry pie is cut with orange rind on the sip, with an earthy grip showing flavors of juniper, crushed clove and pipe tobacco."
Rosé,France,Provence,Les Vins Bréban,19.0,90.0,"Packed with fruit and spice, this is a great food wine. It is full bodied, rich with raspberry flavors gathered into a structure of light tannins and edgy minerality. The aftertaste brings out a crisper character."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Markowitsch,19.0,90.0,"A creamy dollop of oaky, vanilla and cinnamon-scented richness bolsters the black cherry fruit of Zweigelt. The palate shows that there is ample, generous and vibrant fruit which has a real seam of vivid freshness at its core. Black cherry and blueberry notes flit across the smooth, rounded but medium-bodied palate and leave you wanting more."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château Jolys,19.0,90.0,"This sweet wine balances acidity with honeyed fruit. There is a touch of botrytis to go with the orange marmalade and lemon peel flavors, while the citrus-like acids cut across the palate. This is fine to drink now, yet it will also age for many years."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Estampa,19.0,90.0,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend comes with a deep, minerally aroma as well as with lush black-fruit, herb and spice notes. The feel is plump and smooth, while the core flavors are of blackberry, tobacco, raw oak and spice. It's predominantly round and ripe, but there's more than enough crispness and tannic bite to keep things framed."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Coeur de Terre,19.0,90.0,"Back to previous high standards, this shows excellent concentration, freshness and purity. Crisp apple and pear fruits set up brightly against vivid acids. There's a light touch of buttery caramel running through the finish. Drink now through 2018."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Keuka Lake Vineyards,19.0,90.0,"On the nose, biscuit-crumb notes add a touch of sweetness to the crisp black-cherry and cassis scents. On the palate, darker tones of dried herb and briar patch contrast the lush black-fruit and violet flavors that linger luxuriously on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Nardou,19.0,90.0,"A smooth, beautifully rich wine with great swathes of ripe fruit. The wine is concentrated and dense, showing the best of the year with its fine, ripe fruits. Age for 3–4 years."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Emina,19.0,90.0,"For a big-production wine (33,000 cases) with just 12 months of barrel aging, this is impressive. Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola. Complex and slightly gritty and tannic on the finish, which indicates that it has the structure to age. Drink now through 2013."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Haut-Monplaisir,19.0,90.0,"This is a powerhouse of ripe fruits, strong tannins and dark acidity. It burst out of the glass with its bold, firm flavors and solid structure. It is already balanced, the fruit complementing the dense texture. But it will certainly develop more and age very well. Drink in 2016 and until 2022."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine des Terres Dorées,19.0,90.0,"This is a delicious, ripe and fruity wine that comes from the south of Beaujolais. It has ripe red-berry fruits and soft tannins allied to a juicy acidity that keeps it all fresh. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Esk Valley,19.0,90.0,"The blend is 44% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Malbec. The result is a medium- to full-bodied wine with firm structure that should drink well through 2020. Leather, earth and plum notes pick up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish."
Albariño,US,Oregon,J. Scott Cellars,18.0,90.0,"Not such a rarity these days, Albariño is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit. It's leesy and textural, tasting of wet stones: in sum, a wonderfully refreshing summer white."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Dei,18.0,90.0,"Ripe black plum, forest floor, mint and spice notes lead the nose on this savory, medium-bodied red. The succulent, straightforward palate doles out fleshy black cherry and crushed raspberry accented with black pepper and clove alongside round tannins. Drink through 2015."
White Blend,Austria,Wiener Gemischter Satz,Zahel,18.0,90.0,"Slight reduction still obstructs this wine's nose. The palate, however, is both zingy and rich—spiked with citrus and rounded with ripe, mellow apple fruit. There is verve and life at its core and tone to its medium body. The dry finish is appetizing."
Rosé,US,New York,Damiani,18.0,90.0,"Deep penetrating sour-cherry and raspberry flavors are balanced against brisk blood-orange acidity in this dry Pinot Noir rosé. Full bodied and slightly silky on the palate, it's a satisfyingly mouthfilling but invigorating wine to enjoy now through the fall months."
Grillo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Feudo Montoni,18.0,90.0,"Spanish broom, yellow stone fruit and citrus zest aromas take shape in the glass. Lively acidity carries juicy nectarine, intense lemon, thyme, pineapple and Mediterranean herb flavors into the round, juicy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Oregon,Melrose,18.0,90.0,"Fragrant with a mix of sweet grass and dusty blossom, this pleasant Sauvignon Blanc makes you wonder why the grape is so rare in Oregon. Here in the Umpqua Valley it finds a sweet spot, fresh and varietal, round and tart, with the added complexity of the flowery aromatics."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,18.0,90.0,"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years."
Red Blend,Italy,Central Italy,Di Filippo,18.0,90.0,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this blend of 60% Sangiovese, 30% Barbera and 10% Sagrantino opens with aromas of tilled earth, blue flower, ripe berry and spice. The dense palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed plum, black pepper and tobacco alongside firm but velvety tannins. It finishes on a succulent note."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,New York,Heron Hill,18.0,90.0,"Deftly calibrating sultry black fruit against savory earth tones, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc offers refinement. Toast, smoke and bramble integrate amid black plum and cherry flavors. The finish is powerful and persistent, fringed with finely grained tannins."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Dão,Borges,18.0,90.0,"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4–5 years."
White Blend,US,Washington,Syncline,18.0,90.0,"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,18.0,90.0,"While a tad more slender in frame than many of 2015's single-vineyard Kabinetts, this delicate Riesling offers a zesty punch of sweet-tart tangerine and quince flavors. It's irresistibly thirst quenching, finishing on a salty tang of mineral and lime."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Columbia Winery,18.0,90.0,"This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine."
Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Château Jolys,18.0,90.0,"Honey flavored wine, packed with botrytis and also with intense acidity. That makes the wine light, dancing, while also showing richness. It is all so light, delicate, so delicious."
Shiraz-Grenache,Australia,South Australia,Chapel Hill,18.0,90.0,"Well priced for the quality, Chapel Hill's Shiraz-Grenache is barely a blend, with only 10% Grenache. It comes across as a nicely complex, easy-drinking Shiraz, marrying mulberry fruit with hints of chocolate, cracked pepper and fresh herbs. The texture is plush and the finish long; a super value at under $20 to drink now and over the next few years."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Chateau de Manissy,18.0,90.0,"A surprising 30% of this wine is Clairette, a white grape variety. Perhaps that accounts for the wine's apparent freshness. Hints of crushed stone mark the nose, while the ripe flavors suggest peaches and berries, tailing away slowly on the finish. Drink this mouthfilling rosé over the rest of 2017."
Syrah,Morocco,Zenata,Ouled Thaleb,18.0,90.0,"Deep garnet to the eye, this wine offers a nose of black cherry, cassis and butterscotch. It is a soft and easy-drinking red, with flavors of tart cherry, cranberry, white chocolate and pencil lead. Surprisingly deft tannins float on the palate into a bright pomegranate finish."
Altesse,France,France Other,Domaine de l'Idylle,18.0,90.0,"This is a full, fragrant and brilliantly fresh wine. It is crisp, with a rounded character that gives richness to the bright apples and pear-skin flavors. Lively while ripe, it has an attractive, mineral aftertaste."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,90.0,This is a bold and ripely fruity wine. Fine tannins and blackberry fruits are already well combined in a big and juicy whole. The wine does have a structure and layers of wood aging that suggest it will age. Drink from 2018.
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Joël Delaunay,18.0,90.0,"From selected parcels on this estate, this wine is rich and with great intensity. It has a flinty character that will allow it to age. Its apple and citrus fruits are balanced by the concentrated taut texture and finished with acidity. Drink this wine from 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Wittmann,18.0,90.0,"Exuberant and fresh, this vivacious dry Riesling is anchored in cutting citrus tones of lime, lemon and tangerine. Medium bodied on the palate, it's racy, crystalline style is endlessly quaffable."
Sémillon,US,California,Fenestra,18.0,90.0,"Made in a delicious, dry style, this has a vivid yellow-gold color, lemon and butter aromas, a touch of honey in the Bosc pear flavors and a creamy texture that leads to a long finish. Not much of this variety is made in California and the acreage is dwindling in Livermore Valley, so this bottling is a rare treat."
Muscat,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,18.0,90.0,"There should be more Muscat planted in Alsace if this fine wine is anything to go by. It brings out all the ethereal perfume of the grape, offering a ripe character while remaining delicate and elegant. The acidity lightens the final tone."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,18.0,90.0,"While racy and spry, this delicately framed wine packs a punch of honeyed peach and nectarine flavors. It's effusively fresh, floral and fruity, yet accentuated by a crystalline sheen of minerality. Drink now."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Roches Neuves,18.0,90.0,"Obviously young, but with good acidity as well as bright red fruit flavors. The wine's acidity balances the juicy fruits well. Its structure suggests a good few years' aging."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider,18.0,90.0,"While aromatically subdued, this semidry, late-harvest Riesling is surprisingly exuberant on the palate. Sunny and bright grapefruit and apricot flavors coat the tongue in rich, almost creamy, layers, lingering through a bracing lemon-lime finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Dürnberg,18.0,90.0,"Lemon balm, peppery arugula and yeasty savoriness combine into a sleek, streamlined wine that goes down all too easily—notwithstanding its wonderful layers and length. The lemony finish lasts and refreshes."
Primitivo,Italy,Southern Italy,Cantine Paolo Leo,18.0,90.0,"Made from 40-year-old, bush-trained vines, this opens with earthy aromas of charred earth, smoke, grilled sage and black spice. The concentrated but elegant palate delivers mature blackberry, dried black cherry, allspice and pipe tobacco alongside velvety tannins."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Buchegger,18.0,90.0,"It conveys the purest scent of cut green pears, a crisp but cushioned body, and zesty, citrusy freshness. It's very complete and for immediate consumption."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,18.0,90.0,"Yalumba has been pushing the organic envelope in recent years, and this Shiraz is a winner. It's full bodied and supple nearly to the point of creaminess, but delivers mixed berry, vanilla and baking-spice flavors, all with a certain amount of elegance. Drink now–2022."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Alta Maria,18.0,90.0,"Aromas recall freshly chopped herbs such as thyme and parsley, with a very likable hint of pine tar as well. That mix of tree resin and Italian herbs comes through on the palate too, making for a flavorful and stand-out wine."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,18.0,90.0,"Pinot Gris from 2013 is looking very good in the Willamette, with crisp, concise, complex flavors. Here it's a mix of lemon, lime and pineapple, with refreshing minerality."
Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Tenuta Roveglia,18.0,90.0,"Fragrant and refreshing, this savory white opens with delicate scents of white spring flower, orchard fruit and a whisper of crushed herb. The tangy palate delivers white peach, yellow pear and a hint of nectarine that linger on the crisp finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Draxton,18.0,90.0,"Creamy in mouthfeel and spicy with acidity, this is a well-heeled, lightly crafted wine with integrated crispness and peach and lemon highlights."
Rosé,US,California,K Squared Cellars,18.0,90.0,"Fermented in stainless steel barrels, this wine is a vibrant red hue, with strong dried cherry, cranberry and orange aromas. Full-bodied and concentrated, it's a dry and substantial rosé."
Rosé,Austria,Weinland Österreich,Markus Huber,18.0,90.0,An appetizing touch of red currant and cranberry plays on the nose of this vividly colored rosé. The palate is fruit-forward with subtle shades of berry and citrus. The finish is refreshing and berry-laden.
Pinot Gris,New Zealand,Central Otago,Kawarau Estate,18.0,90.0,"A broad, richly textured wine made in a dry style, this packs in the pear, nectarine and melon flavors, then wraps them up with touches of spice on a harmonious, long finish. Drink now."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Mittelburgenland,Weninger,18.0,90.0,"Pepper and focus characterize the slender, tart fruit of this refreshing, vibrant red. The tannins have that lovely palpable verve that signals just a little rusticity. Have this with hearty food or charcuterie. Thanks to the fresh acidity this is rather versatile with food—experiment."
Castelão,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,90.0,The wine reveals a serious side to Castelão that is not often shown. Its wood aging and structured character give the wine longevity as well as solid fruits and concentrated tannins. Lightness comes in the form of the acidity and the juicy black fruits. Drink from 2019.
Riesling,France,Alsace,Wolfberger,18.0,90.0,"Lime and lemon zest are joined by aromatic citrus foliage on the nose. The palate replays these sprightly refreshing notes and lets them ripple across the slender palate. This is light, dry and will put a spring in your step with its citrus liveliness."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,R&A; Pfaffl,18.0,90.0,"The savory, yeasty nose comes with a hint of spicy sandalwood. The palate echoes this rounded harmonious spiciness and plays more to those mellow tones than to the shades of fruit. The body comes with a lovely, inviting and appetizing light-footedness. The finish is long and clean."
Chardonnay,US,California,Buehler,18.0,90.0,"Searing acidity supports apple blossom and quince in this complex, light-bodied and entirely delightful wine. As it opens in the glass, it gets more velvety and tense, finishing on a refreshing bite of anise."
Jacquère,France,France Other,Les Rocailles,18.0,90.0,"The old vines give extra depth and richness to this ripe, creamy wine. It still has the proper crisp, tight texture that gives these cool mountain wines their character. Melon, crisp pear and acidity are all well in balance with the tangy aftertaste. Drink now."
Rosé,US,New York,Sheldrake Point,18.0,90.0,"Crisp raspberry, red-cherry and blossom notes lend exhilarating freshness to this Cabernet Franc rosé. Dry in style yet concentrated and juicy, it's an irresistible quaffer that you'll want to keep drinking long after the summer's end."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Quinta de Paços,18.0,90.0,"Named after the 13th-century house at the center of the estate, this is a rich, full-bodied wine. With citrus flavors at its heart, it also shows a texture that gives minerality from the granite soil, followed by juicy yellow fruits and finishing with intense acidity. Give this wine until mid-2015 to settle down."
Malvasia,Croatia,Istria,Kozlović,18.0,90.0,"An aromatic mélange of lemon custard, apple pie and salted caramel intrigue your nose while crisp flavors of lemon rind, citrus zest and grapefruit delight your palate. Pair this wine with freshly shucked oysters on a warm summer's day."
Cabernet Franc,US,California,Camp,18.0,90.0,"This is an elegant, light-bodied and varietally compelling wine for a value-minded price. Lively acidity keeps it fresh on the palate, with delicious sparks of raspberry, cedar, pencil lead and clove. It finishes lengthy and complex."
Barbera,US,California,Boeger,18.0,90.0,"Smoky, earthy, black pepper aromas make this wine catchy at the first sniff, and then the flavors fill the mouth with similarly spicy, earthy suggestions. It is full-bodied, firm-textured and quite concentrated. Pour this with venison or smoked duck or another game dish if possible."
Greco,Italy,Southern Italy,Cantine di Marzo,18.0,90.0,"Juicy and delicious, this has aromas of ripe orchard fruit and fragrant Spanish broom. The succulent palate doles out crisp Granny Smith apple, Anjou pear, nectarine and mineral alongside bright acidity."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Willamette Valley Vineyards,18.0,90.0,"When a rosé pushes past 14% alcohol, that's an indication of a pretty potent wine. Here's a fine example, showcasing ripe strawberry and peach fruit, with excellent concentration and mouth-filling flavors. Using all free-run juice, this is fresh and full-bodied."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Cecchi,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of underbrush, wild flower, leather and ripe berry lead the nose. The juicy palate offers black cherry, cinnamon, anise and a hint of game alongside fresh acidity and velvety tannins. Drink through 2017."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Seven Hills,18.0,90.0,"Firm and tartly wound, with cassis and black cherry at the core of a young, stiffly tannic, Cabernet-based blend. Black fruits are nuanced with earth and olive, smoke and graphite, all subtle but definitely in view."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Elk Cove,18.0,90.0,"Very youthful, so the first aromas are of a wild field, with some cranberry. It’s a full-volume wine, with an appealing chunky forwardness but also bright acidity, style and character. In a word, it’s “balanced.” Will go with almost anything, from baked salmon to dark chocolate. A real pleaser, especially at this price point. Best Buy."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Victor Vineyards,18.0,90.0,"Full bodied but smooth textured, this is ripe and enticing. The color is like garnet, while the aromas resemble black cherry, black currants and rosemary. Flavors are complex, autumnal and inviting, making this a great discovery."
Rosé,US,New York,Damiani,18.0,90.0,Luscious watermelon and berry aromas perfume this buoyantly fruity dry rosé. It's robust in body and amped with concentrated red-cherry flavor but maintains deft balance. Lingering raspberry notes finish brisk and bright.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Alente,18.0,90.0,"A big, bruising wine that is bursting with sweet tannins and juicy blackberry flavors. All of its acidity and attractive flavors of up-front fruit, spice and wood are clamoring for attention. Ready to drink with strong flavored food."
White Blend,Greece,Peloponnese,Mercouri Estate,18.0,90.0,"This blend of Roditis and Viognier starts with aromas of fresh lemon blossom, sea salt and jasmine, leading into a nimble and delicate array of citrus and spice on the palate. Clean and focused but with a curvaceous edge."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Schloss Gobelsburg,18.0,90.0,"A slight note of pear drop plays on the nose. The palate is juicy and vivid with citrus, green pear and some white pepper. Light on its feet, with an energetic force at its core and lovely concentration of citrus and herb notes, this fizzes away pleasantly. This is far too easy to drink and very, very refreshing."
Zweigelt,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,18.0,90.0,"What a lovely and balanced rendition of Zweigelt: its forest fruit and cherry notes are pure and held in a tight focus on the midpalate. The body is smooth, full-fruited, generous but balanced by vibrant, food-friendly and appetizing freshness. Handled with such bravura, Zweigelt almost attains a Pinot-like elegance—no wonder, since the Reinisch-brothers are masters of their art."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Birot,18.0,90.0,"Rich blackberry and black-currant flavors give this wine its ripe character. They are already well balanced by the spicy tannins and dry core. The wine will develop well and should be ready from 2019. This is the last vintage under the Fournier-Casteja family. In December, Birot was sold to Miaolin Chen's New Century Tourism Group based in Hangzhou, China."
White Blend,US,Oregon,Brooks,18.0,90.0,"This is one of those kitchen sink blends that is better than it has a right to be. Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Gris are all in the mix, and the wine is both aromatic and packed with fresh flavors of bubble gum and tropical fruit candy. It's finished dry, yielding a multipurpose, unique white wine that you may try with just about any food you'd put in front of any of the component grapes."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Adega Cooperativa de Borba,18.0,90.0,"In the classic Portuguese tradition, this is a blend of four of the Alentejo's local grapes. Together they give big power and dark tannins. They also offer great black fruits, fresh acidity and a firm, very dry core. The wine needs to soften over the next several years, so drink from 2017."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,18.0,90.0,"More than a slight hint of blush color (suggesting extra skin contact) leads into this broad, spicy, flavorful wine. Highlights of ginger, cinnamon and sweet baking spices adorn rich, mouthcoating pear fruit. It offers an enjoyable, drink-now style."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,18.0,90.0,"Cola, blackberry and dusty aromas amount to something nice and inviting. Cab Franc is new to the Broquel lineup, and this is lush, bold and fruity in style, with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors in front of a toasty, full-throttle finish."
Pinot Blanc,Germany,Rheinhessen,Wittmann,18.0,90.0,"Forward but fresh, this elegant Pinot Blanc juxtaposes rich peach and mango flavors with a zesty acidic spine. The finish is sleek and a bit steely. Ready now but should drink well through 2020."
Red Blend,Greece,Drama,Domaine Costa Lazaridi,18.0,90.0,"A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Limnio, this is a Bordeaux-like blend offering aromas of clove, mint and blueberry, and black fruit flavors. An elegant and integrated balance of fruit, wooded spice and acid gives the medium-bodied sip ageability. Paired with game or more complex red meat dishes, this blend is a classy alternative from an exotic locale."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,18.0,90.0,"Tamarack's Firehouse Red incorporates 12 different grapes in the blend, though most are in tiny percentages. Nonetheless the wine is focused and deep, with luscious boysenberry, licorice and dark chocolate flavors wrapping together in a complex and textural whole."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Ten Sisters,18.0,90.0,"This medium-bodied wine shows a remarkable evolution on the palate, where it accelerates through tight, reined-in notions of gun flint and vague leafiness to pinwheels of pink grapefruit and tomato leaf by the long finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Vinum Ferus,18.0,90.0,"Quite tart, in a bracing, food friendly way, this foot-stomped rosé brings pretty notes of crushed roses and sweet cherries to the fore. There's impressive body and length, with a lick of citrus extending the finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Olsen Estates,18.0,90.0,"A six-grape Rhône blend, this does not lose focus or intensity. It strikes the palate head-on with flavors of dried leaf, prune, cooked cherry, cinnamon and mocha. But despite the raisin/prune flavors, it does not seem overripe or in any way over the hill. Rather, these superripe flavors have somehow been tamed, the alcohol is just over 14%, and the wine leaves a sinuous, sensuous trail of flavor as it moves through the palate."
Mauzac,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château Rives-Blanques,18.0,90.0,"A young wine that needs time to flesh out, this currently offers intense notes of garrigue and fresh, green herbs that are framed by fruity tones of green plum and lime leaf. Tart citrus, pear and underripe stone fruit flavors unfold on the medium-weight palate, with hints of hay and beeswax on the finish. Drink 2018–2022."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lemelson,18.0,90.0,"This is a rich, barrel fermented style that delivers creamy, layered, textured flavors accented with flower, white pepper and mineral notes. A smack of butterscotch finishes it beautifully."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Oregon,Cuneo,18.0,90.0,"Inky and dense, with plum-cake aromas along with nuances of tree bark and nutmeg. The more time you give this ripe, tannic red, the more it'll offer. The fruit is pure and ripe, and the tannins are anything but meek. On the finish, root beer, chocolate and vanilla notes add some complexity and sweetness. The fruit is 61% Columbia Valley (Wash.) and 39% southern Oregon, and the whole is a fine yet brawny offering."
Riesling,US,Washington,Gård,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of beeswax and lemon oil, the flavors following along with tangerine, orange and peach. Very dry, with exceptional concentration of fruit, and well-integrated flavors of cracker and grain. This was barrel fermented, and delivers a long, concentrated finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Haut Bourg,18.0,90.0,"From old vines and only produced in the best years, this is a wine that is mature while preserving a crisp, tight character. It has some toastiness as well as melon and apple fruits. Concentrated and with fine acidity, it is ready to drink."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Walnut City WineWorks,18.0,90.0,"Always aromatic, here the scents of jasmine and honeysuckle are prelude to a dry, yeasty, lightly honeyed wine with lime, orange and golden delicious apple fruit. The penetrating finish carries notes of beeswax and fruit leather."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Ego Bodegas,18.0,90.0,"Rich berry and graham-cracker aromas announce a ripe, easygoing Monastrell-Syrah blend. Chewy and slightly sinewy in feel, this offers heaps of tasty but creamy oak and vanilla to go with spicy, herbal berry fruit. A creamy, thick finish is fitting for a warm-climate wine like this."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Blanco Nieva,18.0,90.0,"Grassy aromas along with capsicum, nettle and green fruit aromas are pungent and exciting. The palate is spritzy and lively, while the flavor profile balances sweet, candied green fruit flavors with more driving, intense tastes of lime and green melon. Forward, fun and elevated; drink now for ultimate freshness."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Bélingard,18.0,90.0,"From selected parcels of Château Bélingard, this is a great success for the cool 2007 vintage. There is black berry richness to balance the severe tannins, while the element of freshness is well integrated into the final stalky acidity. Age for 3–4 years."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Baron Knyphausen,18.0,90.0,"While herbaceous and green on the nose, this almost-dry kabinett is luscious and fruity on the palate, with bursts of white grapefruit and tangerine. It's bold and expansive in mouthfeel, with a brace of citrus pith on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Roquefort,18.0,90.0,"Smooth and spicy, this is an attractive, rounded and ripe wine. It has weight and richness from wood and black plum and currant fruits. The acidity is a fine counterpoint. Drink from 2016."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Cascina Liuzzi,18.0,90.0,"Firm and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature plum, underbrush, baked earth, vanilla and exotic spice. The high-toned, chewy palate doles out ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, vanilla, mocha, white pepper and mint alongside polished tannins."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Balletto,18.0,90.0,"Stainless-steel fermented, this wine remains pungently aromatic in woody, earthy tones, with accents of fragrant orange blossom and pear, while staying crisp and light on the palate. Honey and lemon combine on the complex finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Felsner,18.0,90.0,"Hints of ripe apricot and ethereal notes of crushed boxwood add interest to the more usual aromatic spectrum of green pear and white pepper. A lovely phenolic grip provides extra dimension and calls for food. Rounded, intriguing but still very refreshing."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Herdade do Perdigão,18.0,90.0,"Firm and ripe, this is a richly juicy wine full of berries. Sweet tannins dominate the firmer structure at the back. There is some concentration and the wine is still young, so it's best to drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Kingston Family,18.0,90.0,"Initially this is simply clean as a whistle and smells almost like water, but give it time to breathe and out come minerally citrus and cactus-like aromas. In the mouth, this is stony and well structured; flavors of citrus and nopal are slightly briny and salty, while the finish has a cutting but fine feel."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Elizabeth Chambers,18.0,90.0,"This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip."
Carignan,Chile,Maule Valley,Oveja Negra,18.0,90.0,"Powerful, pure aromas of cherry, cassis and leather stay focused as the wine unwinds. The wine's body, tannins and acids are in harmony, supporting intense flavors of cherry, berry, roasted meat and chocolate. Chewy on the finish, with sweet pastry accents. Drink now–2015."
Malbec,US,Washington,Lookout Point,18.0,90.0,"An excellent follow up to the winery's 2008 Malbec, this well-made wine includes 5% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot—all from the Two Coyote Vineyard. Cherries and plums are lightly dusted with an accent of cocoa from having spent 21 months in 30% new oak. The finish is clean as a whistle."
Riesling,US,New York,Keuka Lake Vineyards,18.0,90.0,"There's a steely polish to this laser-focused dry Riesling. Crisp apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors are refreshing, but serve more as a backdrop to intense minerality. It's a brisk yet penetrating wine with a long, linear finish. Drink now–2017."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Handley,18.0,90.0,"A wisp of a wine, bright in lime, nutmeg and honeysuckle, with balanced acidity and mouthwatering texture and concentration. Handley's Gewürztraminer is always the right call when Thai or Chinese is on the menu. A nice introduction or re-introduction to Anderson Valley whites."
Muscat,US,Oregon,Noble Estate,18.0,90.0,"This lightly sparkling, low-alcohol wine is off dry but with bracing acidity. It features a refreshing mix of apple, peach and citrus fruit, making it perfect as a chilled apéritif, or as a mixer for a wine punch or cocktail."
Chenin Blanc,US,California,Leo Steen Wines,18.0,90.0,"From the oldest Chenin Blanc vines in the Dry Creek Valley, winemaker Leo Hansen crafts a dry, floral white with textured character and nuanced acidity that's garnished with layers of apple, herb and pear, and just a suggestion of tropical flourish on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,18.0,90.0,"Waxy white flowers and peaches scent this ripe, penetrating Riesling full of sweet tangerine and stone-fruit flavors. Fresh lime and mineral tones accent the palate, leading a long, lingering finish. It's effortlessly quaffable yet elegant and complex."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Lange,18.0,90.0,"Lime and pineapple, peach and crisp acidity mark this as a fresh, go-to style. The label notes it was fermented both in stainless steel and French oak barrels. It's balanced and true to the fruit and the elegant vintage. Just a hint of butterscotch comes through."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Bairrada,Luis Pato,18.0,90.0,"Six months barrel aging have given this wine richness and spicy texture. It is rounded, full of peach and white fruit flavors and with a complex texture. It's still young, drinkable now but much better from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Recougne,18.0,90.0,"Spicy, ripe and fruity, this wine has enough structure to give shape to the broad black fruits that are the stars. A smoky element comes from just the right amount of wood aging. Drink from 2017."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Adami,18.0,90.0,"Made by refermenting in the bottle and leaving it on its lees without disgorging, this offers savory flavors of juicy lime, ripe pear, mineral and a yeasty note of baked bread alongside a soft mousse. It's dry and balanced with lively acidity."
Sémillon,US,Washington,Beresan,18.0,90.0,"Always estate grown and 100% varietal, Beresan makes one of the best Sémillons in the state. Exceptionally dry and crisp, this again suggests sweet grain, citrus and light tropical fruits. Notes of lemon oil and even a hint of diesel come in as subtleties. Though not as full-bodied and rich as the 2006, it's an excellent, well-made bottle, more in the style of a Bordeaux blanc."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Vignobles Bulliat,18.0,90.0,"Developed by winemaker Loic Bulliat, this wine comes from an estate owned by his family. It's structured, firm with tannins and juicy acidity. The wine needs aging to allow the tannins to integrate with the red-berry fruits. Drink from 2019."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Argiolas,18.0,90.0,"Vibrant and spicy, this savory red delivers aromas and flavors of ripe blackberry, black cherry, ground pepper and chopped Mediterranean herb. Firm, fine-grained tannins support the juicy flavors. An anise note backs up the finish."
Riesling,US,Idaho,Cinder,18.0,90.0,"There's no mistaking the variety here, with its attention-getting aromas of flowers, mandarin orange and ripe peach, along with lime-zest accents. It drinks off dry, with a plentiful, rich, flavorful palate. There's loads of enjoyment to be had."
Duras,France,Southwest France,Domaine des Terrisses,18.0,90.0,"This is a wine that varies year by year according to the quality of the harvest. With 2015 a very good vintage in the Southwest, the 100% Duras wine shows well. It's ripe and earthy with sustaining tannins and flavors of ripe plums and rhubarb. It's a wine to age for a few years to soften the tannins and bring it all together. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Wildhurst,18.0,90.0,"Abundant flavors and fresh-tasting acidity come together in this full-bodied wine to form a complete, complex package. Yes, there is a vivid streak of vanilla and nutmeg from aging in all American oak barrels but the ripe apple flavors and underlying crispness keep those from overwhelming."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Iris Vineyards,18.0,90.0,"Roughly half the fruit is estate grown. Lush, potent aromatics introduce an impressively concentrated wine, abundant in fresh pear flavor. An orange liqueur highlight adds a sharp, well-defined note to the finish. This wine should develop nicely through 2018 or 2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Leyda Valley,Leyda,18.0,90.0,"Briny, lightly green citrus aromas are round and pungent. A juicy, crisp mouthfeel is formed by citric acidity, while flavors of stony lime and green apple finish crisp and in fine form."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Clos Troteligotte,18.0,90.0,"A big, bold wine that is full of dense fruit and sweet berry flavors. It has weight and richness, the structure stuffed with pure, ripe Malbec fruit that has not been in wood. Delicious and worth aging 2–3 years."
G-S-M,France,Rhône Valley,Pierre Henri Morel,18.0,90.0,"Ready to drink now, this blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre displays hints of roasted fruit and game on the nose. It's full in body, supple in texture and velvety on the finish, making it a solid choice for roasts or braises this winter."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Six Sigma Ranch,18.0,90.0,"Tasty and well integrated, this offers fresh fruit flavors married to subtle oak nuances. It's medium bodied and balanced in acidity, which bolsters the ripe fruit flavors, vanilla and baking spice accents."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Sleight of Hand,18.0,90.0,"Sourced from the Blackrock Vineyard, production has quadrupled with no loss of quality. Pale copper, wonderfully aromatic, and showing the muscle and verve of the grape, this artfully melds scents and flavors of rose petals and peaches, with a touch of well-ripened tannin."
Viognier,US,Washington,Coeur d'Alene,18.0,90.0,"This is 100% Viognier, different from the winery's varietally labeled version in that it is 100% stainless-steel fermented. The result is a less round and toasty wine, but one that, in this vintage at least, offers more focus and precision. Peach and apricot, tangerine and tropical fruits are on display, and the finish winds down gently, with none of the heat or bitterness that can affect some Viogniers."
Syrah,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Viña Casablanca,18.0,90.0,"Spicy and earthy, with truffle, toast and strawberry aromas. The palate is bright and smooth, with a well-matched mix of plush fruit and juicy acidity. This is the first Nimbus Estate wine we've reviewed, and the early word is that this vineyard can produce Syrah with character as well as size. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Syncline,18.0,90.0,"This Syrah/Grenache/Mourvèdre blend, finished in screwcap, is always one of Washington's best values and flat out most delicious Rhône blends. The 2006 is the best ever, with dark, supple fruits that weave together berries, cherries, plums, cassis, licorice, pepper and Provençal herbs. It's a riot of flavors, young and brash, but perfectly capable of aging."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Six Sigma Ranch,18.0,90.0,"Vanilla and fig hints add interest to this medium-bodied, richly textured wine. It's quietly fruity, suggesting honeydew melon, and has complex layers that unfold on the palate. It's a very good example of how this grape variety thrives in Lake County."
Merlot,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta de Sant'Ana,18.0,90.0,"A really perfumed wine, full of oak and truffle aromas. With its juicy rich fruit, it is not a shy wine. Bold red fruits, balanced tannins and a ripe texture all contribute to the dense concentration. The alcohol shows in the pepper edge. Drink this just mature wine now."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Seven Hills,18.0,90.0,"This light-peach-colored wine brings appealing aromas of peppery spice, watermelon, citrus and herb. The flavors are dry and broad in feel, with a pleasing lick of acidity that keeps the interest high."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,18.0,90.0,"The nose of this wine is restrained, just giving away pear and citrus, but the dry palate is concentrated and spiced with almond and marzipan. Ample tone from mouthwatering acidity will make this a huge winner at any table. It has great poise and balance."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Barrymore by Carmel Road,18.0,90.0,"This may be the best bottling yet by actress Drew Barrymore and her team. The pale-pink wine offers light pink lemonade, plum, cherry and bubblegum aromas. The palate combines lime juice, pluot flesh and mandarin zest, set against a chalky backbone and laced with bright acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Charles Krug,18.0,90.0,"Fresh and lively in green grass, melon and pear, this well-made wine is restrained in ripeness and body, opting to highlight its stony minerality and a touch of gravel on the texture. It finishes light and breezy."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Westrey,18.0,90.0,"Tart and tangy, with cleansing acidity, this is a Pinot Gris ready for fresh shellfish, oysters, and mussels. The lemony fruit is marked by a touch of pineapple, showing good focus, concentration and length."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Brigadoon,18.0,90.0,"One quarter of this Riesling was aged in neutral barrels, the rest in stainless steel, finishing at just 10 g/L of residual sugar to yield a round, racy palate of fresh herb, apple and melon flavors. A subtle note of butter and spice emerges as the finish winds down."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Salomon-Undhof,18.0,90.0,"A creamy, smooth wine, flavored with pears, even lychees and full, ripe Grüner Veltliner. This shows the rich side of the grape, while still keeping its essential freshness. Typical pepper flavors come to finish. Glass stopper."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Baricci,18.0,90.0,"Pretty aromas of underbrush, crushed blue flower and perfumed berries lead the nose on this robust Rosso. The dense palate delivers succulent black cherry, raspberry, mocha and sweet cake spices alongside firm tannins. It's not an ager so enjoy soon."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château de Pizay,18.0,90.0,"This serious wine is still very young. Its black fruits and firm tannins are showing considerable potential, with acidity and a firm core still developing. This will be a powerful wine and one that needs to age. Drink from 2016."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine d'Arton,18.0,90.0,"This is a smooth, ripe and rounded wine with solid tannins and rich plum and berry fruits. From a good vintage, it is full of tannins, smoky wood and balanced acidity. It's a full, ripe and ready to drink."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Viña Santa Cruz,18.0,90.0,"This small-production blend of Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is deep, layered and exciting. The nose is creamy but diligent, with plum, cassis, chocolate and a touch of popcorn coming from the oak. The palate is smooth and healthy, with cassis, cherry, plum, tobacco and herb flavors in front of a bright, alert, cola-driven finish. Really good for a Chilean blend. 500 cases produced."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Reynon,18.0,90.0,"This is a finely made wine, bringing out really concentrated herbaceous flavors, almost New Zealand in their intensity. It is fresh, green, grassy, ready to drink now."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner,18.0,90.0,"The zest of grapefuit, lemon and the crunch of Granny Smith apples heralds a bright, fruity and superrefreshing wine. Midpalate texture encloses the fresh acidity beautifully and has ample liveliness and a dry finish."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Bloomer Creek,18.0,90.0,"Vin d'été means “summer wine,” and this delicate Cabernet Franc would be the perfect companion to a balmy summer eve. It's unabashedly rustic in style, with touches of leafy herbs, clay and barnyard accentuating crisp black-cherry flavors. Brisk and sprightly on the palate, it finishes long, with a murmur of velvety tannins. Unusual and a bit mysterious, yet truly lovely."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saint Clair,18.0,90.0,"Saint Clair's main Sauvignon Blanc bottling came out really well in 2013, balancing green leafy notes with grapefruit elements. It's not as big or bold as some of the Pioneer Block wines, but instead boasts a sense of firmness and a fine line of chalk and acid from start to finish."
Rosé,US,California,Scratch,18.0,90.0,"This elegant yet fun Pinot Noir-based rosé is characterized by a voluptuous body, a supple frame on which to affix the typically pleasing rosé scents and flavors of bubblegum and wild strawberry. The finish lingers, with sour apple warmth that recalls the last lick of a Jolly Rancher candy."
Chardonnay,US,California,De Loach,18.0,90.0,"There's a lot to like in this nicely priced white, a blend of several regional vineyards. A taste of hazelnut expands on the palate to meet creamy Tahitian vanilla. Approachably round, this crowd-pleasing wine finishes in measured, integrated oak."
Vermentino,US,California,Bailiwick,18.0,90.0,"Buy this for its balance and welcome sense of restraint that gives way to richness on the finish. Crisp apple and light citrus aromas, then nicely concentrated and similar flavors, put an attractive spin on this medium-bodied, fresh and appealing wine."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de l'Escarelle,18.0,90.0,"Pink fruited and light, with an attractive herbal character. The crisp acidity cuts right through the rich mouthfeel.Bright and lively, the finish has a grapefruit note that lends lift."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Südsteiermark,Strauss,18.0,90.0,"Slight notes of grass and stone fruit on the nose become more pronounced on the light but intensely flavored palate which bursts with zesty freshness and leaves the mouth bathed in green, leafy aromas forever."
Rosé,US,Washington,Waters,18.0,90.0,"A blend of co-fermented Syrah (60%) and Viognier, this wine is a very pretty pale copper color with just a tinge of salmon. It offers nuanced aromas of pear, strawberry and white flowers. The palate is dry and fresh, sleek but with depth and texture to the fruit flavors."
Malbec,Chile,Maule Valley,Altamana,18.0,90.0,"A full, loamy bouquet with minerally blackberry and cassis aromas is modern in style despite this coming from old Maule vines. A generous palate deals woody, toasty flavors of baked black plum and blackberry, while peppery spice and a hint of clove are prominent on an oak-driven finish. Drink through 2021."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Ruhlmann,18.0,90.0,"Peach and grapefruit pith, earth and lemon mix on nose and palate to create a deep-fruited wine with midpalate concentration. The body is fresh and rich and just dry, bordered and contained by that enticing grapefruit zestiness. The finish is clean."
Zinfandel,US,California,Joel Gott,18.0,90.0,"This is a full-bodied but also subtle and complex-flavored wine. The aromas bring in mild wood smoke and black-pepper notes, then the flavors add ample fruitiness without going to jamminess. The overall effect is one of sophistication."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lumos,18.0,90.0,"Organically grown grapes are vinified in all stainless steel, resulting in this fresh, delightfully textural wine. Lime, pineapple and lemon verbena flavors are backed with refreshing minerality. It's clean and crisply delicious."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Cave de Turckheim,18.0,90.0,"Ripe notions of orange and ripe apple fizz on nose and palate. This wine is fresh, dry and full of ripe citrus notes. It's an easy but wonderfully dry Riesling that spells juicy joy."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,18.0,90.0,"Juicy, appetizing apple notes rise from the glass, helped along by summer blossom and rose. The off-dry palate is generous with ripe peach and plum accented by pleasantly bitter notes of pith. The tiniest amount of spritz helps to keep things fresh."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,18.0,90.0,"A crush of mineral and earth tones exhilarate on the nose of this dry Riesling. Ripe, sunny grapefruit and nectarine flavors expand luxuriously on the palate, tightened by a fine stream of lime and lemon acidity. The finish is long and steely."
Roussanne,France,Rhône Valley,Château du Trignon,18.0,90.0,"It's unusual to find 100% Roussanne wines, but this is a terrific example at a realistic price. It's broad and mouth-coating but still seems fresh, with melon, pear and pineapple flavors that linger on the tightly focused finish. Drink over the next year or two."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Bellangelo,18.0,90.0,"A testament of Bellangelo's increasing winemaking prowess, this Cabernet Franc highlights fresh floral exuberance amidst a crush of concentrated sour cherry and cranberry flavors. While delicate in style and fringed by a whisper of tannins, its brambly, herbaceous complexities resonate through a long, meandering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Carr,18.0,90.0,"Rather than pungent green aromas, this bottling tends toward a sweeter aromatic profile, with limeade, mandarin orange and tangerine scents. On the palate, there is a slight creaminess and a nod toward bell pepper, but the tart, bitter and acidic elements of apple and lime pith combine memorably."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Collovray et Terrier,18.0,90.0,"Full of ripe, tropical fruit flavor, the wine is already generous. Apricot and mango come through the fresh acidity, giving both richness and a more textured edge. It is ready to drink, but by 2015 will be even better."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Forrest,18.0,90.0,"This is on the pungent side, boasting aromas of boxwood and white grapefruit. Try it with a ceviche or herb-steamed mussels to lessen the impact, or embrace the potent, leaf-inflected flavors on their own. Either way, savor the silky texture and crisp, vibrant finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,18.0,90.0,"Totally zesty swirls of ripe citrus sweep up green pear and yeast notes as they rise from the glass and flow across the palate. This has verve and liveliness and acts like a tonic: it's light-bodied, balanced, scented refreshment."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Stift Göttweig,18.0,90.0,"Animating, grassy, citrussy freshness sings on the nose. The palate bursts with fresh, juicy pear fruit. This is slender but full of drive and flavor. Perhaps the little angels depicted on the label helped to make this wine as light-footed and joyous as it is? It certainly will put a smile on the face of every lover of Grüner."
Rosé,US,Washington,Sleight of Hand,18.0,90.0,"Complex and finessed, this has loads of flavor. The pretty cherry and plum notes are framed with a milk chocolate accent. The modest alcohol in no way diminishes the concentration."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Norton,18.0,90.0,"Norton Reserva is one of Argentina's best Cabernetss for the money. This vintage offers a mineral aroma along with rose petal, baked plum and spiced cherry scents. It feels deep, generous and balanced, with cassis, blackberry, earth and molasses flavors."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Benvenuto de la Serna,18.0,90.0,"Jammy berry fruits, violet notes and graham cracker define the bouquet on this high-quality, good-value Malbec. The palate isn't huge but it's well structured, and the flavors are exotic and out of the ordinary, with an emphasis on Middle Eastern spice and blue-fruit flavors. On the finish, it's chocolaty and spicy but loses steam quickly."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato,18.0,90.0,"This opens with attractive floral aromas of Spanish broom, acacia and chamomile while the bright palate offers white peach, green apple and citrus. Brisk acidity gives it a crisp, clean finish while a note of white almond signals the close. Small persistent bubbles add finesse."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Hannes Reeh,18.0,90.0,"This smooth, wood-aged wine is richly tannic and packed with new wood flavors. Ripe red berries offer fruitiness and acidity. It has a fine depth of flavor and density, making it likely to age for several years, at least four. Screwcap."
Riesling,Austria,Niederösterreich,Dürnberg,18.0,90.0,"This intensely aromatic wine has perfumes of peach, apricot and ripe plum. These fruits dominate the warm, ripe palate, with just a hint of minerality."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta di Sesta,18.0,90.0,"Earthy aromas recall tilled soil, game and truffle. The dense, juicy palate delivers crushed black cherry, black pepper and clove alongside velvety tannins. It's forward and friendly; drink now for the succulent fruit flavors."
Zinfandel,US,California,Graziano,18.0,90.0,"Great balance in this fruit-forward yet well-structured wine. It's not a monster, but firmly in the lunch and dinner wine category because of appetizingly fresh raspberry and strawberry flavors and good acidity. It's medium-bodied, firm-textured and dry."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Leyda Valley,Leyda,18.0,90.0,"Snappy aromas of citrus and lime come with minerality on a bouquet that's pungent but doesn't punch. This feels clean, friendly and well built; flavors of lime, tangerine and mango finish persistent, with no breakdowns. This is what top Chilean SB is all about."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Fleur,18.0,90.0,"Chocolate, tobacco and new leather aromas make a dramatic first impression for this full-bodied and comparatively smooth wine. Then very deep dark fruit hits the palate along with smoky, peppery nuances accompanied by a just-tannic-enough texture. It will be great to drink alongside some smoked brisket."
Rosé,US,California,Draxton,18.0,90.0,"Not something easily found, this pink-orange wine is made from an unusual variety in its red form, let alone as a crisp, tart companion to picnic fare. Orange peel and strawberry are the highlights in this easygoing, lovable quaff."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium,18.0,90.0,"The intensely warm 2015 vintage goes full force in this off-dry Riesling. It's gorgeously sunny, with forward scents of guava and white peach and plump in flavors of apricot and tangerine. Approachable and easy, yet irresistibly charming."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Sonsierra,18.0,90.0,"A fresh, pure, comfortable nose with nothing pushy or out of place opens this layered, balanced Rioja that doesn't wow but definitely impresses. Plum, berry, tomato and spice flavors finish with peppery notes, staunch tannins and an overall sense of quality. Drink now through 2022."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,The Four Graces,18.0,90.0,"Flowery and textural, this is both concentrated and airy at the same time. It floats across the palate gracefully, the pretty fruit flavors of spiced pear and hints of honeydew are set up nicely by crisp, leesy acids. Good length and a fine, clean finish."
Rosé,US,Washington,Tranche,18.0,90.0,"A blend of Cinsault, Counoise and Grenache, this very pretty salmon-colored wine offers aromas of strawberry, melon, soda water and spice. It drinks dry but the fruit flavors are sweet, with tart acids finishing it off."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,I Veroni,18.0,90.0,"Sleek and fresh, this vibrant wine opens with aromas of dark berry, leafy underbrush, grilled porcini mushrooms and a whiff of tilled soil. The savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, clove, dried herb and anise alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2017."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,90.0,"Full-bodied and ripe, this is a rich, generous wine that shows complexity as well as subtle fruitiness. A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, it's full of tropical fruit flavors, with ample weight and concentration. Spicy accents, a dense texture and a fine, long-lasting finish are all part of this stylish wine."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Vignavecchia,18.0,90.0,"Luminous and fresh, this opens with aromas of red berry, violet, chopped herb and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant, linear palate offers red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and star anise alongside racy acidity and polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Buttonwood,18.0,90.0,"For an affordable, ready-to-drink bottling, this twist-top wine, which gets a touch of Sémillon, shows ripe nectarine, Pink Lady apple, lime water and grapefruit pith on the nose. The palate offers baking soda and lemon-lime flavors, along with tart apple skins and grassy notes."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Weszeli,18.0,90.0,"A rather closed nose gives way to a very light-bodied, lime-zest scented and pure palate that boasts the slightest shimmer of pepperiness and enhances its light-footed, barely-there credentials with the tiniest hint of fizz. If you like it light, clean and yet flavorful, this is for you."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Ancient Peaks,18.0,90.0,"Black pepper, black plum and blueberry show on the nose of this bottling from the nearly 900-acre vineyard atop Cuesta Grade, where it enjoys essentially its own dedicated appellation. A very full mouthfeel delivers blueberry and blackberry-paste flavors along with pencil lead, black coffee and bitter espresso. Still a tad firm in structure, this should age well and open even further in the years to come."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Kevin White,18.0,90.0,"A new offering from this young winery, this wine is mostly Syrah (54%) with the rest equal parts Grenache and Mourvèdre. Appealing aromas of high-toned herbs, smoke and fresh raspberries and blueberries lead to a medium-weight, yet silky palate, with fine concentration throughout and a finish that lingers."
Chardonnay,US,California,Folie à Deux,18.0,90.0,"Despite this wine's initial big-barrel influence, it becomes a complex, satisfying mix of salted caramel, melon and ginger that remains relatively light bodied and able to display minerality. At an attractive price, it's worth considering for midweek meals and larger gatherings."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Malescasse,18.0,90.0,"This rich wine is approaching maturity. Secondary animal aromas, dried fruit and richness are showing well, allowing this ripe wine to shine. The warm 2009 vintage comes out in the density and the dusty tannins. This is ready to drink."
Rosé,Greece,Drama,Domaine Costa Lazaridi,18.0,90.0,"Cherry and strawberry aromas lead this beautifully hued, complex rose'. The palate offers layers of herbal, blackberry and strawberry, with a brisk minerality and spicy finish adding dimension."
Muscat Blanc,Hungary,Hungary,Vinum,18.0,90.0,"Citrus, flowers and melon on the nose are mirrored in the flavors of this elegant and lively dessert wine from Hungary. The character is fresh, fruity and powerful, but not overwhelming. A lovely balance of fruit and acid gives it sophistication and a food-friendly style. Very pretty and sure to please myriad palates."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Barons V,18.0,90.0,"Matthew Loso makes excellent Sauvignon Blanc, and this is no exception. Smooth, lush and creamy, it's bursting with concentrated fruit flavors of apple, peach and papaya—definitely not a grassy style by any measure. Everything points to barrel fermentation, including the lick of fresh cream in the finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,18.0,90.0,"This superrich blend of Antão Vaz, Arinto and Roupeiro was tank fermented to keep the crispness and fruit of the blend. It is certainly rich but it has fine acidity as well—juicy and full of apple flavors. Drink the wine from 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Grange Clinet,18.0,90.0,"Rich, structured and juicy, this wine shows black fruit tones, with its firm tannins and fine acidity. It's developing into a warm, ripe wine. Drink from 2020."
Viognier,Israel,Upper Galilee,Galil Mountain,18.0,90.0,"Tannins and acidity exhibit a high level of teamwork in this smooth, mouth-pleasing wine. Aromas of lemon, white pepper and vanilla give way to flavors of lemon-lime, bergamot and vanilla custard. The finish is simultaneously lingering and bright."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Willi Haag,18.0,90.0,"This wine comes out of the bottle a little cranky, but give it some time in the glass and the initial stink gives way to notes of lime, apple and peach. It's plump in feel, with some dusty minerality and dried spices adding nuance to the sweet fruit."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Maurodos,18.0,90.0,"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Quinta da Nespereira,18.0,90.0,"A rich wine that takes time to show its structure, starting with blackberry fruits, then revealing firm, closed tannins. The wine is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, giving off power and complexity."
Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Vistalba,18.0,90.0,"Bold berry, leather and rubbery aromas show a minerally side. This is a big Malbec-driven blend with nice layering and structure. The flavor profile features reduced, roasted black-fruit flavors along with hints of herbs and leaf. The finish is generally smooth and long, with a pinch of heat. Drink through 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Errazuriz,18.0,90.0,"For South American dessert wine, this is at the top of the class. The nose is light and offers nectarine, tangerine and peach aromas, while the mouthfeel is honeyed and plump, with orange marmalade, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors. The finish is long and complex, and a touch soft in feel."
Riesling,US,Washington,Southard,18.0,90.0,"Plump and spicy, mixing mint and apple, with flavors running into riper fruits—pear and peach. This fills the mouth with luscious fruit, suggestions of vanilla cream and butterscotch, with just enough acidity to bolster it on through into the finish. It's big and thick for Riesling, yet beautifully balanced and quite delicious."
Merlot,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,18.0,90.0,"Barrel aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, cocoa and milk chocolate out in front of blackberry and black cherry. The palate also mixes fruit and barrel, showing pleasing depth of flavors and intensity along with a silky texture."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Airfield Estates,18.0,90.0,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (56%), Merlot (28%), Cabernet Franc (10%), Malbec (4%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of freshly hewn wood, cherry and herb are followed by plentiful black fruits that linger on the finish. The oak plays prominently at times but it works."
Claret,US,California,Guenoc,18.0,90.0,"This wine has has a great core of dark-fruit flavors and dark chocolate, a firmly tannic texture that makes it appetizing, and nice balance. It's a very solid dinner wine that doesn't have to be the center of attention."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,La Caña,18.0,90.0,"This pure, chiseled Albariño is light but right on the nose, with lime and stone aromas. Crisp yet comfortable, the palate delivers nectarine, apple and other familiar white-fruit flavors. A stony finish with crisp acidity and a leesy accent is lasting and attractive."
Rosé,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château de Lancyre,18.0,90.0,"Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty rosé, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close."
Red Blend,US,Oregon,Abacela,18.0,90.0,"Roughly half estate-grown Tempranillo, this smooth and deeply-fruited red includes small amounts of 10 other grapes. For all that it's complete, complex and composed, with pomegranate jam, loganberries, polished tannins and prolonged power. Drink now through 2020."
Chardonnay,US,California,Once and It's Gone,18.0,90.0,"A youthful wine still pushing out its elbows, this displays fullness and concentration at its core, an intensity of oaked spice that provides warmth on the palate. Pear, lime and lemongrass dot the landscape of complex flavor."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,David Hill,18.0,90.0,"Though 28 g/L of residual sugar is indicated, this lushly fruity and thoroughly delicious wine does not seem at all sweet, and just barely off dry. Peaches and pears combine in a lightly spicy but intensely flavorful wine with a myriad of food pairing possibilities, notably Thai noodle dishes, or poultry with a fruit sauce."
Zinfandel,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,90.0,"This big-boned wine has smoke and brown-sugar aromas, ample and delicious raspberry and blackberry flavors, firm tannins, supportive acidity and a lingering finish. While full bodied, it's well balanced and will taste great with big proteins."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner,18.0,90.0,"Rounded, friendly pleasures of ripe pear fill nose and palate, along with a pleasant and toning phenolic element and a brightening and enlivening streak of grapefruit zestiness. This goes down far too easily. Look no further for alluring, appetizing fruit."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Camp,18.0,90.0,"This screaming deal is majority varietal, with small amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. It works deliciously, thick and concentrated in cherry, cranberry and a tease of orange peel, staying crisply intriguing and amazingly light bodied on the palate. This is well worth case-stocking in one's home."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Presqu'ile,18.0,90.0,"This clean and sleek rosé comes from the Santa Maria Valley-by-way-of-Louisiana Murphy family. Watermelon candy and juice on the nose come with a touch of peach. These are followed by nice tension on the palate between strawberry fruit, bright acidity, chalk minerality, and quite a noticeable tannic grip for a pink wine."
Chardonnay,US,California,Garnet,18.0,90.0,"Plum, white peach, pineapple and mango show on the nose of this wine that is quite tropical in aromas. The palate offers yellow pear, buttered toast and salty acidity that come together in a delicious package that is affordable and widely available."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Left Coast Cellars,18.0,90.0,"This wine immediately wows the palate, bursting into full flavor with an explosion of apple and pear fruit. There's a light yeastiness as well, just enough to suggest a young, fresh, exuberant wine, and it simply grabs hold of your taste buds and never lets go."
Robola,Greece,Cephalonia,Gentilini,18.0,90.0,"This wine showcases the native Greek variety Robola beautifully, with its crisp, clean citrus aromas and flavors and minerally/sea salt spin. The wine has a fresh quality but offers layers of lemon and orange. The finish is like a spray of the sea on the palate. Pair with seafood and light salads."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Awatere Valley,Eradus,18.0,90.0,"The Awatere Valley is a cooler subsection of Marlborough, where the wines can sometimes be a bit more leafy or herbal. This wine holds true to that pattern, but balances the celery leaf and tomato stalk character with melon and fig notes. It's verging on full-bodied, even a touch oily in texture, with a long, vibrant finish."
Riesling,US,New York,Anthony Road,18.0,90.0,"Penetrating layers of white grapefruit and tangerine are laced with deliciously astringent murmurs of lime zest in this dry, citrusy Riesling. It's deeply fruity and forward, yet nuanced by savory hints of nuts and spice that linger long on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Proemio,18.0,90.0,"Leafy woody berry and graphite aromas are on the spot for Cabernet. This feels bold and saturated, with no holes in the palate. Lightly herbal flavors of plum and blackberry are darkened by a wave of chocolate, while this tastes of mocha and chocolate on a plush but energetic finish."
Merlot,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,18.0,90.0,"The aromas bring notes of milk chocolate, spice and red fruit, along with high-toned vanilla accents. The fruit and barrel flavors are plush and full, while still showing a lovely sense of balance."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Ansgar Clüsserath,18.0,90.0,"This wine's calling card is its electric acidity, which provides a poignant counterbalance to the wine's plump feel on the palate. Ripe citrus notes of pineapple and orange offer plenty of flavor to go along with the superb length. It's ready to drink, yet should prove capable of aging at least 5–6 years."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Artadi,18.0,90.0,"Fresh plum and berry aromas are the greeting, with loamy earth and dried cheese accents making an appearance on the nose. This is a bright, healthy, fruity red with plum, wild berry and a touch of oaky vanilla on the flavor profile. A chunky, chewy, plump finish with a toasty note closes it out. Drink through 2018."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Martin Ray,18.0,90.0,"A pretty bouquet of wild strawberry invites one into this wine that's faint pink in color and pleasantly awash in citrus flavor and aroma. Mellow and long-lasting on the finish, it's refreshingly crisp in acidity and light in alcohol."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Villa Maria,18.0,90.0,"Over the years, Villa Maria has been working hard on upping the quality (and the price) of its entry-level Sauvignon Blanc. No longer a Best Buy candidate, the 2008 Private Bin is still a top value, offering slightly pungent, sweaty aromas but flavors of stone fruit accented by grassy-herbal notes. There's ample weight without heaviness and a zesty, fresh finish."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Zardetto,18.0,90.0,"Elegant and fragrant, this opens with inviting scents of wisteria, jasmine and white peach. The foaming palate doles out green apple, yellow pear and citrus zest alongside tiny, persistent bubbles that give it a bright, creamy texture."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Bortolin Angelo,18.0,90.0,"Lightly scented, this offers aromas of acacia flower, nut and white orchard fruit. The focused palate offers white peach, yellow apple, ripe pear and a mineral note alongside bright acidity and a persistent, firm perlage."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Balletto,18.0,90.0,"From a Pinot Noir specialist in the heart of the Russian River Valley, this white is equal parts floral and fruity, shy and dry, with a succulent layering of lime, grapefruit and fig. A medium level of acidity wraps itself around a viscous core, keeping the wine fresh on the palate. It's the right kind of weighty, finishing with ginger and honey."
Lambrusco,Italy,Central Italy,Cavicchioli,18.0,90.0,"Refermented in the bottle, this fragrant, salmon-colored Lambrusco offers delicate scents of wild rose, dried berry and baking spice. The elegant palate offers raspberry, strawberry, nectarine zest and ginger alongside an ultrafine mousse."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Château Gaillard,18.0,90.0,"This wine is rich and full in the mouth, with swathes of ripe plum and cherry fruits. To balance that, a firm layer of tannins points up the ripe, juicy and rounded fruits of 100% Gamay. Drink this impressive wine now. It's produced by father and son, Michel and Sébastien Gutty, in Morgon."
Merlot,US,California,Pull,18.0,90.0,"Deep aromas of cherry liqueur and cedar make a very appealing nose. Cigar box and cherry juice flavors continue to the palate alongside cola nut, and there are very chewy tannins. So either serve now with a hearty cut of beef, or wait until 2015 for the grip to mellow out."
Rosé,France,Provence,Mas de Cadenet,18.0,90.0,"Crisp red apples and tight fruit skins give this wine a taut, lively character. Just a touch of caramel to broaden the acidity."
Cabernet Franc,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,18.0,90.0,"Since 1993 Arbor Crest has done this single-vineyard Cabernet Franc. As with all these wines the aromas set up the palate—scents of berry, tobacco and fresh ground coffee. In the mouth it carries on with very clean and fresh fruit, ripe and chewy/herbal tannins, excellent acid balance and a light bitter coffee finish."
Verdicchio,Italy,Central Italy,Vignamato,18.0,90.0,"Opening with an alluring fragrance of acacia flower, Spanish broom and beeswax, this boasts fleshy peach and juicy pineapple flavors, along with mineral notes and a drop of honey. It has lovely depth and should evolve more complexity over the next 2–3 years."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Oregon Territory,18.0,90.0,"As in 2014, this budget label from Paul O'Brien winery is a stunning value in an Oregon Pinot Noir. A total of 20% of the fruit was sourced from the Willamette Valley, and all was barrel aged for 10 months in 25% new French oak. Concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit is complemented with streaks of earth and bark. The texture is compelling, and the stiff tannins will continue to soften up over the next decade or so."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,18.0,90.0,"Stony mineral notes juxtapose rich honey and grapefruit flavors in this foursquare dry Riesling. It's broad and creamy on the palate yet briskly balanced with acidity. The finish is vibrant and long, accented with hints of lime and salt. Drink now through 2020."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Fattoria Ambra,18.0,90.0,"Alluring scents of bright red berry, blue flower, dark spice and a whiff of espresso float out of the glass. The bright, savory palate delivers juicy wild cherry, cassis, clove and star anise set against firm refined tannins. It's balanced, with bright acidity. A cedar note closes the finish."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bracamonte,18.0,90.0,"Gritty aromas of road tar share space on the nose with black cherry and dark plum scents. This feels hard and abrasive, even by Ribera del Duero standards. Plum, berry and integrated oak flavors finish savory and with a lasting note of dry oak. Drink through 2023."
Viura,Spain,Northern Spain,CVNE,18.0,90.0,"Nectarine and white-flower aromas are young and pulsing. This Viura feels fresh and elegant, with grip and weight. Oak-driven flavors are controlled and sit atop a white-fruit base, while this finishes clean and easy, with finesse."
Teran,Croatia,Istria,Kozlović,18.0,90.0,"Aromas include black cherry, cranberry, pomegranate, bramble and a light touch of eucalyptus. It's fruit forward and juicy on the lips yet pleasantly restrained in the midpalate. It would be an enjoyable wine at a barbecue."
Rosé,US,California,McCay Cellars,18.0,90.0,"From 100-plus-year-old Carignane vines, with splashes of Grenache, too, this is a refreshing wine for spring and summer. Stony in grapefruit and peach, it's balanced, light and dry with a fruity kick."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Criterion,18.0,90.0,"Criterion is a so-called global brand, offering Italian Pinot Grigio, Rioja and Chianti Classico among other benchmarks. This Coonawarra Cabernet is surprisingly good given that background. It offers cherry, cassis and tobacco notes, medium body and silky tannins. Drink it over the next 5–8 years."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Poggio Alloro,18.0,90.0,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this crisp, savory white opens with aromas of wildflower, stone fruit and an earthy whiff of flint. The linear, vibrant palate offers fresh peach, crunchy Granny Smith apple and a citrus note. It's balanced by tangy acidity and closes on an almond note."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stift Göttweig,18.0,90.0,"Despite the lightness of body, this lemon- and pear-scented wine offers both texture and zest. Sleek, slender refreshment, it delivers a lot of citrus zip and cleansing length."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Rocca delle Macìe,18.0,90.0,"Here is a popular winery that just keeps on producing attractive, well-priced wines. This Riserva 1998 manages to combine soft, quaffable fruit with generous, almost opulent richness. There's something brooding about the firm tannins and tarry flavors, but the fruit is just deliciously ripe."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Josef Schmid,18.0,90.0,"Slender zippiness supports fresh lemon and white pepper notes on this tight, light-footed and linear white."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Apegadas,18.0,90.0,"The wine is a field blend of a mix of grape varieties planted at random in the old Douro tradition. It is both structured and fruity, allowing a splendid range of perfumes to come from the glass. Ripe and full-bodied, with a touch of wood-aging, it has a medicinal edge as well as layers of black fruitiness. It needs to age, so drink from 2016."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Tegernseerhof,18.0,90.0,"Ripe peach mingles with a mix of phenolics and zestiness on the concentrated midpalate. Structured and spicy, it delivers peppery impact and a prolonged finish."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Nino Franco,18.0,90.0,"This luminous sparkler opens with aromas of jasmine, orange blossom and white peach. The crisp, refreshing palate doles out green apple, Bartlett pear and white almond alongside vibrant acidity and a silky mousse."
Viognier,US,Oregon,Melrose,18.0,90.0,"This new release from Melrose fills the mouth with flavor; it runs from orange blossom to Meyer lemon to candied pineapple, finally settling into a strong citrus/tropical blend of delicious fruit flavors. It seems to strike a perfect balance, staying lively and well-defined, without becoming hot or bitter."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Vista Hills,18.0,90.0,"Another fine estate-grown Pinot Gris from Vista Hills, with plenty of green apple and Bosch pear fruit, along with some light cinnamon spice. There is also a suggestion of flower in both the nose and the mouth, but overall it's a bigger wine than that, with the fruit front and center."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Thanisch,18.0,90.0,"Lavish freesia and honeysuckle perfume persists throughout this bristling, bright Riesling. It's delicate and spry in mouthfeel, but rich, round swirls of tropical fruit penetrate deeply on the palate. It's irresistably unabashedly forward and fruity."
Chardonnay,US,California,Saracina,18.0,90.0,"Fresh apple and lemon aromas and fruity but not showy flavors create a very tasty, crisp-textured and well-balanced wine. More nuances come out with each sip, like bits of apricot and lime, and the mouthfeel stays bright and nicely acidic through the finish. An unoaked wine, this includes 4% Viognier."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos,18.0,90.0,"Fermented in open stone lagares, this wine has a typical rounded, generous character, with rich dark fruit and tight acidity. Although smooth from wood aging, it has a taut edge, ultimately feeling ripe and full in the mouth. Drink now."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,I Stefanini,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of ripe Granny Smith apple and exotic fruit lead to creamy flavors of apricot, beeswax and a hint of pineapple on this delicious white. Just enough fresh acidity balances the rich flavors."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,Cantina del Castello,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of exotic fruit, white spring flower and yellow stone fruit lead the nose while the round creamy palate doles out apricot, mineral, chopped herb and nectarine. A mineral vein lifts the finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,18.0,90.0,"Principally Dundee Hills fruit, this is like a bowl of ripe pears with a dab of vanilla ice cream. It's smooth, creamy and fresh, with a broad and delicious streak of vanilla running right through the heart."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Brandborg,18.0,90.0,"This is concentrated and rich, almost oily. Dense aromas lead into a mouthfilling wine with flavors of ripe banana, Meyer lemon and candied pineapple. It's on the edge of sugary, with a slightly grainy mouthfeel, and finishes a bit off-dry."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Western Cape,Glenelly,18.0,90.0,"The aromas are promisingly thick and chewy, with assertive notes of black cherry, cigar tobacco and bittersweet chocolate. The creamy mouth delivers more of the same alongside additional elements of cassis, pepper and leathery spice. The mocha-infused finish leaves little else to be desired; drink now."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Casal Paço Padreiro,18.0,90.0,"Fragrant and fruity, this very fresh wine has a strong mineral texture. The freshness gives way to a deeper, rich sense that brings out a more creamy character. It's ripe and rich at the end."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,90.0,"Intense and crisp, it shows bright fruits and some weight as well. A touch of yellow fruits give the grapefruit a warmer character and good depth of flavor. It's a Vinho Verde for cooler days, ripe and ready for food."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Sepp Moser,18.0,90.0,"Texture and spice are the main features of this concentrated white with citrus zest on the palate. The aromatics still need to wake up; with time, they will shine. For now, grapefruit zest will suffice."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Leth,18.0,90.0,"Exuberant notes of tropical passion fruit rise from the glass in this unusually aromatic Grüner Veltliner. Citrusy freshness pervades everything, giving lively direction to the bright, slightly spritzy palate. The finish is zesty, clean and refreshing."
Chardonnay,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château Rives-Blanques,18.0,90.0,"This Chardonnay is a world-class wine available at a fraction of the cost of other excellent French examples. It boasts soft wood accents to the ripe yellow apple, pear and spiced orange tones, with zippy acidity and a mineral streak that lend freshness to the medium-weight palate. It's a layered, complex wine that will evolve well through 2022."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,90.0,"A smooth, rich wine whose fruit is ripe, full of blackberry flavors and perfumed acidity. It also has weight, concentration and a tight mineral edge that gives it extra complexity. The wine is fruity and ready to drink."
Assyrtico,Greece,Drama,Domaine Costa Lazaridi,18.0,90.0,"Brisk and bright aromas of grapefruit and lemon start this assertive and distinctive Assyrtiko. On the palate, mineral and crisp flavors are balanced by a savory spin on the backpalate. Balanced and multilayered, the wine will pair with spicy and delicate foods alike."
Merlot,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,18.0,90.0,"Deep garnet in color, this wine has a nose marked by black cherry and blackberry scents. It's soft on entry but brightens as it washes across the palate, offering blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Velvety tannins persist into the zesty, cranberry-tinged finish."
Godello,Spain,Northern Spain,Gaba do Xil,18.0,90.0,"The opening of peach, mineral, honey and wild green herbs is alluring, and the palate runs smooth and full, and also a little soft and mature. Banana, papaya and melon flavors are pretty and the finish holds its stature. Not as minerally and tight as some; this wine has sweetness and depth. Drink soon."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Ritual,18.0,90.0,"Ritual is Veramonte's top label from Casablanca and this wine is up to snuff. Grassy, green aromas of lettuce and tropical fruits set up a clean, medium-weight palate with grapefruit, gooseberry and lime flavors. A touch of bitter pyrazines rise up on the finish and dance with residual citrus notes and minerality."
Riesling,Italy,Northeastern Italy,St. Pauls,18.0,90.0,"Crisp and refreshing, it delivers honeysuckle, ripe yellow peach, pink grapefruit and lemon-lime sensations. Energizing minerality and crisp acidity give a pristine finish."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,18.0,90.0,"The terroir range of wines from Philippe Zinck is made to showcase the vineyards, in this case a chalk and clay property near Eguisheim. The wine is textured and full of tropical fruits—mangos and pineapple—along with a complex pepper and spice structure. Drink from 2016."
Zinfandel,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,90.0,A bright character comes through in this full-bodied wine. A distinctive fruit component reminiscent of strawberry and rhubarb comes with savory herbal accents that unfold on the palate and on the finish. Firm tannins and good acidity keep it balanced.
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Gaudrelle,18.0,90.0,"This is a smooth and creamy wine with soft apple flavors mingling with almonds and brisk acidity. It has a tight edge of minerality that adds a fine texture, offering a glimpse of the extra richness that can be expected in 2–3 years."
Chardonnay,New Zealand,Marlborough,Forrest Estate,18.0,90.0,"A nicely balanced barrel-aged Chard, this wine offers scents of toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and citrus, then builds on those flavors by adding broader peach notes. It's fairly full-bodied, but avoids being heavy, and boasts a long, elegant finish."
Austrian Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Gesellmann,18.0,90.0,"A wine that pairs with Gesellmann's Bela Rex Bordeaux blend. In Op (short for Opus) Eximium, Austrian grapes provide a delicious spice confection of wild fruits, expertly blended into an intense dark berry- and vanilla-flavored wine. The acidity gives a final earthy boost."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Syncline,18.0,90.0,"A mix of Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault, Mourvèdre, Counoise and Carignan, this perennial favorite is partially co-fermented and blended early; delivering unusual complexity and seamlessness at this young age. Light red fruits, leavened with brioche, dotted with pepper and toffee, create a tart, racy, juicy red wine which takes quaffable to a whole new level."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Unger,18.0,90.0,"A touch of ripe stone fruit plays amidst lighter lemon scents on the nose of this wine. The palate has an edge of pithy grapefruit, adding zesty liveliness and a pleasant bitter tone. The finish is lip-smackingly fresh, lasting and dry, making you want to sip more."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Awatere Valley,Vavasour,18.0,90.0,"Bold and pungent, defined by passion fruit and green onion, this is a medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc that packs a fruit-driven punch. White grapefruit fills in the gaps, finishing long and intense."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Boeger,18.0,90.0,"Fresh and lemony, this medium- to full-bodied wine starts out crisp and citrus-driven, growing a rounder and more substantial with each sip. The vibrant flavors and zingy acidity keep it lively through the finish."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Rheingau,Dr. Nägler,18.0,90.0,"Silky succulent raspberry and cherry flavors are a luscious counterpoint to the razor's edge of acidity that frames this impeccably balanced wine. It's ripe, fruity and forward, yet offers surprising elegance and length. Drink now through 2017."
Pinot Blanc,Germany,Pfalz,Fitz-Ritter,18.0,90.0,"While dry in style and crisply balanced, plump white peaches and apricots shine brightly in this silky Pinot Blanc. It's rich and round with a slightly clingy mouthfeel but not at all cloying or dense. Enjoy now through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Jim Barry,18.0,90.0,"Representing a good value in top-flight Cabernet, Jim Barry's 2008 The Cover Drive (a cricketing term) features subtle hints of cinnamon, coffee and vanilla layered over blueberry and plum fruit. It's on the full-bodied side, with plush, velvety tannins balanced by crisp acids. Drink now–2018."
Gewürztraminer,US,New York,Silver Thread,18.0,90.0,"Tropical mango and melon mingle elegantly into swathes of blossom and peach in this lush, juicy Gewürztraminer. It's lusciously textured, a bit brawny even, boasting creamy swirls of fruit that linger long and heavy through the finish. Drink now through 2016."
Zinfandel,US,California,Brazin,18.0,90.0,"This spicy-smelling, dry wine is well balanced, generous in flavor and a pleasure to drink.

Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, dill and blue-black fruit are bright and focused. The plum and barrel flavors show depth and a sense of texture, with lingering flavors. This wine is not typically Cabernet but it offers much appeal."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Easton,18.0,90.0,"Easton's classic Sauvignon Blanc stands out year in and year out and this is no exception. Complex in texture and flavors of lime and tropical papaya, it's marked by minerality and a pronounced crispness. It calls out to be served as an apéritif or to enjoy while cooking."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Water Wheel,18.0,90.0,"Water Wheel wines consistently deliver quality and value. The winery's 2007 Shiraz is made in a decadently supple, drink-now style with enough cocoa and mocha overtones to bring chocolate cake to mind. There's some cedar and spice complexity as well. Drink now-2013."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Poças,18.0,90.0,"From grapes grown in the Douro Superior region, this is an open delicious fruity and ripe wine that is ready to drink. Its black currant and red berry tastes are balanced by spice, wood aged flavors and a core of tannins. The aftertaste introduces fresh juicy acidity."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Lauren Ashton Cellars,18.0,90.0,"Stillwater Creek is the source of this 2012 rosé of Sangiovese, which sports a color that could easily be mistaken for Bandol. It's drinking very well, with complex flavors of strawberry and baking spices, nicely integrated."
Chenin Blanc,France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux,18.0,90.0,"Producers in Cahors are re-introducing Chenin Blanc back to its original home. That it is a happy grape in a Cahors vineyard is proved by this deliciously ripe and perfumed wine. It is full with a balance with crispness and white and yellow fruits. It could age another few months, so drink from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,Ingrid Groiss,18.0,90.0,"There is an earthy aspect to the yeasty flavors on the nose. The palate counters this with pure, streamlined lemon freshness and the very slightest of spritz. Very refreshing and wonderfully clean-cut citrus notes on a slender, zippy body."
Rosé,US,New York,Macari,18.0,90.0,"Fresh and blossomy, this elegant medium-bodied rosé offers loads of raspberry fruitiness, but also a deeply mineral spine of chalk and sea breeze. Made predominantly from Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it holds smaller proportions of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay that lend complexity and nuance."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Martinelle,18.0,90.0,"This is a lovely example of Ventoux Grenache (80%), with 15% Syrah and 5% a blend of Mourvèdre, Cinsaut and Carignan. It's slightly warm in style and supple in structure, but with hints of dried flowers and licorice to give verve and dimension to the black cherry fruit. Drink now and over the next few years."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,SuLei,18.0,90.0,"Fermented in stainless steel, then aged in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel barrels, this single-vineyard, 100% varietal Sauvignon Blanc is racy and bone dry, a true Loire Valley style. Classic varietal flavors of gooseberry, lemon/lime and slate, with a bit of spritz to liven it up."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta do Pinto,18.0,90.0,This blend includes the Rhône varietal Roussanne among the Portuguese grapes. The wine has a lightly honeyed character as well as rich yellow and stewed-pear flavors. A touch of toastiness and almonds comes through the rich fruits and acidity. Drink the wine from 2018.
Aglianico,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,90.0,"This rich-tasting and generous-feeling wine keeps everything in balance. It has mildly spicy oak aromas underlain with dark fruit, plus ample ripe berry and black-cherry flavors that broaden across the palate and linger on the finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,90.0,"An especially ripe, concentrated aroma of dark fruit carries over beautifully on the palate, where the black cherry, clove and black currant jam flavors are delicious, and the balance feels just slightly sweet. This is a big, full-bodied but smooth-textured wine."
Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,France,Loire Valley,Bouvet-Ladubay,18.0,90.0,"With its rich fruit, this is an immediately attractive wine. It shows the ripeness of the year in Saumur, bringing together apricot and cantaloupe melon flavors, the acidity a necessary and balancing adjunct to the full-bodied texture. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years."
Riesling,US,Washington,Swiftwater Cellars,18.0,90.0,"Just a hint of sweetness can be found in a bouquet of honey-dusted flower. Pretty in on the palate, with citrus and apricot notes, this shows floral accents that are somewhat reminiscent of Gewürztraminer."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Picket Fence,18.0,90.0,"Rich and thick in chocolate mocha and a punch of espresso, this wine offers great value. It showcases the cooler side of the variety in cedar undertones, while delivering decadent counterpoint with its suggestion of bacon. A lift of acidity brightens the finish."
Syrah,Chile,Maule Valley,Morandé,18.0,90.0,"A potent, dark style of Syrah, with aromas of black cherry, generous oak, leather and vanilla. Shows overdrive on the palate, with forceful tannins and concentrated flavors of blackberry, graphite, black licorice and wood resin. Fruity and long on the back end; drink now through 2013."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Girardet,18.0,90.0,"Off-dry, this succulent wine has you smacking your lips rather than puckering them. The natural acidity buoys up the sweet fruit, a mix of peach and apricot principally, and the wine has an excellent focused core that trails off into suggestions of honeycomb and lemon custard."
Rosé,France,Provence,Hecht & Bannier,18.0,90.0,"Based in Aix-en-Provence, this négociant company has sourced a beautiful wine from cool vineyards in the northern part of the Côtes de Provence region. The result is a lightly mineral wine with a crisp red-currant heart that is refreshing and good for an apéritif."
Riesling,US,New York,Anthony Nappa,18.0,90.0,"A deep, stony minerality persists from nose to finish on this light-footed Riesling. Sweetened by hints of guava and stone fruit, it's a shade off dry but endlessly refreshing. The finish lingers on a gorgeously chalky, saline note."
Lambrusco,Italy,Central Italy,Paltrinieri,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of violet, rose and woodland berry emerge on this fragrant wine. Made solely with the Sorbara grape and refermented in the bottle, the vibrant palate offers woodland berry, cherry, nectarine zest and a hint of crystallized ginger alongside firm acidity and a frothy mousse."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato,18.0,90.0,"Floral aromas of wild flowers, wisteria and a whiff of white tree fruit float out of the glass.

White Blend,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,18.0,90.0,"Full and rounded, this is a rich wine with its perfumed and smooth character from the blend of Gros Manseng and Petit Courbu. There is a more delicate element that acts as a fine contrast to the otherwise ripe wine."
Zinfandel,US,California,Easton,18.0,90.0,"Easton's largest-production Zinfandel, and earliest release, exhibits mushroomy earth tones around a core of baked plum and leathery spice. Soft and round, very accessible and ready to drink, the finish underlines those leathery jolts—the wine would be perfect with barbecue."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bucher,18.0,90.0,"Wild in barely ripe strawberry, grapefruit and a hint of mint, it hails from great ground, the Bucher Vineyard along Russian River Valley's Westside Road. A tinge of orange blossom and orange playfully intermingle on the nose and on the palate. Midweight and layered, it's a lovely wine."
Gewürztraminer,US,New York,Bellangelo,18.0,90.0,"Lusciously ripe mango and lychee aromas introduce this unusually sprightly Gewürztraminer. Perfumed and delicately sweet, but not at all cloying, it's vivacious and thirst quenching, finishing on a enticingly astringent tea-leaf note. Drink now through 2018."
Zweigelt,Austria,Thermenregion,Johanneshof Reinisch,18.0,90.0,"All the characteristic pepperiness of Zweigelt swings enticingly on nose and palate of this fresh-faced wine. This is medium bodied, fruit-driven and made incredibly appetizing by white pepper notes that pervade and complement the cherry fruit. Vibrant fruit singles this out."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Barbanau,18.0,90.0,"This delicously crisp wine is light and full of fresh citrus and red fruits. It dances out of the glass, bright with acidity. The name says it all—it's ready to drink this instant."
Shiraz,Australia,Western Australia,West Cape Howe,18.0,90.0,"Roasted meat, floral notes, peppery spice...sounds rather nice. Add in silky tannins, hints of coffee and blueberry and a long finish, and you have a pretty wine at a realistic price. Drink now-2014."
Syrah,Morocco,Zenata,Ouled Thaleb,18.0,90.0,"Deep ruby red to the eye, this red wine has a nose of cherry, pomegranate and lemon peel. It comes on bright, offering flavors of cherry, peach, eucalyptus, rose petal and pencil lead. Velvety tannins coat the palate into a finish that is a luscious mélange of cherry and orange zest with a touch of mint."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Airfield Estates,18.0,90.0,"The aromas suggest notes of herb, vanilla, wood spice, plum and dark fruit. The palate is restrained in style, full of dark-fruit and barrel flavors and lightly grainy tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Airfield Estates,18.0,90.0,"Merlot (73%) takes the lead on this wine, which is rounded out by Malbec (12%), Cabernet Sauvignon (7%), Petit Verdot (4%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of herb, barrel spice, pencil lead and red and black fruit are followed by plump yet elegant fruit flavors backed by chalky tannins. It shows a lot of restraint."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Balancing Act,18.0,90.0,Deep blue and black-fruit and spice aromas lead to a soft silky palate loaded with fruit flavors. It's a perfect example of the approachability of this vintage.
Rosé,US,New York,Channing Daughters,18.0,90.0,"Each of Channing Daughter's eight 2011 vintage rosato express a distinct personality, but the Mudd Vineyard Merlot stands out with its seamless integration of ripe, supple fruit with intense minerality and a dewy, floral flair that's irresistible, sip after sip. This is bone dry and begs to be opened as soon as possible."
Dolcetto,US,Washington,Wind Rose,18.0,90.0,"Definitely one of the better Dolcettos to emerge from Washington State, this includes both Barbera and Tempranillo in the blend. Rich, ripe aromas and flavors mix pie cherry and fresh-cut tobacco, with added layers of coffee, licorice and dark chocolate. A feast for the senses."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Seven Hills,18.0,90.0,"A super value, the 2009 Planing Mill Red is an eight-grape blend that nonetheless shows lovely integration of fruit, subtle aromatics, and a seamless progression of well-balanced flavors. Notes of cherry, chocolate and buttered toast come into play, all done in an elegant and most appealing fashion."
Merlot,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,18.0,90.0,"This pure Merlot is made from fruit that was sourced from Bacchus, Conner Lee, Dionysus and Klipsun vineyards.

It's a great introduction to this winery and its talent for creating Rhône-inspired wines."
Zinfandel,US,Washington,Thurston Wolfe,18.0,90.0,"Thurston Wolfe pioneered Zinfandel in Washington. This is the seventh vintage from the Zephyr Ridge vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, vinified to California-style alcohol levels of 15.5%. A fruit bomb to be sure, but along with jammy raspberries and strawberries you'll find interesting nuances of pencil lead, oak and chocolate."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Quivira,18.0,90.0,"This is a lively, impressive and fresh white wine with salty, stony minerality and a well-developed texture. Fig, citrus zest and white peach flavors figure into its winning profile."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,New York,Ravines,18.0,90.0,"Ripe, succulent peach and melon flavors mark this dry but lusciously textured Sauvignon Blanc.

Zinfandel,US,California,Milliaire,18.0,90.0,"Lovely nose, with coconut and hazelnut scents augmenting the cherry/berry fruit. Not an ordinairy set of scents and flavors, but enticing and distinctive. The fruit is intense and perfumed, and the accents of coconut seem just right."
Zinfandel,US,California,Alderbrook,18.0,90.0,"Delicious berries and cream nose, which follows through with crisp, spicy flavors and good structure. OVOC stands for “old vines old clones” and the fruit, from head-pruned, hillside vineyards, lives up to its billing. Great all-purpose Zin."
Chardonnay,US,California,Paul Dolan,18.0,90.0,"Rich and multi-layered, the wine smells like lemon and cream, while tastes recall marzipan, lemon and pear. It feels luxurious in texture and has a tasty, lingering finish. While full bodied, it doesn't get as heavy as the flavors might suggest and shows good balance."
Rosé,US,California,Sol Rouge,18.0,90.0,"An extroverted burst of meaty, minerally and fruity flavors defines this medium-bodied, firm-textured and concentrated wine. Imagine prosciutto wrapped around canteloupe for the flavor, plus vivid acidity and a lingering, almost smoky finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,18.0,90.0,"The producer stays true to its roots with this deliciously made white, a blend of mostly Sauvignon Blanc with some Sauvignon Gris and Sauvignon Musqué. Waxy apple comes first, followed by fully etched acidity that manifests itself as fresh-cut lemon and tangerine. A 100% stainless-steel wine, it finishes refreshingly."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sobon Estate,18.0,90.0,"Rich, spicy aromas and flavors of black cherry and cedar make this full-bodied wine from one of the longest-running wineries in California's Sierra Foothills hard to resist. It has a feeling of breadth and depth on the palate alongside lush layers of tasty fruit."
Baga,Portugal,Bairrada,Global Wines,18.0,90.0,"A bold, ripe, perfumed wine with Baga tannins and acidity, this is not a wine for easy drinking—demanding rich, oily or fatty foods instead. It's a great example of this notoriously fickle grape and is packed with spicy fruit. Drink from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Lava Cap,18.0,90.0,"Light herb aromas and vivid apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine delicious, while the tangy, nervy texture keeps the mouth tingling. It has great balance, concentration and length on the finish."
Nero d'Avola,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Judeka,18.0,90.0,"Alluring scents of pressed violet, perfumed berry and a whiff of cake spice lead the nose. The bright, chewy palate doles out layers of ripe black cherry, blackberry, raspberry, chopped mint and a sprinkling of cocoa. Soft, round tannins support the juicy flavors. There's not much complexity but it is mouthwateringly delicious. Drink through 2017."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Les Trouvés,18.0,90.0,"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this wine offers restrained aromas of spice, almond and flowers. The palate shows a good sense of texture and tension as well as length."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Casa Ferreirinha,18.0,90.0,"A finely made wine that is smooth and ripe. With a mix of citrus. melon and tropical fruits, it is balanced, touched by light wood aging, and feels rich while also elegant. The wine can be drunk in the next year, giving a delicious fruity character."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Vista Hills,18.0,90.0,"Ripe, round and fleshy, this brings generous tree fruits annotated with bright spices. It's clean, fresh and has a hint of mint in the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Leonard Kreusch,18.0,90.0,"Musky floral, spice and cherry-blossom notes meld in the exuberant bouquet of this aromatic auslese.

Friulano,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tenuta La Ponca,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of nut, apple skin, pear and chopped sage lead the nose while the fresh, inviting palate shows citrus zest, yellow apple and crystallized ginger. A blast of tangerine and a mineral note back up the finish."
Godello,Spain,Northern Spain,Avancia,18.0,90.0,"Melony floral aromas are friendly and easygoing. On the palate, this is clean and precise, with moderate weight and a touch of oak. Lime and kiwi flavors are a bit sweet, with a welcome oaky offset. On the finish, this Godello fades nicely, with core acidity extending the ride."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Vigna di Pettineo,18.0,90.0,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this offers enticing aromas of juicy black fruit, spiced blueberry, graphite and violet. The round, savory palate delivers layers of ripe dark cherry, white pepper and mineral alongside firm but polished tannins."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Domaine Cauhapé,18.0,90.0,"Harvested at the end of October, this gently sweet wine has hints of botrytis along with ripe apricot and honey flavors. It is shot through with delicious acidity that gives the wine a great lift and final freshness."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Porca de Murça,18.0,90.0,"This is a rounded and ripe wine, with generous black fruits and a full, fruity texture. It shows balanced acidity, hints of wood and a fine integration of fruit and tannins. It can be enjoyed now, but will be better from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Apex,18.0,90.0,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this 100% varietal wine is bright and focused with notes of herbs, citrus and kiwi. It's ripe and full of juicy fruit flavors with a spine of citric acidity running throughout. Give this some time to open up."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Cuvaison,18.0,90.0,"With an alluring bouquet of fresh-cut jasmine and citrus, this is a light, vibrant wine, bristling in acidity that's fruity and briny in equal measure.

It dances in acidity, remaining bright and fresh on the palate throughout."

Garganega,Italy,Veneto,Gini,18.0,90.0,"Vibrant and savory, this polished white offers scents of perfumed white flower and ripe orchard fruit.

Shiraz,Israel,Galilee,Tabor,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of blackberry, black pepper and a whiff of jalapeño get your palate ready for rich flavors of blackberry, tart cherry, black olive and mocha.

Turbiana,Italy,Lombardy,Tenuta Roveglia,18.0,90.0,"Scents of citrus blossom, honeysuckle and white stone fruit delicately lead the way on this vibrant white. The bright refreshing palate offers Bartlett pear, creamy white peach and a hint of tangerine."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Alvarez de Toledo,18.0,90.0,"Ripe plum and violet aromas carry a slight note of prune. A beefy palate shows hard tannins but nothing too tough that food can't tame.

Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Alma de Cattleya,18.0,90.0,"Crisp pear skins, kaffir lime, dewy oregano and underripe honeydew show on the nose of this sprightly bottling.

Moscato,Italy,Piedmont,Braida di Giacomo Bologna,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of yellow stone fruit and chopped Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this fragrant sparkler. The frothy palate doles out juicy yellow peach, mature apricot, thyme and a hint of candied tangerine zest alongside fresh acidity."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,18.0,90.0,"With minty wood flavors, this wine is smooth and polished. It offers berry fruits from the blend of 10 varieties in this old-vine vineyard. With spice and some firm tannins in the background, it is ready to drink."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Casal da Coelheira,18.0,90.0,"This is a successful blend of Chardonnay and Arinto that blends a creamy texture with crisp fruit flavors. Wood aged, the wine has a toasty edge that fills out the fruit and gives spice to the citrus and apple flavors. The wine is still young; give it until late 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lanbersac,18.0,90.0,"This is a firm yet ripe wine that boasts ripe black-plum flavors layered with dense and dusty tannins. The wine is concentrated, with wood aging filling out the structure. It is big and bold, finishing with great ripe fruit."
Zweigelt,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Anita und Hans,18.0,90.0,"2015's ripe red cherry fruit is presented here in a compact, taut, and concentrated package of freshness and verve. It has lovely pepper spice and ample freshness, giving focus to its lovely, crunchy, fresh cherry fruit."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,18.0,90.0,"This is a fully structured, Alicante Bouschet-dominated wine from the Redondo region in the heart of Alentejo. Its juicy black fruit is firmly anchored by tannins and acidity. Concentrated and still likely to age, it will be best from 2018."
Carignan,Chile,Maule Valley,TerraNoble,18.0,90.0,"Violet in color, this Maule Carignan smells toasty and oaky, like maple and campfire. In the mouth, this is resiny but also flush and acidic. Woody upfront flavors are backed by racy plum and blackberry notes, while this tastes oaky but feels juicy and zesty on the finish. Drink through 2023."
Godello,Spain,Galicia,Adega Algueira,18.0,90.0,Peach and nectarine aromas come with a dusty covering. This Godello feels both round and pulpy but also balanced and well cut by acidity. Dry almost briny white-fruit flavors are stony and suggest nectarine on the finish. Drink now.
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Marlborough,Dashwood,18.0,90.0,"This wine leans more toward the earthy, savory side of Pinot Noir, yet still boasts enough plum and black cherry fruit to please most consumers. It's medium bodied, with a velvety or suede-like texture and hints of root vegetables, mushrooms, sassafras and cola. Ready to drink."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière,18.0,90.0,"This entry-level wine of the Saint André de Figuière range is pretty impressive in itself. It has a rounded, smooth character that is lifted by attractive red berry acidity and a nervy, mineral texture. Balanced acidity completes the picture."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Marsan,18.0,90.0,"While this wine has obviously seen plenty of wood aging, it's also full of dark blackberry fruit. Together, those qualities give density and structure, with acidity and fruitiness to match. Drink from 2021."
Red Blend,US,Oregon,RoxyAnn,18.0,90.0,"Made from 75% Syrah with the rest Malbec and a smidgeon of Cabernet Sauvignon, it brings notes of dried cherry, vanilla and barrel spices. The palate is luscious and rich with abundant cherry flavors and barrel accents leading to a cranberry-filled finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château de Brigue,18.0,90.0,This is a finely balanced wine. It is dry with its red fruit right to the fore. The acidity and the tangy texture both promise some further aging. This is a great food-style rosé that will be good to drink from late 2017.
Syrah,US,Washington,Saviah,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of blue fruit, green herb, funk and savory notes lead to sweet, luscious blue-fruit and smoked-meat flavors that linger effortlessly on the finish. The sense of balance and length are rare for a wine at this price."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Ramon Ramos,18.0,90.0,"Ripe dense aromas of blackberry and cassis border on prune and raisin but pull back. A compact saturated palate is held together by hard, pounding tannins, while grapy black-fruit flavors show a chocolaty note of fudge. A condensed tannic finish is heavy and feels a bit overextracted."
Rosé,US,New York,Sheldrake Point,18.0,90.0,"One of this vintage's prettiest rosé wines from the Finger Lakes, this perfumed, full-bodied sip offers loads of cherry-blossom and raspberry exuberance. Ripe red-cherry and watermelon flavors are a few shades sweeter on the palate than most, but it's zesty and pert on the palate."
Primitivo,US,California,Uvaggio,18.0,90.0,"If only more California Primitivo could be made in this style - soft, lower in alcohol, modestly showing its fruit - there would be more converts among Zin fanatics, who would be wowed by the subtle black cherry and licorice flavors and dry finish, minimally aged in oak."
Viognier,US,California,Helwig,18.0,90.0,"Beautiful fruit flavors and a lively texture make a memorable impression in this medium-bodied, richly layered but also crisp and balanced wine. It tastes like sliced Pippin apples and Bosc pears, with pinches of vanilla and nutmeg."
White Blend,US,California,Vinum,18.0,90.0,"Rich and full bodied but not sweet, this fruity-floral wine blends vanilla and pistachio flavors with ripe pear and apricot. It has nice flavor complexity, a soothing texture and lingering finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,The Divining Rod,18.0,90.0,"A project of Marc Mondavi, this wine is a blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, rounded out by tiny percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Merlot. Juicy in dark cherry and blackberry fruit, it is well composed, with a smoky undercurrent."
Gros Manseng,France,Southwest France,Lapeyre,18.0,90.0,"Made from the Gros Manseng grape, this pineapple and mango flavored wine is dry, but so fruity. The acidity just floats in the mouth, while the slight fruit-skin texture adds an edge to a wine that's delicious."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château de la Ragotiere,18.0,90.0,"Rich, full-bodied, a Muscadet that brings together crisp green fruits, intense minerality and concentration. There's a great tang of lime and pink grapefruit, smoothed out with ripe, creamy apple. Age maybe for a year."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Owen Roe,18.0,90.0,"The '06 displays bright and crisp flavors of currant and cherry. Tannins are substantial, with a satisfying earthy streak underscoring notes of graphite and olive. It's not a big wine, but it delivers a pleasing mix of New World fruit and Old World earthiness."
Saperavi,Georgia,Kakheti,Marani,18.0,90.0,"Deep red-violet in color, this wine has a bouquet of raspberry, strawberry and lavender. It is complex but eminently pleasing on the palate, with chewy tannins and flavors of blackberry, leather, smoke, chocolate and coffee and a soft touch of iodine on the tenacious finish."
Saperavi-Merlot,Georgia,Kakheti,Marani,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of black cherry, anise and violet lay the groundwork for flavors of dark berries, smoke and leather with touches of violet. Tannins are firm, but vigorous berry flavors maintain dominance into a soft smoky finish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sierra Starr,18.0,90.0,"Lightly spicy aromas and rich, soothing fruit flavors make this an attractive, lovable and classically proportioned wine. Cherry and raspberry flavors rest on a lightly tannic but smooth texture, and linger on the finish."
Syrah,Australia,South Australia,Sidewood,18.0,90.0,"A concentrated, intense wine, filled with cherry-berry fruit and more than a hint of vanilla. It's tart and edgy, with some firm tannins on the finish, so hold it another 12 months and then drink it over the next 5–6 years."
Sémillon,France,Bordeaux,Clos des Justices,18.0,90.0,"This smooth, rich wine is young but already creamy. It has plenty of acidity woven into its lemon and pear fruitiness, accented with hints of honey. It comes from vines planted in 1929 in Preignac, within the Sauternes appellation, but is a dry Bordeaux Blanc."
Red Blend,Italy,Veneto,Masi,18.0,90.0,"You'll find alluring scents of iris, blackberry and nutmeg on this blend of 70% Corvina, 25% Rondinella and 5% Molinara. The savory palate delivers ripe plum, black cherry, carob and a touch of licorice alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2022."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Churchill's,18.0,90.0,"This is a structured and dense wine. It has a fine contrast between the ripe red fruits, the mineral tannins and acidity. From the company's vineyards, the wine is balanced and worth aging. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Brande,18.0,90.0,"Anne-Marie and Jean-Guy Todeschini started a revolution here and at Château Mangot and sons Karl and Yann (mid-Millennials) are moving it on. They use Jean-Pierre Cousinié's terroir analysis (look it up), no pesticides, experiment with no sulfur and are changing the way their terroir talks to the wine. This vintage is a rich wine with attractive black currant fruit and fine acidity. With structured tannins and light spice, it is fruity, juicy and will be ready to drink from 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,August Kesseler,18.0,90.0,"Deeply concentrated, with honeyed yellow-peach and tangerine flavors, this is a gorgeously composed wine, with just a hint of sweetness for balance. Notes of cherry blossom and crushed minerals add complexity and depth. It finishes long, with a delicate, lacy sweetness."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Erste Neue,18.0,90.0,"This medium-bodied and elegant Pinot Bianco boasts fragrances of white spring flowers, green apple and flint that carry over to the savory palate. The juicy fruit is supported by fresh acidity that leaves a clean crisp finish, making this extremely food friendly. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines."
Albariño,US,Oregon,Abacela,18.0,90.0,"From estate-grown fruit, this fresh, lightly frizzante, insanely crisp white wine brings all the tang and salt of the real deal from Spain. What marks it as New World is the fruit concentration, a dense thicket of midpalate citrus—lemon, lime and lots of grapefruit."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Laurent Gauthier,18.0,90.0,"Ripe, densely structured wine, balancing tannins, acidity and red plum and cherry fruit flavors. There's a strong mineral edge here, a wine that needs 2–3 years of aging, to round out its edges."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Pontoise Cabarrus,18.0,90.0,"From vineyards close to Saint-Estèphe, this wine has something of the dark tannins and dry character when young. Ripe fruit under the chocolate, coffee and new-wood flavors shows the potential for aging. Drink from 2018."
Riesling,US,New York,Bloomer Creek,18.0,90.0,"Buoyantly aromatic with notes of fresh wildflowers, preserved apricots and honey, this dry Riesling made from a tiny single-vineyard crop balances elegant crushed stone and stonefruit flavors with a focused acidity and stark orange peel astringency. Balanced and elegantly structured, it finishes on a long, meandering orange inflected note."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Jim Barry,18.0,90.0,"Wet stone and lemon-lime. If those sound good to you, this ageworthy Riesling is a fit for you. It's medium in body yet very crisp and linear in structure, with a hint of citrus pith on the finish. Drink 2015–2020."
Sauvignon Blanc,Australia,South Australia,Groom,18.0,90.0,"Daryl Groom has turned out a reasonably bold, intense Sauvignon Blanc that weighs in under 13% alcohol yet manages to avoid tasting malnourished or underripe. Fig, melon and citrus aromas and flavors hit the right buttons, then finish on a lingering note. Drink now."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Robertson,De Wetshof,18.0,90.0,"This is a Chardonnay that showcases the best of what South Africa can offer: fresh fruit, elegant minerality, good value. The nose of citrus and flowers is both flirty and sophisticated, and the palate is friendly but complex, with mingling fruit and spice. Everything about the wine makes an impression  from start to finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaines Landron,18.0,90.0,"The partly volcanic nature of amphibolite soil gives this wine a natural ripe fruitiness. Apple skin and fresh Rocha pears convey a fruit-forward character, bright and crisp. It's a young wine, although it can be drunk now for its exuberant outward-looking character."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,Gini,18.0,90.0,"Crisp and linear, this delicious Soave delivers sensations of honeysuckle, tart green apple, creamy white peach and juicy nectarine. It's vibrant and balanced, with bright acidity."
Muscat,US,Oregon,Abacela,18.0,90.0,"This is definitely sweet, with 30 g/L residual sugar, but that is counterbalanced with enough natural acidity to keep it lively and just outside the dessert wine category. The aromatics show plenty of Muscat's lush orange blossom and fruit character, with a concentrated palate and penetrating finish."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Caves Aliança,18.0,90.0,"Close to the Serra da Estrela, Portugal's highest mountain range, the Quinta da Garrida shows all the structure of Dão wines. This is a firmly mineral wine, very textured with a hint of the oak aging as well as more open yellow fruits. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Selaks,18.0,90.0,"The combination of leafiness and pink grapefruit on the nose suggests red currants, while the flavors on the palate are more tropical in nature. Still, crisp citrus carries the day, giving vibrancy to this medium-bodied wine."
Riesling,US,New York,Anthony Nappa,18.0,90.0,"Seductive floral notes of violet and lavender persist throughout this juicy revitalizing Riesling. It's elegantly off dry, balancing honey-tangerine and pineapple sweetness against crisp lime and lemon acidity. The finish is pleasantly persistent."
Mauzac,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Domaines Paul Mas,18.0,90.0,"At only 7.5% alcohol, this is remarkably light and easy to drink, with vibrant notes of fresh peach, honeysuckle, baked apple and sweet, ripe pear, all balanced by ample acidity and brisk carbonation. The sweet fruit flavors are coupled with a lingering toasty richness on the finish. Versatile and friendly, this is an ideal apéritif or after-dinner drink."
Rosé,US,Washington,Upsidedown,18.0,90.0,"This wine is a rare example of Nebbiolo in the state. A pretty pale peach, almost bronze color, it brings aromas of mineral and strawberry. The tart flavors drink bone dry with medium-bodied cherry notes that draw out on the finish."
Vermentino,US,California,Uvaggio,18.0,90.0,"Herbaceous aromas and bright citrus flavors give an almost-electric charge to this light-bodied, crisp and appetizing wine. Aromas of snap peas, parsley and fresh-cut grass lead to lemon and grapefruit flavors and a tingly mouthfeel. It's a perfect summer-to-fall drink."
Riesling,US,Washington,Sparkman,18.0,90.0,"This wine is a blend of fruit from the Bacchus (57%), Dionysus (22%) and Olsen (21%) vineyards. The aromas are vibrant, with notes of lime zest, white peach, apple and mineral, along with whiffs of reduction. It drinks dry, with a sleek high-acid styling. Stone-fruit flavors linger on the finish. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Weingut Liebfrauenstift,18.0,90.0,"Ripe, heady tropical fruit and citrus aromas extend onto the palate of this dry, yet deeply fruity, concentrated Riesling. It's unabashedly juicy, but textured and mineral on the palate, finishing long and with a streak of high-toned acidity."
Pinot Grigio,Italy,Northeastern Italy,St. Pauls,18.0,90.0,"This full-bodied wine is loaded with sensations of fragrant white flowers, ripe tropical fruit, juicy yellow peach and tart green apple. The creamy palate is brightened by fresh acidity and energizing mineral notes. It's well balanced, with more depth than most other Pinot Grigios."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,18.0,90.0,"Yes, it is spicy, but this is also an elegant wine, balancing its honeyed sweetness and tropical fruits with a stylish acidity and sophisticated perfume. Warm and round at the end, it is ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Durant,18.0,90.0,"You'll note the bubbles around the edges of the glass, some remaining CO2 that says “drink me, I'm fresh!” It puts a creamy edge on this fruitbowl of a Pinot Gris, with abundant green and yellow fruits and a slight impression of residual sugar. But what stands out are the flavors of ripe, juicy, just-picked pears. Credit winemaker Jesse Lange."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Thomas Fogarty,18.0,90.0,"Though the aromas of orange and apple blossom, honey and peach extract feign a touch of sweetness, this wine's steely minerality belies such a conclusion. And so does the palate, where a lemonade acidity and wet slate element cut clean through fresh apples and pear flesh, revealing that it's not sweet at all."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Winzer Krems,18.0,90.0,"One tightly packed parcel of citrus zest and white pepper, this is streamlined, compact and linear, making it a moreish refresher. It's light-footed nature makes it very easy to drink. Ideal for hot days where real refreshment is needed."
Syrah,US,California,People's Wine Revolution,18.0,90.0,"Definitively taking a cool-climate approach, this 100% varietal wine opens with indelible wafts of violets and white pepper, followed by a presence of more pepper and black currant around a medium-sized body. Earthy leather and mushroom pronounce themselves on the midpalate before it finishes in black licorice."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Criss Cross,18.0,90.0,"This full-bodied and complex wine has loads of personality. An exotic, slightly earthy aroma leads to fruity richness and good viscosity on the palate, with a creamy texture and wonderful sense of layering."
Traminer,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Pojer & Sandri,18.0,90.0,"A rich, spicy wine, full of intense fruit, produced by Mario Pojer and Fiorentino Sandri. They conjure ripeness and balance from the Traminer, giving it power but also food-friendly subtlety."
Auxerrois,US,Oregon,Björnson,18.0,90.0,"This unusual Alsatian grape is a featured white wine at Adelsheim, and Björnson does a fine job as well. One-fifth was fermented in wood, the rest in stainless. It's fleshy and round, with a core of slightly candied tropical fruit. Smooth and engaging, it lingers in a graceful finish laced with streaks of caramel."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Couly-Dutheil,18.0,90.0,"There is some richness here, a wine that has sweet plum and spice flavors followed by a toasty character. The fruit has some stalkiness, while the acidity is very present. Could age well."
Rkatsiteli,Georgia,Kakheti,Pheasant's Tears,18.0,90.0,"Aromatic, with notes of black tea leaves, sandalwood and incense, this smoky Georgian amber wine boasts delicate orange rind and blossom flavors, swathed in bristling, chestnut-skin-like tannins. There's a wonderful textural richness attributable to the wine's prolonged maceration in traditional Georgian qvevri."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Lake Chalice,18.0,90.0,"Struck flint, fig and melon aromas lead the way, followed by similar flavors, plus a strong backbone of mixed citrus. It's pleasantly light in weight, with a long, crisp, citrusy finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tour Saint-Vincent,18.0,90.0,"A rich and smooth wine, this is packed with black fruits that are touched with smoky tannins from the wood aging. It's full, fruity and structured on the palate. It will age over at least 5–6 years, but, with its rich texture, it will be drinkable soon."
Syrah,US,Washington,Purple Star,18.0,90.0,"Aromas of berry, coffee, herbs and smoke lead to dark fruit flavors with a layered, supple feel. It's a good find at this price."
Teroldego,US,California,Terra d'Oro,18.0,90.0,"This is a dark, almost thick, velvet-textured wine with plenty of tannin and flavors of blackberry and black pepper. While mouthcoating in texture, its not overly full in body, and will pair well with cheesy pastas and rich meat braises."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Quinta de Paços,18.0,90.0,"With its green-fruit aromas and ripe citrus flavors, this is a wine that moves generously from cool and crisp to rich and full. Its citrus is balanced by white peach and green-plum flavors. The finish adds an orange-zest tang that is both refreshing and gives a tight texture. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,Germany,Rheingau,Carl Ehrhard,18.0,90.0,"Rose petals and violet perfume this fragrant, voluptuously textured Spätburgunder. It's ripe and approachable but structured by fine, firm tannins and sprightly acidity. Luscious streaks of blackberry and cherry nectar linger on the finish."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Gadais Père et Fils,18.0,90.0,"As dense as Muscadet gets, this is a full, concentrated wine in its white fruit flavors. Its broad, rounded character is pierced by lemon and lime acidity. Age for six months."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Taron,18.0,90.0,"Initial aromas of animal fur and cheesy oak give way to balsamic berry fruit scents. While this is mature on the palate, it's balanced and displaying vital acidic kick. Earthy plum and berry flavors finish with modest oak, spice and cocoa notes. This is ready to drink but not at the end of its road."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,18.0,90.0,"Vineyards on the western slopes of the Serra da Estrela, Portugal's highest mountain range, give this fine expression of the local star white grape. With a creamy texture, apricot and citrus fruits and a tangy lemon zest texture, this is a delicious, balanced wine, ready to drink now."
Tokay,Australia,Victoria,Campbells,18.0,90.0,"For a fortified wine with a light amber hue, this is wonderfully fresh and citrusy, with aromas and flavors of marmalade and bergamot. Honeyed, toffee-like notes add depth, with the richness of the wine brought home by the slightly viscous finish. Even Campbells' entry level Tokay is special, offering hints of bergamot, honey and mushroom on the nose, followed by honey and gentle citrus-marmalade flavors. It's full and plush, long and a just a little warm on the finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Barnard Griffin,17.0,90.0,"The variety is unmistakable, with notes of dried herb, dark cherry and espresso. The jammy fruit flavors are rich, with lightly grainy tannins and coffee notes on the finish. It shows a fine sense of balance."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Mayne Vieil,17.0,90.0,"With ripe Merlot dominating this fine, blackberry flavored wine, it is fruity and rich. The acidity gives a crisper edge to the wine while the tannins come from a dry core. It is a wine in progress, full of potential and likely to be ready to drink from 2018."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Château d'Or et de Gueules,17.0,90.0,"Dense almost to the point of chewiness, this is a concentrated blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Earthy, plummy notes pick up hints of dark chocolate and licorice before ending rich and velvety."
Riesling,US,New York,Keuka Spring,17.0,90.0,"Peach and blossom notes abound on this delightfully fresh fruity wine. Its sunny stone-fruit flavors are concentrated and juicy, balanced against zesty lime acidity and a meandering pollen finish. Sprightly in texture yet buoyant."
Rosé,US,California,La Clarine Farm,17.0,90.0,"La Clarine Farm's rosé is slightly cloudy, sourced mostly from Syrah grapes, with unusual additions of Mourvèdre, Sémillon and Viognier. Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine. Light at 12.8% alcohol, it's an intriguing melange of earthy dark strawberry and mint, crisp in acidity."
Syrah,US,Washington,Barnard Griffin,17.0,90.0,"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, this is a classic example of Wahluke Slope Syrah.

It's ready to drink, and should be consumed over the next 3–4 years."
Bonarda,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,17.0,90.0,"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic.

Sparkling Blend,France,Loire Valley,Bouvet-Ladubay,17.0,90.0,"A full and rich wine, it is packed with pepper and spice flavors as well as the crispest apple fruits. A young wine that could age, it is still tight and mineral although showing a fragrant character."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Fitz-Ritter,17.0,90.0,"While the nose is austere, suggesting more stone than fruit, the palate of this dry-style Riesling offers loads of juicy, sunny peach and apricot flavors.

Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Cottanera,17.0,90.0,"Vibrant and elegant, this offers aromas of wild flower and ripe red berry. The juicy palate doles out tart red cherry, fresh strawberry and mineral alongside tangy acidity. A mouthwatering saline note closes the bright finish."

Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,J. Scott Cellars,17.0,90.0,"Pinot Blanc is both under-produced and under-valued, yet delivers exceptional flavor and a distinctive profile, especially in the better vintages, such as 2013.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,UDACA,17.0,90.0,"The Sé (cathedral) on the label of this wine is in Viseu, the granite-built capital of the Dão region.

Savatiano,Greece,Retsina,Papagiannakos,17.0,90.0,"This restina balances traditional flavor with a modern refinement. On the nose, subdued herbal/pine notes with a spry citrus edge.

Riesling,US,Washington,Savage Grace,17.0,90.0,"An immediately appealing wine with notes of freshly cut apple, apricot, mineral and jasmine. Though it has 17 g/L residual sugar, it drinks barely off dry with the vineyard's electric acidity more than balancing out the midpalate's sugar, providing a dry feel to the drawn-out finish. Equal parts phenolic feel and flavor, put it on the dinner table now to see it at its best."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Chocolate Box,17.0,90.0,"Lush and appealing, this is one of the more appropriately named of the Chocolate Box wines. Slightly jammy raspberry fruit is coated in chocolate; even the tannins come across as softly dusty, even vaguely cocoa-like. Drink over the next year or two."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes,17.0,90.0,"Whether it's the biodynamic vineyard or the ripeness of the fruit, this is certainly a rich, full-bodied wine. It's fruity and forward, although it's structure and minerality lendimpressive character. The aftertaste is fruity, fresh and bone dry."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Douro,Douro Prime,17.0,90.0,"This rich wine still shows its wood-aging character. It has firm tannins, dark fruit and concentration. From vineyards in the Douro Superior, this wine should be drunk from 2018."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Balestri Valda,17.0,90.0,"Aromas of pressed honeysuckle and orchard fruit lead the nose while the vibrant savory palate doles out ripe peach, yellow apple and a hint of lemon zest. An almond note lends a pleasantly bitter finish."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Waterbrook,17.0,90.0,"The aromas of toast, pear, pineapple and spice are nuanced and reserved. Flavors are light, focused and textured, displaying both varietal and winemaker intent."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Marqués de Vizhoja,17.0,90.0,"Apple and citrusy aromas of lemon and lime are pure and clean. This feels crisp and citric, with zesty, tangy lime and tangerine flavors. In general, this is a simply presented Albariño, but one with class and clarity."
Syrah,France,France Other,Château Routas,17.0,90.0,"While earthy on the nose, the palate bursts with huge berry flavors on this powerful wine. Bold, ripe fruit is cushioned by tannins and penetrating acidity, lending a dark feel to its structure. Drink from 2015."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,17.0,90.0,"Although labeled as Sec (dry), this wine has hallmarks of the sweeter wines from this estate. Through its crisp, dry texture come honey, almonds and a light hint of botrytis. It makes for a delicious wine that is likely to age well, although hard to resist now. Drink ideally from 2018."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Türk,17.0,90.0,"Fresh, even vigorous pear and lemon zest notes make a promising opening. The palate is light but has a concentrated, almost fizzing core of peppery, citrussy freshness and delivers lots of verve. This is a collaborative effort between a German star chef and an Austrian winemaker to celebrate this variety's endless versatility with imaginative cooking. I think they've done themselves justice."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine des Pasquiers,17.0,90.0,"Certified organic by Ecocert, this estate straddles the communes of Sablet, Plan de Dieu and Gigondas. This entry-level blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is beautifully floral and herbal, yet backed by appealing red and purple fruit. Medium to full in body, it's firm but ripe, framed by dusty tannins. Drink now–2020."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Val do Sosego,17.0,90.0,"Apple and stone fruit aromas are fresh and direct, not wayward, leesy or creamy. This is a layered, somewhat complex Albariño, with fresh flavors of lemon curd and white peach. A dry, classy, wet stone finish is elegant and emphasizes the positives of the variety."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Domaine Robert Klingenfus,17.0,90.0,Perfumed notes of honeysuckle and rose hit the nose immediately. The palate is similarly scented but also has juicy ripe peach fruit. The richness is countered by subtle orange peel zestiness. This is full of rounded aromatic florals and fruit. The finish is off dry.
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Castera,17.0,90.0,"The wine comes from a selection of parcels on the Castera estate. With a majority (60%) of Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is structured and firm and still developing. It has red-berry and black-currant fruit along with plenty of tannic structure. Drink the wine from 2020."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,17.0,90.0,"The 2011 vintage is a high-water mark for the Indian Wells Chardonnay, principally because the oaky, buttered popcorn flavors have been muted. It's a firm, slightly tart mix of green and yellow fruits, with supporting acids and excellent length. Pleasantly toasty, but not over the top."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Beau Joubert,17.0,90.0,"Integrated, elegant flavors characterize this full-bodied Cab from premium producer Beau Joubert. Mocha and blackberry on the nose and palate, paired with soft, smooth tannins, create layers of flavor that linger. A wine with dimension and class."
Chardonnay,US,California,Navarro,17.0,90.0,"In the past, the winery made a Mendocino appellation Chardonnay from a mix of Anderson Valley and Potter Valley fruit. But in 2010, all of the fruit is sourced from the Anderson Valley. This is fleshy, soft and lush, bearing grapefruit and fig flavors that are wrapped in a tightly focused package with a bright finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Signé Vigneron,17.0,90.0,"This is big Fleurie, dominated by floral aromas and dry tannins at this stage, and therefore likely to develop for a year or two. The fruits are dark plum, full in the mouth. The acidity offers freshness but also adds to the weight of the texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Brutocao,17.0,90.0,"This wine's flinty, mineral aroma gives way to lively citrus flavors, great acidity and smooth texture that carry into the finish. It's subtle and medium bodied, with very good balance and enough complexity to hold interest."
Zinfandel,US,California,ZinPhomaniac,17.0,90.0,"Fueled by loads of fresh fruit flavor, this is a full-bodied and generous-tasting wine. Tempting cedar and pine aromas lead to raspberry, cherry and blackberry notes that are almost sweet and last long on the finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,New York,Keuka Spring,17.0,90.0,"Rose-petal perfume and pink-grapefruit notes lend a classic nobility to this delicately off-dry Gewürztraminer. It's bold in alcohol but balanced, juxtaposing voluptuous, mouth-filling texture against bright citrusy acidity. Fresh and floral, it finishes long with a lingering tea-tannin astringency."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,17.0,90.0,"Charming overtones of citrus herald the freshness of the 2014 vintage, while the palate shows richer fruit: golden Mirabelle plums and baked apricot with occasional swirls of rose blossom. The dry finish beautifully accentuates the freshness and is rather moreish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Wakefield,17.0,90.0,"Taylors (exported under the Wakefield Estate label) is a top-notch source for Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2004 boasts a big nose of cassis, mint or eucalyptus and a touch of roasted peppers. It's mouthfilling, with plenty of soft tannins, then finishes with more cassis and a hint of coffee."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,South Australia,Earthworks,17.0,90.0,"This Cabernet is built for current consumption, boasting a savory, complex blend of meat and herb elements nicely balanced by just enough dark plum fruit. The tannins are soft to the point of creaminess, letting just a bit of warmth show through on the lingering finish. Drink now–2016."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Jurtschitsch,17.0,90.0,Savory yeastiness joins lemon zestiness and draws a peppery line from start to finish on this refreshing but lightweight wine. Flavors make you want to keep sipping to get to the bottom of these spicy nuances.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Steininger,17.0,90.0,"Zippy, fresh conference pear fruit with just a little edge of white pepper and zingy lemon zest plays on this linear, light-bodied but ultrafresh wine. An almost-weightless lightness means that the wine will do well as an enlivening apéritif."
Merlot,Israel,Upper Galilee,Recanati,17.0,90.0,"Inky red-violet in the glass, this wine has aromas of black cherry and chocolate. It is pleasing on the palate, with fruit-dominated flavors of cherry, raspberry, pomegranate, vanilla and espresso. Smooth soft tannins linger a moment past a finish marked by a splash of cranberry with a touch of freshly ground coffee."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tenuta Cà Bolani,17.0,90.0,"Delicate and refined fragrances convey passion fruit, white flower and an herbal note. The palate offers creamy white peach, green melon, nectarine and a light mineral vein alongside bright acidity. This wine is well balanced and loaded with finesse."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Dupré,17.0,90.0,"From vines planted in the Tour Bourdon plot in 1940, this concentrated wine is ripe and rich while still shot through with red-currant acidity. Its tannins come from the low-yielding vines, giving a firm edge. The aftertaste is all about fresher red fruits. Jean-Michel Dupré is a member of Terroirs Originels—17 producers on the hills of Beaujolais and Burgundy's Mâcon."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Three Rivers,17.0,90.0,"Named to reflect the unoaked style, with no malolactic fermentation, this hits the mark with good concentration and bright, snappy green apple, kiwi and cucumber flavors. There's a pleasing push through the palate from the juicy acidity, and the finish remains focused and on point."
Rosé,US,New York,Wölffer,17.0,90.0,"Hints of bramble accent bright raspberry and peach scents on this refreshingly dry rosé. Juicy and fresh on the palate, it balances intense cherry and wild strawberry flavors with a brisk, brash acidity that drives a long finish."
Chardonnay,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,17.0,90.0,"Subtle notes of toasted grain frame citrus and peach fruit in this well-priced offering. It's not the biggest, most robust Chardonnay, but it delivers intensity allied to length, turning lemony on the powerful finish. Drink now–2020."
Grenache,US,California,Babcock,17.0,90.0,"Every vintage Bryan Babcock makes an experimental white wine pressed straight from red grapes, in this case opting for Grenache. The result is a unique nose of lemon cake, pink rose petals and ice cream, followed by a a lively, energetic palate powered by Key lime pie flavors. It's worth tracking down for those seeking something completely different."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Lucien Lardy,17.0,90.0,"This ripe and rounded wine features soft tannins and generous fruitiness. Cherries dominate along with juicy plums, all cut by acidity. An edge of tannins give weight and a concentrated feel. Drink now, but even better wait until 2015."
Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Gabriel Meffre,17.0,90.0,"Meffre's Laurus range includes a number of interesting wines, like this Côtes du Rhione white, a blend of 51% Viognier, 29% Roussanne, 14% Grenache Blanc and 4% Bourboulenc. It's perfumed and floral yet full bodied and richly textured, with apricot and ginger notes enhanced by hints of cinnamon and clove from time in barrel. Drink now."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Lucien Albrecht,17.0,90.0,"A restrained nose slowly gives way to the mellow fruit of ripe yellow apple. This is deeply apparent on the balanced palate where slightly creamy mousse fills the senses with that apple scent. This is balanced and has a lovely backdrop of brioche-like autolytic flavors. The finish is fresh, lemony and dry."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,17.0,90.0,"Impeccably fresh, vivid and textural, this appealing wine brings a mix of orange peel, pink grapefruit and pear fruit. There's a pleasing touch of spice, and all but 5% was stainless-steel fermented."
Riesling,US,New York,Keuka Spring,17.0,90.0,"While bountiful in ripe, plush nectarine, peach and melon, this medium-sweet Riesling off sets its sunny side with dazzling acidity. Light on its feet yet deeply penetrating, it's an effortless people pleaser offering balance and satisfaction."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Companhia das Quintas,17.0,90.0,"Big, bold and ripe, it has concentrated fruit flavors that give black plum juice and acidity, while the tannins still show strength and power. The blend of Syrah, Alicante Bouschet and Aragonez is coming together richly and with density. It needs to age, so don't drink before 2016."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Nessa,17.0,90.0,"Dusty apple aromas are given lift courtesy of citrus notes. This feels good on the palate, with zesty acidity. Flavors of stone fruits, tropical fruits, apple and citrus meld together well, while the finish is pure and long."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,17.0,90.0,"Creamy, herbal freshness shines in this wine, recalling yeast and sage, lemon zest and aloe vera.

Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine du Clos du Fief,17.0,90.0,"The Tête family is well known in Beaujolais both as vineyard owners and as wine merchants. This wine comes from a family-owned vineyard close to Juliénas. It is fruity and ripe with a rich texture and warm tannins. Perfumed and with fine acidity, it is ready to drink."

Badenhorst Family Wines,17.0,90.0,"A complex blend of 75% Shiraz, 10% Cinsault, 8% Cab Sauv, 6% Gren and 1% each of Carignan and Mourvèdre, this is a concentrated and flavorful selection that's brimming with raspberry sauce and dark berry fruit aromas and flavors. Framed by black tea, sweet spice and vanilla bean accents, the mouth is firmly structured with medium tannins and acidity, ending on a soft, roasty note."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de l'Ecu,17.0,90.0,"This is the entry-level wine from this biodynamic estate. It is full of flavor, ripe from the lees aging and with intense acidity to balance. It goes more to the apple side of Muscadet, producing a wine that is rich and full bodied. Drink from late 2017."
Friulano,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Petrucco,17.0,90.0,"Unusual but enticing, it opens with aromas of smoke, mineral and stone fruit. The savory palate offers yellow peach, golden apple and Bartlett pear accented with notes of clove, nut and nutmeg. It's linear and well-balanced. George Wines, Zancanella."
Tinta Roriz,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Portal,17.0,90.0,"Tinta Roriz (in Spanish Tempranillo) is recognized in the Douro as a great table wine grape, and this big-hearted wine is good proof. It is surprisingly elegant for its weight and alcohol, a smoothness coming from wood aging. The fruits are black cherry and black plum skin, with tannins showing a tight, mineral edge. For aging."

Gewürztraminer,US,New York,Dr. Konstantin Frank,17.0,90.0,"Bold lychee, honeydew and stone-fruit perfume adorns this varietally classic Gewürztraminer.

Drink now through 2020."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Substance,17.0,90.0,"This 100% varietal wine from Goose Ridge and Frenchman Hills vineyards provides immediate appeal, with fresh aromas of blackberry, black currant and licorice. The flavors are full and don't hold back, with firm lightly grainy tannins providing support. It still needs some time to stretch it legs. Give it an hour decant or wait until after 2017."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Water Wheel,17.0,90.0,"Water Wheel's 2005 Shiraz is a full-bodied, creamy-textured effort filled with the scents and flavors of dark plums, vanilla and coffee. It's delicious now, but should evolve through 2020, thanks to its concentrated fruit and ample tannins."

Riesling,New Zealand,Nelson,Seifried,17.0,90.0,"Light in weight, delicate in style, this is just barely off dry. Crisp apple fruit carries hints of riper stone fruit (nectarine?) but is underlain by a distinctly stony note. The lingering finish ably balances tart and sweet."

Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Sophenia,17.0,90.0,"This muscular Malbec opens with a blast of ripe berry aromas offset by oaky coconut notes. A plump palate avoids being pudgy, while plum, black cherry and blackberry flavors end with a turn of oaky vanilla and balancing residual acidity."
Mencía,Spain,Galicia,Don Bernardino,17.0,90.0,"Earthy plum and cherry aromas score points for being clear and direct. The palate on this varietal Mencía is round, smooth and just right. Lightly briny, earthy plum and cherry flavors hold steady on the finish, with a dash of saltiness."

Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,17.0,90.0,"A wine that brings out so many facets of Chenin Blanc. It is rich and lightly honeyed, yet dry and rounded. Almonds and apple acidity are enhanced by black currant dustiness to give a wine that should age for several years."
Pinot Noir,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Trinity Hill,17.0,90.0,"Hawke's Bay isn't known for Pinot Noir, but this wine shows that it can be done, given proper site selection.

Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Liberated,17.0,90.0,"This is a new line of label-driven wine meant to be adventurous and whimsical.

Tangy, it's both tart and tropical, finishing focused and lean."
Red Blend,Chile,Cachapoal Valley,Anakena,17.0,90.0,"Aromas of licorice, nutmeg and blackberry come with herbal, leafy notes. This feels plump, with integrated acidity and a good texture.

Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Kees Kieren,17.0,90.0,"Persistent lines of smoke, petrol and crushed slate hint to the maturity of this dry, elegantly framed Riesling. The palate is racy and tart, balancing crisp white peach and lemon notes with a mineral-oil slick that elongates and intensifies the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Esporão,17.0,90.0,"Still young and showing fresh fruitiness, this wine needs time to calm down and broaden out. Made of four classic varieties in the Esporão vineyard, it's dense, stalky and still full of tannins. Give this wine until 2016."

Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Mar de Viñas,17.0,90.0,"Fresh apple and nectarine aromas are clean and appealing. This is round, lifted and correct in terms of mouthfeel. Fleshy nectarine and apple flavors finish minerally, a touch briny and long. Drink now."

The plush texture and structured yet approachable tannins make this a wine that can be enjoyed now–2018."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Monmousseau,17.0,90.0,The tell-tale touch of honey so typical of Chenin Blanc gives this wine its creamy character. That contrasts with the tight apple texture and nutty character that add complexity to this delicious wine. It is rounded and soft while having the freshest aftertaste.
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,17.0,90.0,"Jasmine and honey notes are intensely aromatic on this dry, elegantly framed Riesling.

Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner,17.0,90.0,"An aromatic hint of pine mixes with the red cherry notes on the nose, creating a very appetizing opening. The ultralight palate is translucent and slender, with the same leafy conifer aromas and lots and lots of red currant brightness and freshness.

Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Waipara,Rubus,17.0,90.0,"This is on the green side, but not overdone, offering grassy, herbal aromas and a touch of citrus fruit. Attractive cut grass and lime notes mark the medium-bodied palate and extend through the finish. Drink now."

Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Perelada,17.0,90.0,"Rich dark-berry aromas combined with toasty oak give this seven-grape blend a modern yet encouraging nose. Saturated but slightly tannic and grating in feel, this tastes of blackened toast, vanilla, blackberry and spices. Toasty black-fruit flavors are largely pure on a tannic finish. Drink through 2022."
White Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Fernández Gómez,17.0,90.0,"Peach and apricot aromas give way to vanilla and resiny oak notes. This blend of Viura, Malvasia and Garnacha Blanca is full in body and has taken well to oak. Melon, green banana and wood spice flavors are dry and elegant on the finish. Drink through 2021."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Wakefield,17.0,90.0,"This offers the vinous elements of fruit cocktail, combining hints of peach, pear and citrus in the glass. That fruit mélange tightens up on the finish, reined in by an extra squirt of mouthwatering lime."
Syrah,Morocco,Zenata,Ouled Thaleb,17.0,90.0,"From the first whiff of cherry, cranberry and caramel you know you are in for a treat.

Albariño,Spain,Galicia,As Laxas,17.0,90.0,"A little yellow in color and fuller with its aromas, Laxas delivers chunky but pleasant apple, melon and orange scents that come with pine-needle accents.

Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Estremadura,DFJ Vinhos,17.0,90.0,"Firm and ripe, with dense, juicy fruit, this shows the exuberant side of Touriga Nacional. It has solid tannins, but the fruit is full of bright berries, herbs and a touch of pepper. The wood aging has rounded the fruit out."

The juicy palate delivers white peach, pear, banana, papaya and almond alongside bright acidity that leaves a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now through 2016."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Carabella,17.0,90.0,"Carabella's tasty, toasty take on Pinot Gris is a blend of two clones, mostly fermented in stainless steel, but with a third of it fermented in neutral oak. The resulting wine is elegant and complex, a mix of white peach and pear, toasted hazelnuts and butterscotch. Simply delicious."
White Blend,Georgia,Kakheti,Kindzmarauli Marani,17.0,90.0,"This amber-colored wine has a perfumed nose of apricot marmalade and marzipan. It is bright on entry, followed by a sophisticated sense of chalkiness with intense flavors of peach, nectarine, brioche, guava and honeysuckle. Flashes of brightness on the finish dissipate the firm tannins on the palate."
Pinot Noir,Australia,South Australia,Wakefield,17.0,90.0,"Based in Clare Valley, Wakefield sources this fruit from the cooler Adelaide Hills. Attractive rose-petal and dry earth aromas lead the way, followed by notes of black cherries and licorice on the palate. It's a bit full-bodied and muscular, a Pinot more for steak than salmon."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Les Vignerons de Tavel,17.0,90.0,"A slightly confected cherry note on the nose is balanced by hints of crushed stone in this medium-bodied rosé. On the palate, cherries blend with citrus and peppery spice, then finish with mouthwatering flavors and refreshing acidity. Drink now."
Saperavi,Georgia,Kakheti,Teliani Valley,17.0,90.0,"Appearing deeply ruby-red to the eye, this semi-sweet wine offers aromas of black cherry, freshly ground black pepper and vanilla bean.

Smooth tannins and a hint of mint make for a pleasing finish."
Chardonnay,Canada,British Columbia,Nk'Mip Cellars,17.0,90.0,"This solidly fruity wine comes with a generous application of toasty, buttery oak flavors. About 40% was barrel fermented, the rest done in stainless steel. Fleshy peach fruit is awash in buttery caramel and toffee flavors."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Fiegl,17.0,90.0,"Intense aromas of tomato vine, chopped mint, basil and sage lead the nose. The savory, linear palate presents citrus zest, yellow stone fruit, aromatic herb and mineral alongside vibrant acidity that leaves a tangy finish."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,D'Arenberg,17.0,90.0,"Unlike most Australian Rieslings, this one is a bit sweet (off dry, really). Hints of honey and bergamot bring complexity to the ripe, peachy flavors of this muscular wine, finishing with a dusty, tactile sensation. Drink now-2025."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Schloss Vollrads,17.0,90.0,Whiffs of struck flint and slate lend minerality to this light-footed dry Riesling. It's an electric wine powered by jolts of lemon-lime acidity but juicy white grapefruit and peach flavors round out the midpalate. Drink now through 2020.

The bright, linear palate doles out black cherry, ripe plum, white pepper and clove while polished tannins and fresh acidity provide the lithe, easy-drinking framework. There's not much complexity but it will makes fine drinking over the next few years."

Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Carabella,17.0,90.0,"This elegant and detailed Pinot Gris offers fresh floral accents around spicy, toasty, well-mixed fruit. Pear and orange fruit flavors carry just a slight hint of honey, and the concentrated finish extends into a long, clean fade-out."

Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Mascota,17.0,90.0,"Crisp, minerally cherry aromas come with a complex note of desert herbs. This feels totally fresh and full, basically just right. Nicely oaked, ripe flavors of plum and berry fruits are chocolaty, dry and spicy on the finish."
Tinta de Toro,Spain,Northern Spain,Teso La Monja,17.0,90.0,"Teso la Monja picked a good vintage to introduce this entry-level Toro.

On the palate, spunky berry fruit flavors blend with juniper notes, while the finish delivers herbal leftovers, a pinch more juniper and commendable length and smoothness."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,The Eyrie Vineyards,17.0,90.0,"Distinctive aromas of beeswax and bee pollen continue with similar flavors, wrapped around tart yellow apple fruit. It's lovely, fragrant and ageworthy, in a high-acid Euro mold, but give it plenty of time to breathe. Decanting is a good idea."
Riesling,Germany,Landwein Rhein,Peter Jakob Kühn,17.0,90.0,"Tones of mineral and steel hold center stage in this steely dry Riesling. Lemon and lime flavors bristle on the palate, but the finish is polished smooth, honed by a cool mineral touch that lengthens the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Christopher,17.0,90.0,"Purity and precision abound in this exceptionally light-footed sweet Riesling.

Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Van Ruiten,17.0,90.0,"Loads of ripe fruit flavor, scads of fine-grained tannins for texture, and a sense of depth with complexity make this a wine to seek out. It's full bodied, dry, very bold but also well balanced for the long haul. Drink after 2019."
Riesling,US,New York,Shaw,17.0,90.0,"This late-release Riesling is texturally fascinating with a rich, minerally palate bursting with white grapefruit and waxy, floral flavors.

Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier,17.0,90.0,"Plump, clingy peach and honey notes are cut with streaks of lime in this delicate yet intensely satisfying wine. Off dry in style, it's refreshingly juicy, with a rich, supple mouthfeel offset by bristling acidity."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Viñedos Real Rubio,17.0,90.0,"Lightly baked berry aromas vie for attention with leather, spice and mild earth notes, and the result is disjointed. On the palate, this is tight as a drum initially, but more expansive as it unfolds. Cherry, plum, raspberry, vanilla and woodspice flavors finish pure, clean and easy. This is a fine yet manageable Rioja that's not trying too hard. Drink through 2016."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine St Pierre,16.0,90.0,"Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender.

Silvaner,Germany,Franken,Castell,16.0,90.0,"White blossom perfume accents notes of fresh lemon, lime and green melon in this aromatic Silvaner.

Mouth filling and rich in texture, it clings lusciously through a long finish."
Sylvaner,France,Alsace,Domaine Roland Schmitt,16.0,90.0,"Bruised apple and dandelion notes play spicily on the textured, slightly phenolic palate. The central streak of freshness brightens all aspects of the wine, which might gain complexity with a year or two more in bottle. For now it remains intriguingly poised between earthy richness and ethereal lift."
White Blend,Hungary,Tokaji,Chateau Dereszla,16.0,90.0,"This delicate Hungarian white wine is a blend of 86% Furmint, 9% Yellow Muscat and 5% Kabar. It has enticing aromas of white flowers, botrytis, gardenia, apple blossom and apricot that prepare your palate for flavors of peach juice, citrus zest, grapefruit juice, caramelized pineapple and a crisp clean finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lange,16.0,90.0,"Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,16.0,90.0,"Complex, mineral wine, crisp but also very, very textured. Flavors of peach and red apples work with pink grapefruit to give the fruit character, while there is also a more serious complexity of green herbs. The finish is soft, still mineral. Screwcap."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Niederösterreich,Pratsch,16.0,90.0,"Soft notes of green bell pepper, nettle and grass give this a fresh aspect. The slender palate then adds lemon, giving a focused zestiness, with glimpses of boxwood. The wine is citric, slender and very refreshing."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Delgado Zuleta,16.0,90.0,"Intense, nutty, yeasty aromas are briny and a touch creamy. This has a tight, pure, round palate with salty nectarine, apricot and nut flavors. Walnut oil and white pepper notes grace a direct, lively finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Durigutti,16.0,90.0,"With oak-based aromas of Graham cracker, vanilla and baked berries, this comes across as being ripe and generous. Baked black fruits, ample oak, mocha and vanilla are the key flavors, while the finish is woody and medium long. Drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Peter Nicolay,16.0,90.0,"Textbook entry-level Riesling, tightly coiled and medium-bodied, with lovely tension between sweet green-apple fruit notes, minerally hints of crushed stone and zesty acids that recall pink grapefruit. Drink now."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Cantina del Castello,16.0,90.0,"Linear and vibrant, this opens with an enticing fragrance of hawthorn and black locust. The juicy palate offers creamy white peach, tart green apple and citrus alongside an energizing mineral vein. It's well balanced, with zesty acidity."
Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Montespina,16.0,90.0,"Fresh apple and lime aromas are pure as can be. This is chiseled, crisp and crystalline in the mouth, with lime, grapefruit and other citrus flavors. A long, firm, flavorful finish brings a slight hint of citrus  pith the longer it runs out."
Riesling,US,New York,Sheldrake Point,16.0,90.0,"Yellow peaches, waxy white florals and honeysuckle perfume this intensely aromatic wine. Floral notes persist on the palate as well, but are elegantly balanced with soft mineral tones and an invigorating lime acidity. Distinctly elegant, it finishes with a lingering hint of tea leaves."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Gadais Père et Fils,16.0,90.0,"This is a finely textured wine, shining with the granite soil of the vineyard. Its acidity and crisp apple flavors are still young, still tight. Give this delicious wine until late 2017 to drink."

Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Chatard,16.0,90.0,"Rich and spicy, this 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from 10 acres generous and ripe, with warm tannins and a fruity, red berry character. This blend has attractive acidity and spicy flavors from the combination of wood and stainless-steel aging. This is only the second vintage from enologist Jean-Rémi Larrat's own property. It is worth aging, so drink from 2017."
Moscatel,Portugal,Moscatel de Setúbal,José Maria da Fonseca,16.0,90.0,"This is a wine that reveals the younger side of Moscatel in Setúbal. It shows honey, spice and perfumed fruitiness that contrast with the richness of the texture and its fresh peach and apricot flavors. Drink now for immediate enjoyment."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,José Maria da Fonseca,16.0,90.0,"This is a finely integrated, rich wine that shows impeccable balance between dusty tannins and juicy dark berry tones. The wood aging shows through in a smooth texture that gives a sense of richness to the ripe fruit. This is an elegant wine that can be drunk now although it will benefit from some aging. Drink from 2017."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Imperiales,16.0,90.0,"Power and precision are accounted for on a deep, minerally nose that's loaded with cassis and blackberry aromas.

Aged six months in oak; drink through 2016."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Coutinel,16.0,90.0,"This flowery, perfumed wine is full of red currants and berries that balance a solid, dry element. With the potential of rounding out and becoming rich as well as structured, it should be cellared. Drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz,16.0,90.0,"Rich, but structured and balanced, this is a wine that has delicious swathes of ripe blackberry and black plum. There is a touch of bitter extract, but this will integrate as the wine ages. The acidity goes well with the solid tannins. Drink from 2016."
Malbec,France,France Other,Château de Gaudou,16.0,90.0,"This dry white wine, made from red Malbec grapes is intensely aromatic with quince, almond and lychee notes. It's a fascinating combination that has produced a rare style of wine. Although it is dry, its perfumed character brings out ripeness on the palate."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,16.0,90.0,"Aged for 12 months in wood, this smooth, ripe wine is already rich and delicious. Its structure is well integrated into the berry fruits and acidity. It's ready to drink from 2018."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Ronco dei Tassi,16.0,90.0,"Savory and bright, this has classic varietal aromas of grapefruit, tropical fruit and an herbaceous note reminiscent of crushed tomato vine. The vibrant palate delivers green melon, kiwi and dried herb alongside tangy acidity and a hint of stony mineral."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Carnuntum,Netzl,16.0,90.0,"Grapefruit spiciness and a touch of yeast show on the nose of this wine. The palate revolves around zesty grapefruit flavors, its concentration and juiciness leading to a tingling, refreshing finish that's wonderfully clean."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Brandborg,16.0,90.0,"A bracing, tart Riesling, quite dry and still under 13% alcohol, this mixes green apples, fresh citrus, pineapple and unusual suggestions of clove and spice.

Glera,Italy,Veneto,Mongarda,16.0,90.0,"Fragrant and refined, this elegant sparkler offers enticing scents of hawthorn, wild flower and sliced pear. The vibrant balanced palate doles out citrus, crisp apple and a hint of ginger set against firm acidity and a soft, foaming mousse. It has clean dry finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Herdade da Comporta,16.0,90.0,"On the Atlantic coast, south of Lisbon, the Herdade da Comporta style is rich, soft wines, generous in their warm tannins. The 2007 shows ripe fruit, figs, chocolate and plum flavors and dense texture."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,16.0,90.0,"A wine created to celebrate 100 years of Madiran as a designated region, this is a solid, chunky, proper expression of Tannat. The tannins mold easily into the rich black berry fruits, a wine piled high with complex flavors."
Riesling,US,Washington,Nodland,16.0,90.0,"Here's a good, clean effort, not showing entirely bone dry but enough for the moniker. Mixed citrus, notably lime, green apple and spicy notes dominate, in a wine with excellent balance and a welcome touch of minerality."
Rosé,US,New York,Kelby James Russell,16.0,90.0,"Refreshingly mineral, yet deeply concentrated in red fruit, this wine is a standout amidst a growing contingent of quality New York rosé. It's revitalizing in acidity and nuanced, showcasing hints of bramble against a backdrop of deep cherry and berry flavors. Dry, elegant and quaffable, it's an ideal summer staple."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Girard,16.0,90.0,"This wine packs a punch of flavor for the price, and is made in large enough quantities to find easily. Vibrant in lemon, lime and mandarin orange, it's smooth, refreshing and delicious."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de Vaugondy,16.0,90.0,"This ripe, complex wine offers a delicate combination of apple, lemon and honey, with a mineral texture. Balanced already although likely to age well, it is full of fruit, with a more steely texture at the end. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be better to wait until 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Schloss Saarstein,16.0,90.0,"Whiffs of smoke and struck flint persist from nose to finish, lending dramatic minerality to this otherwise juicy, fruity Riesling.

Rosé,US,Washington,Tranche,16.0,90.0,"Now sourced from the estate vineyard on Red Mountain, this exceptional rosé includes portions of Counoise, Cinsault and Grenache.

Pinot Gris,US,New York,Sheldrake Point,16.0,90.0,"Pretty honeysuckle and freesia notes lend a blossomy feel to this supple, impeccably balanced wine. Tart white peach, quince and pineapple flavors are juicy yet bracing on the palate. It ends briskly with a shower of crushed minerals."
Mavrud,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Edoardo Miroglio,16.0,90.0,"This wine has aromas of cherry, cherry pie, pomegranate juice and dark chocolate.

Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Casale Daviddi,16.0,90.0,"Delightful and delicious, this opens with aromas of violet, red berry, cake spice and an earthy whiff of moist soil. The polished palate offers juicy red cherry, crushed strawberry, orange peel and cinnamon while bright acidity and silky tannins provide balance."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stadt Krems,16.0,90.0,"Lime zest and green pear peel on the nose turn into fuller, zestier flavor on the palate. Leafy pepperiness joins the fresh conference pear fruit and makes for a lovely, if very light, texture. The wine is an accomplishment for such a difficult vintage."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Palacio,16.0,90.0,"Dry earth, baked berry, tobacco and vanilla aromas are harmonious and true to Rioja. A forceful palate with rubbery tannins features savory oak, raspberry and plum flavors, while the finish tastes saucy and shows intensity."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Concannon,16.0,90.0,"This is complex, delicious, bold and tannic, bringing the big structure that is expected without being heavy handed. It offers concentrated blackberry and fig aromas, richly jammy flavors that stay dry and a tannic but not tough texture."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château de Corbiac,16.0,90.0,"There is an excellent depth of flavor in this ripe and fruity wine. It is more about rich fruits than it is about structure, giving a full and rounded character to the plum-jelly, spice and mint flavors. Ready to drink in a year."
Tempranillo Blend,US,California,Lee Family Farm,16.0,90.0,"A beautiful, bargain-priced blend of Tinta Roriz (aka Tempranillo), Touriga Nacional, Touriga Francesa and Alvarelhão. Violet and jasmine perfumed, this wine is so, so pretty with just a stunning nose. In taste, there's raspberry, strawberry and lilting layers of pepper and herbs. An intriguing wine well worth trying, made by Morgan Winery Winegrower Dan Lee."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine le Renard,16.0,90.0,"The blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah mixes notes of black cherries with hints of red raspberries to create a delicious tension. Dried spices and mocha add nuance, while the tannins are firm at first, fading to the texture of cocoa powder on the long finish. Drink now–2022."
Rosé,France,Provence,Provence Wine Maker,16.0,90.0,This wine comes from vines south of the Mont Sainte-Victoire and close to the edge of the Aix-en-Provence region. The cool vineyard site helps the wine keep extreme freshness. Plenty of wild strawberry flavors are lifted by acidity and a refreshing citrus edge.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Landhaus Mayer,16.0,90.0,"Citric force creates a pleasant vortex of green pear on this easy, zippy and full-fruited summer wine. Finishes with a lip-smacking fillip of bracing, lemony freshness. Almost like sherbet."
Red Blend,Chile,Central Valley,MontGras,16.0,90.0,"Priced just above the Best Buy level, Quatro is still a great value. MontGras brings Cabernet, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah together in a well-meshed way. The wine is big and full of blackberry fruit. It has some woody characteristics, but mostly it's harmonious as it builds to a nice finish of mocha and fine tannins."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Marlargo,16.0,90.0,"Marlargo appears to be a reasonably successful attempt at fashioning a pan-Australian brand, sourcing fruit from different parts of the country. This Clare Riesling starts with scents of talcum powder and lime sherbet, then follows those up with similar flavors. It's muscular and taut, even a bit austere, clocking in at only 11.4% alcohol. May develop through 2015."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade de Medeiros,16.0,90.0,"This is a big, bold, fruity wine, typical of the powerful reds of Alentejano. It has ripe tannins, concentrated dark fruits and juicy final acidity. With a blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, it's made to age, and this full-bodied wine should be kept until 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Jax,16.0,90.0,"Knowing only time in stainless steel, this light, clear white is zingy in grapefruit, wet stone and melon, its texture and body crisp and focused. The price for this quality is hard to beat."
White Blend,US,California,Terra d'Oro,16.0,90.0,"This is an elegant, intricate wine that's fresh and lively while layered with attractive green apple, white pepper and thyme flavors. Light bodied, it makes a great apéritif or pairing with fish and fowl."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sextant,16.0,90.0,"This is an excellent wine for the price. Aromas of lightly salted nectarines and pan-seared Asian pear are very inviting and pretty. There's a nice sizzle of acidity on the palate and a nervy tension, with lime juice and sea-salt sharpness leading into rounded almond and apple notes in the midpalate."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Tilleuls,16.0,90.0,"This is a ripe wine, maybe no longer a fresh Muscadet, but certainly a rich one. It has kept some fruitiness while gaining a smooth and creamy character along with intense acidity. It is ready to drink now."
Riesling,US,Washington,Hogue,16.0,90.0,"Hogue's Genesis bottling is far more limited than the winery's other Rieslings, and offers extra dimensions in terms of concentration and grip. Though just 12.6% alcohol, it tastes dry enough, with juicy acidity and green apple flavors. What elevates it above the less expensive bottling is its length, the minerality and the hints of white flower, Mandarin orange and stone."
Syrah,US,Washington,Purple Star,16.0,90.0,"Made from fruit that was sourced from Olsen Vineyards, this Syrah's blackberry, cherry and pepper flavors and fine-grained tannins combine to make a wine with good length and a clean finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Filoco,16.0,90.0,"A lightly wood aged wine, deliciously fresh and creamy, hinting at smooth Chardonnay-like textures. A light perfume from Malvasia adds piquancy to this attractive, textured wine."
Moscato,US,California,Noceto,16.0,90.0,"Like taking in a fresh bouquet of flowers just in bloom, this deliciously crafted Moscato Frivolo, slightly fizzy and superlatively refreshing, is a lovely surprise at just 7% alcohol and $16. Start your night off with a glass or let it guide you through a meal, serve cold and take in its candied orange and jasmine amidst the bubbles."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Sweet Cheeks,16.0,90.0,"This bright and spicy wine refreshes with palate-cleansing minerality. The crisp, fresh-cut pear and apple fruit carries hints of orange liqueur. Drink this while it's in the bloom of youth."
Malbec-Merlot,France,Southwest France,Château Eugénie,16.0,90.0,"This dense and dark wine offers spice and toast flavors. It has a big, generous feel, leaving room both for the dry, still-young tannins and for aromatic blackberry fruits. It does need to age, so drink from 2017."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château de la Ragotiere,16.0,90.0,"Named after the winemaker, Amélie Couillard, this soft, rounded wine is smooth with creamed apple flavors while also having a proper tangy of acidity. That tight and tangy edge makes the wine refreshing now while also allowing it to age for a few more months. Drink now or from late 2016."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Türk,16.0,90.0,"Still closed, this only begins to show its fresh, rounded passion fruit and mango-cocktail flavors after it has had some air. The palate is concentrated and precise. This will come into its own by 2015."
Pinot Gris,US,California,McFadden,16.0,90.0,"Distinctive citrus and wild sage aromas and a dazzlingly crisp balance characterize this wine. Clean, bracing fruit flavors linger on the lively finish. Grown in a small organic vineyard, this brings authenticity at a very reasonable price."
Riesling,US,Washington,Tempus Cellars,16.0,90.0,"Another successful vintage for this wine, it maintains a clean, well-defined mouthfeel that barely registers the 1.3% residual sugar. The aromas of pear, melon and citrus rind introduce similar flavors, along with a suggestion of sweet orange candy."
Vermentino,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Piero Mancini,16.0,90.0,"Aromas of Spanish broom, ripe apricot and yellow peach lead the nose and carry over to the round palate. Fresh acidity accompanies the juicy fruit flavors while an almond note closes the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Carl Ehrhard,16.0,90.0,"Whiffs of petrol, herb and spice lend savory tones to a palate that's chock full of pristinely ripe grapefruit, peach and nectarine flavors. It's dry in style, but richly textured on the palate, with generous acidity that reverberates on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Hermann,16.0,90.0,"Crushed slate and mineral notes lend elegance to decadent yellow cherry and pineapple notes on this juicy semi-sweet Riesling. Ripe and lush yet brisk with acidity, it's an approachable, irresistible and squarely balanced wine."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Casa de la Ermita,16.0,90.0,"Rooty aromas of cola nut, baked berry fruits and blackberry jam set up a plush, jammy palate of solid tannic framework. Baked berry, dark plum and loamy notes end with meaty, roasted flavors that are typical of a well-made wine from Jumilla. This is 60% Monastrell, 25% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Pilet,16.0,90.0,"Big and bold, this is going to be an impressive Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend from a 2.5-acre plot on the Queyrens family estate. It has great red fruits and generous acidity, both of which are given a strong sense of structure by the tannins. At the moment, it is about potential, so wait until 2017."
Barbera,Italy,Piedmont,Michele Chiarlo,16.0,90.0,"Ripe black-skinned fruit, dark spice, underbrush and roasted coffee aromas lead the nose of this wine, along with an earthy note of game. The rounded, chewy palate is loaded with black cherry, black raspberry, baking spice and truffle flavors set against fresh acidity and polished tannins."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Earthworks,16.0,90.0,"The 2013 entry-level Shirazes from Barossa provide a great opportunity for wine consumers to rediscover Australia. This one is solidly structured and savory, boasting hints of black olive, dark chocolate and espresso. The finish is completely dry and firm, suggesting it'd be a fine accompaniment to beef or lamb. Drink now–2025."
Gewürztraminer,US,New York,Red Newt Cellars,16.0,90.0,"Pristine grapefruit, lemon and cantaloupe perfume this bold, fruit-forward Gewürztraminer. While off dry in style and densely concentrated in apricot and citrus flavors, it's balanced keenly in acidity and finishes with mineral refreshment."
Shiraz,Australia,Victoria,Mount Langi Ghiran,16.0,90.0,"This is MLG's entry-level Shiraz, but it's no slouch. Plum and blackberry fruit, hints of black olive and espresso, decent weight and dusty tannins provide plenty of bang for the buck. Drink now–2020."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,José Maria da Fonseca,16.0,90.0,"Based on the local Castelão grape, this wine is aged in wood for eight months. Its ripeness and soft tannins are both fruity and lightly structured. It is full-bodied, yet has enough acidity to bring out a juicy, fruity aftertaste."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Bernadotte,16.0,90.0,"With the same winemaking team as Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac, Bernadotte has a good pedigree. The wine is full in the mouth, structured and balanced, with ripe berry fruits bursting out from the tannic shell. The wine will develop well over the next few years; drink from 2017."
Moschofilero,Greece,Mantinia,Boutari,16.0,90.0,"This fresh but fruity white starts with aromas of white rose, grapefruit and citrus, followed by light and elegant flavors of lemon, grapefruit and sea salt. Playful but memorable."
Chardonnay,US,California,Guenoc,16.0,90.0,"A sophisticated Chardonnay from a winery known for good values. Buttery in aroma, it has a rich texture without being full-bodied, and is appetizingly dry and subtle in fruit flavor. Notes of toasted almond and baking spices come out on the palate and linger on the finish."
Riesling,US,Washington,Cascadia,16.0,90.0,"Bright and crisp with clean, fresh flavors of apple and pear. It's got some pretty honeysuckle in both the nose and the mouth, and the overall texture, balance and length puts it in with some of Washington's best."
Pinotage,South Africa,Simonsberg-Stellenbosch,Delheim,16.0,90.0,"Fresh aromas of strawberry and lemon are followed in flavor on the palate of this poised and balanced rosé. A touch of oak adds spice and dimension. Overall, it's delicate and delicious with good acidity. A very pretty wine at a good price."
White Blend,US,Oregon,Eight Bells,16.0,90.0,"This is a first-rate Oregon Pinot Gris made with fruit sourced from the Methven Vineyard. Crisp and steely, it's a mix of cucumber and honeydew melon fruit, with bracing acidity and excellent length."
Nebbiolo,Italy,Piedmont,Cantina del Nebbiolo,16.0,90.0,"New leather, red cherry and fresh herb aromas follow through to the firmly structured palate, along with cinnamon and white pepper notes. A young and racy wine, it already boasts finesse thanks to taut, refined tannins."
Rosé,US,New York,Kelby James Russell,16.0,90.0,"Bright raspberry and tart red--cherry notes are juxtaposed with complexities of garrigue and bramble in this elegant, spry rosé. Nuanced savoriness lends a slightly cerebral tone that's unexpected and intriguing, but also particularly suited for pairing with grilled meat and fish."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Olabarri,16.0,90.0,"Bold aromas of mint, spice and smoky cherry and plum lead to a full, fair and honest palate with choppy tannins. Toasty, minty, oak-heavy flavors of black plum, black currant, herbs and spice finish with good length and character. Drink through 2019."
Riesling,US,Washington,DaMa,16.0,90.0,"Here is yet another Washington Riesling that shows how good these wines can be. This is well beyond the sweet and fruity style of the tasting room wines; here are layers of stone fruits, density and weight, length and detail. Once in the mouth this explodes with flavor and keeps bringing the oranges, peaches, apricots, nectarines and apples to the table."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Bel,16.0,90.0,"Ripe and smoky, this is a warm fruity wine. It has tannins as well as juicy acidity, black fruits and a firm structure in the background. This will be a rich wine when it is ready to drink in 2018."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Famaey,16.0,90.0,"Smooth and spicy, this is a soft style of Malbec. It has tannins, to be sure, but they are suavely integrated into the berry fruits, the touch of mint and the spice from wood aging. The aftertaste brings out refreshing layers of juicy acidity. Drink now."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Peter Lehmann,16.0,90.0,"This nicely balanced Barossa Shiraz shows that not all Barossa wines are overweight. Sure, it has the soft, lush tannins and textures of its region, but there's also attractive herbal and savory overtones to the berry fruit."
Red Blend,US,California,McManis,16.0,90.0,"Deep, dark, oaky and tannic, this wine opens with powerful aromas of charred barrels and wood smoke. Juicy flavors of blackberry and black cherry follow, with plenty of fine-textured tannins and a lingering finish. It's made from an unusual blend of Petite Verdot and Tannat grapes."
Rosé,US,California,Zaca Mesa,16.0,90.0,"As can happen with young wines like just-released rosé, a slight bit of effervescence is visible. The interesting smell of fermentation gives rise to strawberry and pink bubblegum scents. The gum persists on the palate, but in a pleasant, not overwhelming or sweet way, as does red licorice and watermelon."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Strehn,16.0,90.0,"Notes of peppery blueberry fruit are faint on the nose but present themselves with a disarming honesty on the fresh, sprightly palate. There is a gently drying tannic structure and a great purity of dark berry which gives this an appetizing, brooding aspect. Lovely."
Verdelho,US,California,Fenestra,16.0,90.0,"Opulent fruit flavors and a good dose of vanilla and coconut give this full-bodied wine plenty of personality to go along with its heft and rich texture. Ripe pear, fig and melon notes mingle on a fresh, crisp structure."
Rara Neagra,Moldova,Moldova,Purcari,16.0,90.0,"This lovely wine offers aromas of cherry vanilla, ripe cherry and black raspberry. Fruit forward at first, it develops pronounced smoky charcuterie flavors on the palate. The tannins are fine and the finish goes on and on."
Riesling,US,New York,Knapp,16.0,90.0,"Citrus blossoms and lime zest perfume this fragrant little showstopper. Dry in style, it's a spry, delicately-framed wine, yet lusciously concentrated in peach and melon flavors. Streaks of lemon-lime acidity catapult a long, penetrating finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Luis Duarte,16.0,90.0,"This is a beautifully ripe, smooth wine. The wood aging adds a touch of vanilla to what is rich blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Touriga Nacional. Black berry fruits, rich tannins and just the right amount of acidity make a wine that will be ready to drink in the medium-term. Drink from 2016."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castellinuzza e Piuca,16.0,90.0,"Bright and delicious, this starts with aromas of blue flower, red berries, mint and thyme together with a whiff of leather. The juicy palate offers wild cherry and strawberry accented with cinnamon-spice alongside fresh acidity and firm but fine tannins. Drink now through 2016 to capture the fresh, crunchy berry character."
Baga,Portugal,Bairrada,Adega de Cantanhede,16.0,90.0,"Rich and fruity, this is a dense, wood-aged wine. It has a perfumed character as well as ripe tannins and blackberry fruits. The wine is broad, rounded and full of fruit. Drink this attractive, concentrated wine now."
Rosé,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château du Donjon,16.0,90.0,"A chalky minerality leads the nose of this Minervois rosé, mingling seamlessly with the centered notes of garrigue, crushed carnation, strawberry hull and red cherry. Medium bodied, this boasts a slightly creamy texture that's countered by ample acidity, keeping the palate lifted and the finish bright."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,16.0,90.0,"Honeysuckle, mineral, honey and botrytis aromas lead the way. This drinks off dry with exceptionally well-balanced acidity that carries through the lingering finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Husch,16.0,90.0,"Fragrant, complex aromas of rose petals and grapefruit lead to bold, fresh grapefruit and papaya flavors in this medium-bodied, dry wine. Anderson Valley is a great spot for Alsace varietals and this is a prime example."
Aglianico,Italy,Southern Italy,Grifalco,16.0,90.0,"This delicious and affordable wine offers a fragrance of blue flower, tilled soil, game and leather, along with whiffs of mature black fruit. The juicy palate delivers ripe blackberry, black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside firm but refined tannins."
Riesling,US,New York,Sheldrake Point,16.0,90.0,"While buoyantly fruity with notes of ripe peach, apricot and melon, this dry, delicately framed Riesling also has an intensely mineral character. On the palate, a shower of crushed stone and lime  acidity pierces through a long, lingering finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Johann Haart,16.0,90.0,"This fruit-driven wine lacks a touch of minerality but features admirably pure, focused notes of perfectly ripe apples, pineapple and citrus. It's a sweet, medium-bodied spätlese that's plump and succulent, delicious sipped on its own on a warm summer evening. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,16.0,90.0,"Tender, freshly cut yellow pears and yellow plums play on a rounded, rich and almost oily palate that remains dry but expresses richness in terms of texture and mouthfeel, edged with earthy and nutty notes. This finishes exquisitely clean."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Gunter Triebaumer,16.0,90.0,"The peppery, berry-ish drive of this refreshing red is already evident on the nose. The body bursts with fruit and softness but has the pleasant, tartness of wild bilberries. What energy, what joy, what medium-bodied fun. Drink soon."
Sémillon,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,16.0,90.0,"This Sémillon is quite dry, with an unusual mouthfeel that is a bit like chewing on beeswax, honeycomb without the sweetness of honey. It's a beautifully scented wine with a beguiling mix of floral and spice, suggestions of cinnamon, baking spice and body powder. Following on the palate are firm yet supple flavors of melon, pear and hints of baked apple, gliding into a smooth and satisfying finish, which resonates with hints of buttered toast."
Riesling,US,New York,Red Tail Ridge,16.0,90.0,"Fresh and citrusy in notes of lime zest and tangerine, this is a juicy, concentrated off-dry Riesling. On the palate, apples and pears are tinged with honey, spice and a bracing lemon-lime acidity. Luscious in mouthfeel yet irresistibly quaffable."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Monte Pinadillo,16.0,90.0,"Black fruit, raisin and minerally aromas combine to create a formidable bouquet. The palate is juicy and fresh, with substance and structure in support of blackberry, spice cake and licorice flavors. The finish is long, with slightly rubbery flavors."
Chardonnay,US,New York,Hosmer,16.0,90.0,"A small proportion of oak fermentation on this intensely primary Chardonnay lends depth and a rounded mouthfeel to its buoyantly fresh peach and tangerine characteristics. Cutting grapefruit and lime acidity refreshes the palate, guiding a long, pristine finish. Enjoy young to maximize its fresh appeal."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Carl Ehrhard,16.0,90.0,"Cool, steely tones juxtapose intensely sweet mango, peach and honey flavors in this delightful value kabinett. Cutting lime and lemon acidity and a briskly textured palate lead to a mouthwatering finish. Drink now through 2022."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Provincial Vineyards,16.0,90.0,"This elegant wine puts flavors of apple and citrus with floral highlights into the mix. It gains strength in midpalate, finishing strong with cinnamon, paprika and white pepper."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,A to Z,16.0,90.0,"The 2006 Chardonnay is another excellent bottle from this Oregon négociant, offering ripe and luscious fruit flavors of pear, apple, quince and kiwi. As the wine broadens out across the palate, streaks of spice, nutmeg, honey and graham cracker appear. It retains its acidic underpinnings through a generous, creamy finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Ribatejano,Quinta da Alorna,16.0,90.0,"The flagship wine from Alorna is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon, the two grapes melding well into a rich, harmonious whole. Flavors of spice, black figs and dark plum skin tannins are smoothed by 12 months wood aging. There is an edge of youth, which suggests good aging potential."
Zweigelt,Austria,Wagram,Weingut Groiss,16.0,90.0,"An intriguing headiness of red cherry promises an unadulterated purity of fruit. On the palate there is pepper, too, and more of that ripe, red cherry. This is fruit-forward, refreshing and simple but at the same time very balanced, fresh-faced and wonderfully authentic: Its honesty shines alongside the pure cherry fruit."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Pinhal da Torre,16.0,90.0,"Called 2 Worlds because of the two different vineyards that go into the blend, this is a structured, firm wine. It has a fine balance between the acidity, the tannins and the black currant fruit. With its texture and dry core, it needs time, so drink after 2015."
Sauvignon Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Reverdy-Ducroux,16.0,90.0,"Coming from flint soil, this is a structured, mineral wine. Tight texture, tangy acidity and an almost chewy character show that this young wine is still developing. It will reveal citrus and apple flavors in a year, so drink from 2017."
Lambrusco di Sorbara,Italy,Central Italy,Cleto Chiarli,16.0,90.0,"Fragrant and elegant, this vibrant wine has aromas of crushed violet and spice. The creamy palate doles out juicy wild strawberry, raspberry and cake spice alongside zesty acidity."
Riesling,US,New York,Rooster Hill,16.0,90.0,"Surprisingly complex, yet accessible and appealing, this semisweet Riesling showcases plump yellow peach flavor offset by lemon-lime, saffron and pollen. It's sunny and ripe, yet nuanced with earth and mineral tones. Delicate in body, it finishes moderately long with a touch of honey."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Jonc Blanc,16.0,90.0,"A big and rich wine, packed with fine blackberry and red plum fruits, with bitter chocolate and toast flavors. The wine is full-bodied, fruity and also stylishly elegant. Worth aging for 2–3 years."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,16.0,90.0,"From red slate vineyards in Erden and Ürzig, this is a medium-bodied dry Riesling that delivers bold pineapple, apple and citrus notes accented by hints of dry spices. The zesty acids impart a tongue-tingling quality to the long finish. Drink now–2013."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,CARM,16.0,90.0,"A lively, fresh wine, whose wood aging has just enhanced the delicious fruit flavors of mango and pineapple. The acidity bounces up and down, vibrant and crisp. Considering its origin in one of the hottest regions of the Douro, this is impressive."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Lisboa,Quinta da Cortezia,16.0,90.0,"A very aromatic, violet-perfumed wine. It has structured fruit, with wood and blackberry flavors, plenty of acidity and long-term aging potential."
Chardonnay,US,California,Benziger,16.0,90.0,"This is a delightfully crisp, elegant and lip-smacking wine, that's subtle and easy to love. Lemon peel, apple skin and pear play together well, never becoming distracting, but instead integrating well with one another and the light hint of oak. Food friendly, it's also a great deal."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Vignerons de Bel Air,16.0,90.0,"The famed Côte de Py Vineyard in Morgon has made a powerful and structured wine, with a black cherry flavor that's shaped by the dry, firm tannins. It is concentrated, dense and generous, with strong minerality and gritty texture. Age for 3–4 years."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Durigutti,16.0,90.0,"This might be the most consistent Cabernet Franc you'll find. Each of the last four vintages has scored an even 90. This rendition starts with oaky, earthy aromas of plum and charcoal. This is compact and tannic on the palate, with minty blackened chocolaty berry flavors that finish with potency. Drink through 2019."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Cave de Cleebourg,16.0,90.0,"Damask rose and honeysuckle add their sumptuous perfume to the scent of ripe peaches. Balanced and bright, the palate conveys full-fruited notes of juicy yellow plums. This wine is all about fruit and blossom, spun in a web of rounded, warm freshness."
Grenache,US,Oregon,Upper Five,16.0,90.0,"Spicy and lightly peppery, this fresh rosé brings concentrated strawberry fruit into focus. Made from organically grown grapes, it expands into a full-bodied finish with a lick of milk chocolate."
Rosé,France,France Other,Domaine Terre de Mistral,16.0,90.0,"On the basis that anything goes with rosé, this wine is 100-percent Sangiovese, known locally as Niellucciu. The acidity that is typical of the grape is very present as are red cherry and tight fruit flavors. It is so crisp and lively, bouncing from the glass and leaving a beautiful array of red fruits at the end."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Montinore,16.0,90.0,"Though it's 100% varietal, this sports a strong floral streak, as if dominated by Gewürztraminer. Baby-powder scents and accents shift into a fruit core of citrus, with Meyer lemon, oranges and pineapple."
Mencía,Spain,Galicia,Regina Viarum,16.0,90.0,"Ripe raisin and black-fruit aromas come with a licorice sidenote. This feels tight and pure but not demanding, with proper balance. Plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors give way to a spongy fruit-driven finish."
Chardonnay,US,California,Great American Wine Company,16.0,90.0,"In this wine, a core of juicy apple and Anjour pear flavors is dressed with light vanilla, nutmeg and cream accents for a beautiful, airy wine that's dry and not at all heavy. Baking spices linger on the long, vibrant finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Savor,16.0,90.0,"This is a rather light-bodied wine for its genre, but one that boasts remarkable freshness and purity of fruit. Passion fruit and cut-grass aromas lead into flavors that include white grapefruit, gentle herbal notes and stone fruit. Versatile as an apéritif or alongside any fish or shellfish."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Israel,Samson,Binyamina,16.0,90.0,"Dark ruby in the glass, this wine has a nose of lingonberry and pomegranate with a hint of pine needles. It offers well-integrated fruit and cooling herb flavors, notably blueberry, cherry, mint, tarragon, and fennel. Ultimately fruit reigns over coolness on the velvety finish."
Sémillon,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,16.0,90.0,"This wine is formulaic in a good way; L'Ecole “owns” Sémillon in Washington, and it is hard to think of any winery in the country that does a better job with the grape. Aged sur lie in neutral oak, blended with 14% Sauvignon Blanc and put through malolactic for added creaminess, this is a delicious, rich and succulent wine that deftly mixes flavors of nettle, lime and melon with vanilla custard and a hint of butterscotch."
Mission,US,California,Proulx,16.0,90.0,"One of the champions of the old Mission grape varietal, this winery continues to make strides in showcasing its potential in modern winemaking, This blend of 75% Mission, 15% Syrah, 5% Grenache, 4% Zinfandel and 1% Cinsault shows classic watermelon and bubblegum aromas on the nose, leading into a well-balanced palate of strawberry fruit, lime tang and a chalky minerality."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Quadrant,16.0,90.0,"Spiced plums and purple flowers such as violet make for an appealing aromatic profile on this well-priced wine, a blend of 57% Syrah, 23% Petite Sirah, 17% Grenache and 3% Viognier. The palate is soft with flavors of ginger and red currant, tasting elegant though not exactly restrained. The strong tannins could use until 2016 to mellow out properly."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Paschal,16.0,90.0,"Scents of hay and alfalfa open into an elegant, stylish wine with lovely textures. It is lightly citric, with pretty nuances of grass, hints of honey and tea. The winemaker has a gentle, delicate touch with all his wines, but this is the best of the best. Just 100 cases were produced."
Riesling,US,New York,Knapp,16.0,90.0,"Succulent yellow peach and honeydew flavors stand at the forefront of this slick, juicy Riesling. It's a delightfully sunny, fruit-forward wine, yet elegantly balanced, struck by line of lime acidity. The finish is moderately long, accompanied by a delicious ripple of lime-zest astringency."
Red Blend,US,California,Rock Wall,16.0,90.0,"Very ripe aromas and flavors resemble sweet raisins and prunes, but the flavors are dry and more savory than outright fruity. Black pepper, dark chocolate and charred beef notes seem perfect to pair with a grilled steak or giant portobello mushroom. It's a big-boned but well-balanced wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Cairnbrae,16.0,90.0,"Cairnbrae's 2014 is a pleasant surprise, boasting fine aromatics of celery leaf and struck flint, bold passion-fruit flavors and a long, mouthwatering finish. Subtle herb shadings and a rich texture add extra interest, but drink up by the end of 2016."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Hansen-Lauer,16.0,90.0,"Piercing quince and tangerine flavors brighten this deeply rocky, smoky wine that's full of earthy, savory complexity. Delicate and off-dry, it balances juicy citrus flavors withpert acidity. The finish is refreshingly brisk and dry."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,16.0,90.0,"Aged in neutral oak and 100% varietal, this is a fine value. There is great fruit flavor—raspberry and Bing cherry—supported with natural acidity and just a hint of chocolate. This could be a Dry Creek Zinfandel, in terms of its bright berry fruit and lively acidity."
Syrah,US,Washington,Southard,16.0,90.0,"Previously this Syrah was sourced completely from Lawrence vineyard grapes, but here they are mixed with fruit from Stonetree. It's a dark, smoky wine, with highlights of licorice around deep cassis fruit flavors. The chewy tannins finish with a pleasant streak of lovely cherry fruit."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta Le Calcinaie,16.0,90.0,"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and white peach set the tone on this refreshing savory white. The bright creamy palate doles out green apple, yellow pear and white almond alongside tangy acidity. It finishes clean and fresh."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Gradis'ciutta,16.0,90.0,"Elderflower, grapefruit, dried herb and tomato vine scents lead the way in this linear, medium-bodied white. The bright, savory palate offers honeydew melon, kiwi and juicy citrus flavors, with fresh acidity that leaves a mouthwatering finish."
Riesling,US,New York,Damiani,16.0,90.0,"The nose on this dry, medium-bodied wine is fairly neutral, with subdued aromas of lemon, lime and apple. On the palate, however, it's exuberantly floral with notes of orange blossom and white peaches accented with lime zest and acidity. Finishes long with reverberating mineral tones."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Cellers Unió,16.0,90.0,"This is generous and ripe, with spicy black-fruit aromas. It feels full but shows elegance with its depth and layering. Flavors of blackberry, plum, tobacco and oak stick out on the palate. It's long, sturdy, leathery and somewhat complex on the finish. Drink now through 2016."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,McFadden,16.0,90.0,"Definitely dry, this wine conveys precise rose petal, lychee fruit and Gravenstein apple aromas and flavors and a lively texture. Because it's rich in body, flavors linger on the finish. It will make a great apéritif with such appetizers as goat cheese toasts and roasted almonds."
Claret,US,California,Bonny Doon,16.0,90.0,"This creative blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Tannat, 13% Petit Verdot, 8% Syrah and 1% Petite Sirah offers roasted red-bell pepper, black gravel, black plums, chocolate cake and caramelized beef on the umami-driven nose. The palate is tighter, with elderberries, cranberries and decent tannic grip, proving tasty but not quite as exciting as the nose suggests."
Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Hubert Meyer,16.0,90.0,"Green pear and Granny Smith apple notes signal lightness and easy refreshment. The frothy mousse swirls the almost weightless body and brings out all the freshness. This is easy and uncomplicated, but superclean and invigorating."
Chardonnay,France,Beaujolais,Lucien Lardy,16.0,90.0,"This wine is so well balanced. It has all the right fruitiness that's filled out by a rich texture, apricot acidity and some spice. Wait a few months to really enjoy this ripe and full-bodied wine."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Global Wines,16.0,90.0,"The star white grape of the Dão—Encruzado—produces this attractive, perfumed and deliciously creamy wine. It's rich and ripely rounded, with yellow fruit balanced by the crispest lime -and lemon-like acidity. A light spice note completes the picture."
Chardonnay,Australia,Victoria,Cheviot Bridge,16.0,90.0,"Reminiscent of good white Burgundy, this atypically (for Australia) flinty Chard has notes of gunmetal, intricately intertwined with white peach and toasted oatmeal. Finishes soft and round but long, with hints of lemon."
Garganega,Italy,Veneto,Ca' Rugate,16.0,90.0,"Aromas of white wild flower and chamomile float out of the glass along with a whiff of orchard fruit. The ripe round palate offers juicy Bartlett pear, golden apple and peach. A note of bitter almond wraps up the finish."
Red Blend,US,Oregon,Cliff Creek,16.0,90.0,"Made by consulting winemaker Herb Quady, this yummy blend of Syrah, Tempranillo and (a splash of) Malbec is a showcase for what are arguably Southern Oregon's three best red grapes. Plum and cherry flavors are limned with citrus-tinged acids, making a tasty quaffable red, ready to deliver mid-week pleasure."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Manzwine,16.0,90.0,"Vines planted in a former apple orchard (pomar) give a structured, firm wine with tannins as well as dense black fruits. The dense texture comes from the ripe fruit, aged for 12 months in wood. This concentrated wine will age further. Drink from 2018."
Pinot Blanc,Austria,Burgenland,Höpler,16.0,90.0,"Very ripe fruit and a long bottle maturation gives this wine considerable concentration, richness and exotic flavors of ripe apricots, mandarin oranges and an extra layer of spice. The acidity keeps it all  together."
Rosé,US,New York,Hosmer,16.0,90.0,"While a bit quiet on the nose, watermelon, white-peach and raspberry flavors explode on the palate of this lovely dry rosé. It's exuberantly fruity but neatly balanced, offering spry acidity and a long, floral finish."
White Blend,New Zealand,Marlborough,Hunky Dory,16.0,90.0,"This medium-bodied, succulent wine blends three varieties into a complex and harmonious whole. Melon, stone fruit and grapefruit flavors are tinged with hints of peppery-gingery spice, then end long and mouthwatering."
Muscat,US,California,Bonterra,16.0,90.0,"Bonterra is offering up some serious yumminess here, from organic grapes grown in Lake County. The sweet wine opens with a sweet floral nose and a lot of minerality graduating into a concentrated thickness of golden honey-graham flavors."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Dão,Global Wines,16.0,90.0,"This late-harvest wine has hints of honeyed botrytis as well as apricot fruitiness, though it is far from cloyingly sweet. The texture is soft and mature, with good integration of the fruit and the botrytis character. Try it now with cheese or foie gras."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Quintay,16.0,90.0,"This is definitely a cool-climate SB from Chile. The nose is crisp yet not pushy, with aromas of gooseberry, nettle and snap pea along with grapefruit and lemon. A punchy, lively palate feel is just right for the wine's passion fruit, nettle, tangerine and grassy flavors, while the finish is long and cutting."
Muscat,US,California,Rosa d'Oro,16.0,90.0,"From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Sogrape,16.0,90.0,"The wine has all the classic structure and mineral tension of Dão. It gives both richness and dark, dry tannins that need several years to soften. At the same time, juicy black currant fruits give a fresh side to this complex, concentrated wine. Drink from 2016."
Pinot Gris,New Zealand,Marlborough,Tablelands,16.0,90.0,"Drawn from the cool Awatere Valley, this just off-dry wine features exceptional smoothness on the palate. Pear, guava, citrus and cinnamon aromas and flavors finish creamy and harmonious."
Rosé,US,Washington,Ardenvoir,16.0,90.0,"As one might expect, this is Washington rosé with a French touch, courtesy of consulting winemaker Christian LeSommer. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc, given a four-hour soak and then fermented in neutral oak, it is exceptional in every way. Silky and flavorful with a mix of peach and strawberry, vanilla cookie and amazing length."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Dunham,16.0,90.0,"This is a particularly lovely vintage of the popular Three Legged Red from Dunham. The fruit is a luscious bowl of cherries, with a streak of fresh peach as well. Smooth and supple, it adds gentle barrel notes of light toast, continuing on its elegant path through an extended finish."
Pinot Noir,US,Oregon,Spindrift Cellars,16.0,90.0,"Pale salmon in color, but quite robust in flavor and alcohol, this brings concentrated flavors of watermelon and raspberries, with all the freshness of the newest vintage. It's bright and focused, the very picture of what is most exciting about these seasonal Northwest rosés."
Trincadeira,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,16.0,90.0,"Produced from old bush vines, this is densely rich wine, with great structure and layers of full-bodied black fruit tones. It has a fruit and acid balance supported by concentrated tannins. It does need to age, so drink from 2017."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Lamartine,16.0,90.0,"Dark tannins and a dense texture give this wine considerably more richness than its alcohol would suggest. It also has black plum and black cherry fruits, layers of spice from wood, and a firm, dry aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Riesling,US,New York,Sheldrake Point,16.0,90.0,"Swirls of honey melt into ripe, rich pink grapefruit and peach in this decadently fruity Riesling. Off dry in style, it's lip smackingly sweet-tart, anchored by a zesty streak of tangerine acidity. Drink now–2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Israel,Samson,Binyamina,16.0,90.0,"A bright fruity nose of tart cherry and cranberry yields to surprisingly sophisticated flavors of ripe black cherry, blackberry, coffee and white chocolate. Mouth-coating tannins are at play on the palate, culminating in a finish marked by a lingering sense of zestiness."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Terra d'Oro,16.0,90.0,"Not your average Pinot Grigio, this has the depth, body and complexity of a seriously delicious wine. The aromas and flavors resemble honeydew melon, watermelon and ripe peach, while the texture is smooth—almost thick—and luxurious. It will pair well with cheese and even dishes usually reserved for red wines."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Tiefenbrunner,16.0,90.0,"Appealing aromas of acacia flower, Alpine herb and citrus follow over to the refined palate along with yellow apple, Bartlett pear and lemon zest. Crisp acidity brightens the creamy flavors."
Gros and Petit Manseng,France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,16.0,90.0,"The sweet wines from the southwest of the Gers region, made in small quantities, bring together two of the greatest grapes of the French southwest. The wine is in fact semisweet, with a dry undertone as well as acidity. It has hints of botrytis as well as orange marmalade, with a tangy aftertaste. Drink from 2019."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Halos de Jupiter,16.0,90.0,"Somewhat unusual for the appellation, this wine doesn't include any Syrah; the blend is 80% Grenache and 20% Carignan. This medium- to full-bodied wine offers hints of Mexican chocolate, ripe black cherries and dried herbs backed by a smooth, silky, long finish. Drink now–2022."
Zinfandel,US,California,McClean,16.0,90.0,"Compelling warm berry compote and orange rind aromas mark the nose of this stylishly labeled bottling, with dried fennel, cola and dill accents. The palate is as hearty as expected, with ripe blackberry, vanilla, rose petal and ginger snap flavors."
Friulano,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Gradis'ciutta,16.0,90.0,"This ripe, juicy wine opens with yellow stone fruit, Spanish broom and faint nut aromas. The medium-bodied palate doles out ripe Golden Delicious apple and mature Bartlett pear flavors, while a pleasant bitter almond note backs up the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Ramos-Pinto,16.0,90.0,"The latest vintage of one of the original wine brands in the Douro, this bold wine offers great tannins and structure along with the ripe black fruits. Balanced and generous, it is developing quickly. Drink from 2019."
Chardonnay,US,California,Sextant,16.0,90.0,"It's hard to find Chardonnays priced at less than $20 that pack this much interest. This bottling offers fresh-squeezed underripe tangerine, lemon blossoms, lemon curd, crisp Gala apple, sharp grapefruit skin and a bit of butter on the nose. A salty lemon butter and marmalade flavor show on the palate, along with pear, apple and nectarine, framed by intense acidity."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Von Schleinitz,16.0,90.0,"Whiffs of bamboo leaf, lime zest and green herb invite and invigorate on this light-bodied, off-dry Riesling. The palate is juicy and concentrated, an easy going yet tangy mix of tangerine, lemon and salty minerality that lingers long through the finish. Proceeds benefit Nashville's homeless people and pets."
Port,Portugal,Port,Wiese & Krohn,16.0,90.0,"Toffee, caramel and good maturity on this sophisticated wine. There is a spirit edge, but it works because the fruit is subservient to the maturity, ripeness and richness. The aftertaste is just perfumed."
Morio Muskat,US,Washington,Smasne Cellars,16.0,90.0,"Sweetly floral, this concentrated and penetrating wine, from some special old-vine plantings on Snipes Mountain, smells and tastes like fancy perfume in a wine bottle. Though not sweet, it could certainly be served as a dessert wine, given its exotic character."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,16.0,90.0,"This is a splendid rendition of Chateau Ste. Michelle's mainstay Cabernet, rich and round, with a sophisticated mix of grapes, including Malbec, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Dark fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis create a lush center, and the wine is more evolved and smoother, with less obvious oak and barrel flavor, than the pricier Cabs from Ste. Michelle."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodega Otto Bestué,16.0,90.0,"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Tempranillo opens with spicy berry and plum aromas. It's tight and minerally on the palate, with lightly medicinal cherry and plum flavors that are darkened by a blast of peppercorn. Spice notes and soft oak make the finish friendly. Drink through 2019."
Syrah,US,California,Michael David,16.0,90.0,"This wine is a big one, going all out to make friends. New-oak aromas like clove, cedar and cinnamon explode out of the glass, then flavors of dark chocolate and cherry spread across the palate for a generous—almost thick—impression. Fine layers of tannins and firm acidity blanket the texture."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Maddalena,16.0,90.0,"Light daffodil aromas mix with Key lime pie, soft pear flesh, pressed tuberose and apple blossoms on the nose of this relatively complex wine from an often simplistic grape. There is decent grip on the palate, with flavors of dried pome fruit, pencil lead minerality and a lemony tang."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Lecusse,16.0,90.0,"Mint flavors showcase the new wood used to age this wine. That wood balances well with the ripe, full, berry flavors and solid fruit tannins, yielding a structured and impressive wine worth aging over at least four years."
Red Blend,US,Oregon,Sineann,16.0,90.0,"This racy, vivid wine carries an Oregon AVA, but the fruit is principally sourced from warm sites in the Columbia Gorge. Bright raspberries are set amidst sappy acidity, and the structure brings both precision and vitality into play."
Red Blend,Turkey,Turkey,Kavaklidere,16.0,90.0,"Deep ruby to the eye, this blend of Öküzgözü and Bogazkere has a heady aroma of cassis and baking spices. It opens with a volley of acidity backed by solid tannins. Flavors of cherry, cassis, anisette and black pepper with a touch of rose are set in a web of long-lasting tannins. A touch of tartness on the finish keeps the tannins from stealing the entire show."
Rosé,Moldova,Moldova,Purcari,16.0,90.0,"This light pink rosé has aromas of lemongrass, mango and eucalyptus. On the palate there are strawberries and cream and raspberry. There is a slight touch of creaminess and roundness to the body with a crisp finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Robert Hall,16.0,90.0,"The first of the vintage to be tasted from the region, this bottling is a promising sign. Fresh-cut green apples, Anjou pear skins, honeydew, bubblegum, wet stone and whiffs of cut grass show on the nose. There's lots of verve to the palate, with white pepper, apple skin and slight jalapeño flavors. It's perfect for shellfish and salads."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Rex Hill,16.0,90.0,"Nicely made, this enters the palate with confidence and strikes a juicy pose, layered with white peach, apricot and pear. The fruit flavors gather strength in the midpalate, dappling in bits of baking spice, cinnamon and custard, and then gently fading into a smooth, supple finish. Classy winemaking here; this is a lovely, fruit-driven bottle with extra dimensions of texture and spice."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Kingston Family,16.0,90.0,"For Chilean Sauvignon Blanc with character, style and panache, Kingston Family's Cariblanco is a perennial pace-setter. There's mineral, sea air and tropical fruit aromas to get it going. Next in line is a flush palate of passion fruit and green apple. Finishes long and stylish, with elegance."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Navarro,16.0,90.0,"Rose-petal aromas and luscious melon and grapefruit flavors give plenty of interest to this medium-bodied, dry and ultrasmooth wine from a stalwart winery. Delicious on its own for lunch or cocktail hour, it also makes a great counterpoint with Thai food and shellfish."
Zinfandel,US,California,Sextant,16.0,90.0,"This wine from San Ardo Ranch in the San Lucas appellation wins against Zins twice the price. Black cherry and blackberry aromas meet with sensuous lilacs and wet asphalt on the nose. The palate's cherry juice front quickly turns to tobacco, dried blueberry and a tarry, dried-berry finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Argento,16.0,90.0,"Argento has found its calling with this wine, by far the best to date from this label. It's deep and pure, with raisin, blackberry, spice and vanilla on the nose. Super solid and lush, with layered flavors of jammy berry, coffee and chocolate. Holds all its form on the finish; excellent vino for the dollar."
Red Blend,Australia,South Australia,Coriole,16.0,90.0,"Despite being 51% Sangiovese, this wine comes across as more Shiraz in style, marked by dark, plummy notes, black olive, tar and coffee. It's medium-bodied, with soft, creamy tannins and a reasonably long finish. Maybe the Sangiovese just brightens things a little. Good value."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,16.0,90.0,"A wonderful mix of white pepper, fresh lemon zest, herbal pungency and green pear flavors makes Grüner Veltliner such a success. Here it all comes in one focused, friendly and easy package, with peppery length."
Riesling,Austria,Traisental,Markus Huber,16.0,90.0,"An intensely fruity wine with refreshing swathes of bright white fruits, this is fragrant and textured with lively acidity cutting through the creaminess. Very pure tasting with great depths. Age for 3–4 years. Screwcap."
Shiraz-Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Doña Paula,16.0,90.0,"Dark, mossy and rich on the nose, with dried cheese, leather, baked character and heat that pretty much comes with the territory. The palate is smooth but not flabby, with blackberry, dark plum and chocolate flavors. Mildly herbal and long on the finish, with balance. An impressive example of blended Malbec and Syrah."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Ricaud,16.0,90.0,"This generously structured wine is rich in tannins and fine, ripe black fruit. Its structure and juicy acidity will allow it to age well. Drink from 2020."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Fleur,16.0,90.0,"This smooth and ripe wine is full of dark berry fruit and layered with tannins that will allow it to age. Although rich with black plum flavors, it's balanced with acidity. Fine and ageworthy, it will be ready to drink from 2021."
Red Blend,Italy,Veneto,Monte del Frà,16.0,90.0,"Aromas of cassis and black pepper follow through to the light-bodied but savory palate along with juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry and star anise. Supple tannins give it an easy-drinking texture. Enjoy soon."
Frappato,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Terre di Giurfo,16.0,90.0,"Red rose, woodland berry and ground spice aromas lead the way on this expressive, delightful red. The vibrant palate offers juicy morello cherry, crushed raspberry and white pepper framed in zesty acidity and silky, smooth tannins. It's incredibly easy to drink."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Staete Landt,16.0,90.0,"A lovely Sauvignon Blanc at a lovely price, this shows characteristic notes of snow pea, cut grass and tropical fruit upfront, followed by hints of pink grapefruit and nectarine. It's medium in weight, with a long, stony finish."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Château Moncontour,16.0,90.0,"A piercingly delicious, apples and cream wine. It has the youthful freshness of Chenin Blanc, its texture rounded with a great bright acidity. Almonds are a glint in the background. Drink now, or age for 4–5 years."
Chardonnay,US,California,RouteStock,16.0,90.0,"This is a dry, full-bodied deal of a wine, offering melon, papaya and zesty acidity around plenty of breadth and depth. Textured and luxurious, it finishes in ginger and Asian pear."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château de la Ragotiere,16.0,90.0,"An extra year in bottle may cut down on the crispness of a Muscadet, but it does bring out so many attractive flavors. This wine boasts nuttiness and floral acidity that complements notes of white fruits and red apples. Screwcap."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,River's Edge,16.0,90.0,"Done in a distinctive style that is just shy of over-the-top, this is fermented and aged in neutral oak barrels, and sports near-15% alcohol. Rich, round and ripe, it's lightly buttery, with appealing apple and pear-tart flavors, light toast and impressive power."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Brandborg,16.0,90.0,"Do you like lemon drop cocktails? This is a lemon drop wine —so ripe and round and sweetly lemony it could almost pass for Limoncello. Despite the almost 14% alcohol, there is some sweetness, as you might find in a late harvest wine, albeit concealed by the acidity. Rose petals and talcum powder flavors coalesce into a firm, full, fruity, slightly sweet and also quite fragrant finish."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Dr. Nägler,16.0,90.0,"Whiffs of ripe red berries and stone fruit lend a particularly fruity tone to this just off-dry Riesling. While medium bodied in style, sumptuously ripe flavors of peach and nectarine give the palate a distinct plumpness. Wraps up tart and tight with a shower of citrus acidity."
Sémillon,France,Bordeaux,Clos des Justices,16.0,90.0,"A fascinating dry wine made from a 3.6 acre parcel in the Sauternes appellation, planted with Sémillon vines dating back to 1929. While it is very young, it shows great potential with spice, apricot and peach fruit and just a touch of honey. It will develop well and should be left until 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Oyster Bay,16.0,90.0,"This ticks all the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc boxes: cut grass, snow pea, nectarine and citrus, all bundled into a medium-bodied wine that comes across as dry, silky and refreshing."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Airlie,16.0,90.0,"Truly dry, with barely perceptible 6g/L of residual sugar, this is intensely aromatic. A strong and lingering impression of talcum powder dominates. It's a potent, powerful, penetrating wine, true to variety, but a bit of a challenge with food."
Pinot Bianco,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Nals Margreid,16.0,90.0,"It opens with a delicate floral fragrance of white spring flowers accented by a whiff of apple and Alpine herbs. The steely, linear palate delivers juicy yellow apples together with a mineral note and lively acidity."
Syrah,US,Washington,Hogue,16.0,90.0,"Well made and muscular, this compact effort brings black fruit, black olive, black licorice and espresso flavors together in a balanced and strikingly complex Syrah. The blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Lemberger, Sangiovese and Merlot—unusual, but it works."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Leyda Valley,Montes,16.0,90.0,"Smells like an ocean breeze mixed with field greens, citrus and passion fruit. Montes has been a leader in Chile's movement toward coastal SB, and this one is blasting with grapefruit, green apple, passion fruit and minerality. In the mouth, it has some weight and richness; but that's balanced by zippy acidity. Can't imagine a better match for ceviche or tuna tartare."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Peter Nicolay,16.0,90.0,"Waxy lime and lemon peels perfume this fresh, floral Riesling. It's invigoratingly crisp, boasting tart green-melon and tangerine flavors and racy hits of lime and lemon acidity. An elegant wine for a very approachable price."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de Porrais,16.0,90.0,"From vineyards north of the Douro River on the plateau, this wine shows both richness and a fine cool, elegant style. The wood aging has given the wine depth and extra richness, adding to the berry fruits with spice and hints of toast. It's a wine to drink soon, full of fruit and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017."
Rhône-style White Blend,Australia,Victoria,Tournon by Michel Chapoutier,16.0,90.0,"Free of restrictive appellation contrôlée regulations, Chapoutier's Australian team blends 85% Viognier and 15% Marsanne in this intense, concentrated white. Yellow plums and grilled pineapple notes aren't exceeding complex, but offer plenty of enjoyment, finishing ripe, rich and long. Drink now."
Pecorino,Italy,Central Italy,Tenuta Cocci Grifoni,16.0,90.0,"From the estate that saved the Pecorino grape from extinction, this focused and refined wine intrigues from the start, with its floral aromas of jasmine and acacia, layered with whiffs of balsamic herbs. The palate demonstrates lovely energy and elegance, with peach and tropical fruit flavors accented by mineral and almond."
Red Blend,France,Provence,Mas de la Dame,16.0,90.0,"Solid and firmly tannic, this is a wine with forward red-fruit flavors, a dry core and dense texture. The structure of this balanced wine along with its concentration promise aging. Drink from 2016."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Durigutti,16.0,90.0,"Bold, rubbery aromas of dark-berry fruits and toasty oak precede a hard-driving palate with smoky, peppery black-fruit flavors that pour on the oak and related espresso and toastiness on the finish. Drink this generous Malbec through 2019."
Chenin Blanc-Viognier,US,California,Terra d'Oro,16.0,90.0,"This dry, light-bodied wine smells vivid and fresh, like sliced peaches and canteloupe. It tastes equally fruity and ripe, backed by good acidity to keep it mouthwatering. Notable richness in the texture helps the flavors linger on the finish."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Willm,16.0,90.0,The nose has rich hints of dried lemon peel while the palate shows fresh lemon zest. The flavors on the slender but concentrated body are pure and very fresh. This is just dry and totally focuses on lemon flesh and zest. Wonderfully fresh and enlivening.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Aigner,16.0,90.0,"The nose is shy but a deeper sniff reveals ripe notes of green pear. These also appear on the compact and slender palate, accented by a bright lemon freshness. It's refreshing, clean and bright, and the finish leaves you wanting more."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Domaine Chantepierre,16.0,90.0,"This taut, intense wine is a bit angular compared to many Tavels, but pull out a bottle around Thanksgiving, and it should be singing. Cherry and citrus flavors collide on the palate, but should merge into a seamless whole with a bit of bottle age."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Magnum Vinhos,16.0,90.0,"Produced from old vines, this generous wine is ripe with black fruits, with a juicy, dense texture as well as ripe tannins. The structure is comfortably cushioned within the rich fruitiness, giving way to a crisp, lingering aftertaste. Drink now."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,16.0,90.0,"A generous ripe wine that has tannins that have been tamed by the dominance of the black fruitiness. The wine is smooth, ready to drink with its soft generous texture. Great fruit and rich tannins are well integrated. The wine finishes with a lift of acidity."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,R&A; Pfaffl,16.0,90.0,"A lovely, yeasty savor clings to more characteristic pear notes on the nose of this wine. The palate repeats this interplay, with flashes of watercress-like green herb and fresh pear skin flavors. It's refreshing, savory and dry, with a light and spritzy body."
Chardonnay,US,California,Slow Press,16.0,90.0,"This restrained, focused, well priced and crowd-pleasing Chardonnay shows butter, Gravenstein apple, Meyer lemon and almond touches on the nose. On the palate, poached apple fruit is interwoven with lemon and vanilla."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Dr. Heyden,16.0,90.0,"Clingy, concentrated peach and pink grapefruit flavors abound in this fresh, fragrant semisweet Riesling. Zesty acidity balances out all the sweet, juicy fruit, highlighting a long, pleasantly astringent lime pith finish."
Austrian white blend,Austria,Burgenland,Uwe Schiefer,16.0,90.0,"A lick of vanilla hovers over the nose, creating an unusual waxy, rich impression that becomes far more focused on the linear, taut palate. This is rounded but streamlined, with slender citrus fruit that shares the limelight with earthier notes."
Barbera,US,California,Sobon Estate,16.0,90.0,"This brilliant and affordable wine will be amazingly versatile with food, as it shows wonderful ripe black-cherry aromas, equally fruity flavors, and a fresh, almost crisp, texture that's unusual for a red wine. It has good concentration, too, and enough depth to stay interesting."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Nozières,16.0,90.0,"This young wine is packed with firm tannins and juicy black plum fruit. Its structure of tannins, both from the fruit and from wood aging, gives it a rich texture. It's spicy and ripe and needs some aging. Drink from 2020."
Merlot,US,California,Toad Hollow,16.0,90.0,"This 100% varietal wine, a steal of a deal, works in its offering of juicy plum, just enough grip and pleasant structure. Integrated oak helps it maintain a lightly firm texture on the palate, piquing in cranberry and red currant flavors on the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Domaine D'en Ségur,16.0,90.0,This is a powerfully ripe wine. It has layers of great black fruits and firm tannins. Both indicate a wine for aging. It has a concentrated juicy character along with acidity and a dry structured core. Drink this wine from 2019.
Grenache,US,Oregon,Quady North,16.0,90.0,"This delicious rosé is packed with citrus, watermelon, strawberry and apple power. There's plenty of acid and a dry finish, with a pleasing firmness to the palate."
Red Blend,Italy,Veneto,Le Fraghe,16.0,90.0,"Made with organically grown grapes and using EU-certified organic cellar practices, this delicious rosato opens with aromas of fragrant wild flower, woodland berry and baking spice. The fresh savory palate offers strawberry, yellow peach, cinnamon, herb and a hint of fennel alongside crisp acidity. A salty mineral note drives the finish. More about mineral energy than fruit, it's a rosé for grown-ups."
Cabernet Franc,US,New York,Heron Hill,16.0,90.0,"Layers of mushroom, savory spice, and earth lend depth and complexity to luscious red raspberry and cherry flavors in this complex, standout Cabernet Franc. Tart cranberry cuts through the supple and silky palate, leading to a cool, mineral finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Paarl,Glen Carlou,16.0,90.0,"The nose starts with a delicate aroma of minerals, black currant and spice, and on the palate, layers of anise, cracked pepper and clove add a soulful touch. Sturdy tannins and a vibrant overall fruit profile give the wine a lift, but the package is balanced and smooth."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Anton Bauer,16.0,90.0,"Notes of crisp green pear and crunchy red apple are very appetizing, the palate is fresh and echoes these flavors and edges them with some spice and alcoholic heat, but also has a drive and energy of its own. Friendly and very moreish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Brander,16.0,90.0,"When the slightly reductive and rubbery funk blows off about 10 minutes after opening this appellation blend, then come great aromas of rounded red apple, cut grass and wet rocks. There is a solid boost of acidity to the tip of the sip and a tantalizing structure, with flavors of Granny Smith apple and lime rinds. This is a full-bodied, even aggressive Sauv Blanc."
Syrah,US,California,Michael David,16.0,90.0,"Big but well poised and supple, this luxuriously ripe-tasting, mouthfilling, semisweet wine has enormous fruit flavors of black cherry and black currant wrapped in velvety, fine-grained tannins. It's so smooth that it's firm structure is not readily apparent."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Mouchão,16.0,90.0,"The second wine of the historic Mouchão estate, this contains less Alicante Bouschet than the top wine, while still having great power and concentration. There is a crisp feel, as well as plenty of acidity and forward black-currant fruit. It will be ready to drink from 2018."
Cabernet Franc,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Fabre Montmayou,16.0,90.0,"Cab Franc is an emerging variety in Mendoza and this jammy fleshy version won't hurt the cause. Inky berry aromas are wide and fruity, not specific. A full-volume palate is a bit heavy, with blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors. The finish hangs around with similar flavors, grapy weight and just enough acidity to maintain integrity."
Albariño,US,California,Turkovich,16.0,90.0,"This nervy, refreshing and substantive wine practically bursts with apple peel and apricot flavors. The texture is tangy but also full enough to feel rounded, and lively enough with acid and fruit to have a virtual electric charge."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Willamette Valley Vineyards,16.0,90.0,"A workhorse for the winery, this bright and focused Pinot Gris offers pinpoint flavors of melon and pear, with a strong streak of wintergreen. It's refreshing and ultraclean, with fruit flavors front and center through a medium-long finish."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,16.0,90.0,"Impressively powerful, structured wine that has spice, richness, plenty of firm tannins as well as a punch of sweet plum and red cherry flavors. There is an edge of acidity that suggests aging potential."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Gadais Père et Fils,16.0,90.0,"Just a hint of spritz gives this wine lift and brings out the ripe apple and quince flavors. This single-vineyard wine is full of freshness, a ripe slice of minerality and a spicy, peppery aftertaste. Drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Villa Wolf,16.0,90.0,"Rose petals and honey perfume this gorgeously aromatic dry Riesling, accenting ripe, succulent flavors of caramelized sugar and peaches on the palate. It's big bodied and slightly viscous in mouthfeel, but a shock of grapefruit acidity lends elegance and balance."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Dauvergne & Ranvier,16.0,90.0,"This relatively new partnership's wines have been up and down, but this one gets things just right. Black cherry and plum notes are ripe and pleasing, backed by some cedar and spice nuances. There's ample richness on the palate and a long, finely textured finish. Drink now–2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Landhaus Mayer,16.0,90.0,"A soft touch of lemon and green pear creates an appetizing nose. The palate has a salty tang on its smooth, balanced and fruity body. Easy and light, this is perfect as a refreshing, versatile white."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Kurt Angerer,16.0,90.0,"An energizing nose combines ivy, lemon, green apple and lime for utter freshness. The palate adds a savory, yeasty note to counterpoint all the lemony freshness. The mix is moreish and lively in this refreshing if light summer wine."
White Blend,Greece,Chalkidiki,Claudia Papayianni,16.0,90.0,"Sea salt and fresh white flowers lead the nose of this light, aromatic white. On the palate, the wine is focused and fresh, with a swash of sea salt and clean, brisk fruit on the finish. Pair with grilled seafood and salads."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Melrose,16.0,90.0,"A standout in Melrose's well-made, affordable lineup, this captures attractive scents and flavors of English breakfast tea with lemon highlights, and a streak of honey. Residual sugar is 18 g/L."
Rosé,Austria,Niederösterreich,Schloss Gobelsburg,16.0,90.0,"The nose does not give too much away. But the palate holds grapefruit zest cushioned by red fruit aromas that are reminiscent of rosehip and hibiscus tea. Lovely, grown-up, restrained and serious enough for food with lasting length and elegance."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Angeline,16.0,90.0,"This is a delightful, fruity white, highlighted by orange blossom and jasmine on the nose and crisp waxy green apple on the palate, with a touch of dried herb and grass. Complex and medium in weight and oak, it holds up structurally, with a juicy finish."
Muscat,France,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner,16.0,90.0,"Hints of honeysuckle are very restrained on the nose. The palate is dry and shaped by rounded lemony freshness and hints of zesty spice. This is wonderfully light and deeply aromatic, but not obviously so. A wonderfully subtle expression of Muscat."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,16.0,90.0,"Darkly tannic, Tannat-dominated wine. The structure is formidable, its rich fruit layered with the dry spice, fruit cake flavor and a powerful texture. Think of this wine with a stew, but also age for a few years."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,José Maria da Fonseca,16.0,90.0,"From the producer's own vineyards in the Douro, this is a rich wine with plenty of firm tannins and a strongly mineral character. It has juicy red fruits that are balanced by acidity. The structure and dense tannins promise aging. Drink from 2018."
Saperavi,Georgia,Kakheti,Teliani Valley,16.0,90.0,"This inky red-violet wine has a nose of blueberry pie, green pepper and violet. It is slightly tart at first sip, with tannins that hide at first and then coat the tongue and gums. A rich flavor profile of blackberry, cranberry, anise, violet and white chocolate makes way for cherry and chocolate notes in the finish."
Gewürztraminer,Chile,Curicó Valley,Montes,16.0,90.0,"On first take, this smells high-toned and much like pine and sweat. With time, out come flavors of baking spices, vanilla, lychee, apricot and honeydew melon. On the finish, this is fresh, with flavors of vanilla and botrytis. Drink now."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,La Lastra,16.0,90.0,"Enticing scents of acacia flower, chopped herb and yellow pear waft out of the glass. The juicy, delicious palate offers ripe apple, succulent white peach and citrus alongside fresh acidity. Almond and a light flinty note back up the lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,South Africa,Coastal Region,Boschendal,16.0,90.0,"This zippy, fresh sip starts with tropical fruit and citrus aromas, followed by balanced citrus and asparagus flavors. All of it dances on a racy acidity. An elegant, world-class white."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Leth,16.0,90.0,A very subtle nose slowly reveals peppery ivy notes and freshly cut peel of Conference pear. This is altogether very subtle but no less intriguing with a central thread of pure citrus focus. There is concentration and a lovely lick of enticing fresh pear fruit. Slender but beautiful.
Tempranillo,Spain,Central Spain,Volver,16.0,90.0,"Hatched from the modern model, this dark, oaky Tempranillo is saturated in color, with flush, potent aromas of boysenberry, wood spice and lead pencil. It's lively and bringing the volume, while flavors of charred, savory blackberry and barbecue end in a crusty tasting finish with some heat. Drink now through 2018."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Weinert,16.0,90.0,"Weinert holds its wines back longer than almost any other Argentine winery, hence when you get a blend like this it's mature and ready. This is maderized, with aromas of earth, citrus, tobacco and mushroom. The palate is tight and houses tobacco, mocha, citrus and dried raspberry flavors. If you like aged Rioja, this is for you. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot."
Riesling,US,New York,Billsboro,16.0,90.0,"Orange blossoms, grapefruit piths and freshly cut pineapple explode on the nose of this perfumed, yet impeccably elegant Riesling. It's gossamer-light in texture, but deeply concentrated with generous streaks of ripe yellow peach and tangerine. A bristle of bitter lime zest accompanies a long finish. Gorgeous now but substantial enough to mature well though at least 2023."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Layer Cake,16.0,90.0,"Smoky, meaty aromas meet concentrated, fully developed blackberry and cassis flavors in this full-bodied nicely oaky wine. It has a lot of spice and swagger for the price, along with polished tannins, a hint of sweetness and a good mouth-filling texture."
Chardonnay,US,California,Zaca Mesa,16.0,90.0,"One of Santa Barbara County's pioneer properties delivers an aromatically luscious wine, with aromas of white flowers, French toast, quince and lime sorbet on the nose. It's a bit like sipping perfume of tuberose and honeysuckle, yet there is bouncy acidity and chalky minerality, ensuring an emerging shelf life through 2018."
Rhône-style White Blend,US,Washington,Beresan,16.0,90.0,"This intriguing blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne and Sémillon comes from a trio of excellent Walla Walla vineyards. Fresh grapefruit, pineapple and peach notes swirl together, framed by light almond. Young, forward and delicious, it has the length and stuffing to age for another 3–5 years."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Bonterra,16.0,90.0,"This might be the best value Pinot out there. Light in color and strong in Bing cherry flavor and aroma, smoothly textured and well-balanced, it's made from organic grapes to boot. A fine and rare example of a Mendocino Pinot that's not overly complicated or fussy."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château de la Ragotiere,16.0,90.0,"A complex style of Muscadet, this starts with crisp citrus flavors and a tight structure. It has density and a fine, nervy edge that offers a delicate perfumed character as well as the possibility of aging. Drink from 2014. Screwcap."
Muscat,Australia,Victoria,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,15.666666666666666,90.0,"Medium amber in color, this Muscat boasts scents of berries, pineapple and raisin to go with flavors of honey and spice. It's a lush, sweet style, with less complexity than some, but great texture and length. Like Chambers' entry-level Muscadelle, this Muscat offers an affordable introduction to the Rutherglen style of sticky. The Muscat is full and round, with relatively simple notes of spiced orange and crème caramel and a finish that is sweet but balanced. This seems slightly fresher than the basic Muscadelle, offering more balanced flavors, including a touch of orange zest. It's sweet and long, with notes of brown sugar and citrus lingering on the long, more-ish finish."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Monte Volpe,15.0,90.0,"Livelier than usual in texture and popping with bright citrus aromas and flavors, this light-bodied and barrel-fermented wine is a great palate-cleanser and will pair beautifully with dishes like raw oysters and herbed goat cheese. It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance."
Garnacha Tintorera,Spain,Levante,Rafael Cambra,15.0,90.0,"Perfumed plum and raspberry aromas are slightly earthy and leathery. This is medium-to-full in body, with smooth, chunky tannins. Earthy, lightly baked plum and wild-berry flavors finish loamy and expansive. Drink through 2017."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Firesteed,15.0,90.0,"Bone dry and replete with skin flavors of pear and grapefruit pith, this is perfect for those who want to keep their alcohol consumption down without turning to a sweeter style of wine. Try it with grilled sausages and sauerkraut."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Firesteed,15.0,90.0,"Fresh cut pear fruit flavors carry this wine. It's crisp and clean, with fresh fruit balanced against natural acidity. Drink it now while the freshness is paramount."
Carmenère,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Carmen,15.0,90.0,"Composed berry, spice, herb and oak aromas are complete and inviting. In the mouth, this is ripe and dense, with chewy tannins. Blackberry, mixed herb and dark chocolate flavors are integrated, while this settles nicely on the finish."
Shiraz,Australia,Australia Other,Hungerford Hill,15.0,90.0,"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now–2018."
Viognier,US,Washington,Stevens,15.0,90.0,"This super-smooth late harvest effort is perfectly balanced among sugar/alcohol/acid components. Lively and rich, it offers concentrated flavors of limoncello, apricot and candied peaches. Drink it chilled for best effect."
Syrah,France,Rhône Valley,Michel Gassier,15.0,90.0,"This is as perfumed an example of Syrah as you'll find from the Southern Rhône. Hints of herbs, spice and violets accent blueberry fruit in this charming wine. It's medium in body—not that rich but or layered but supple, silky and easily accessible. Drink this through the end of 2015."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,15.0,90.0,"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Allram,15.0,90.0,"Freshly cut pear, ivy leaf and spice mark the nose of this wine. The palate is slender but juicy, full of citrus-fresh fruit. It's all about joy and drinkability, feeling more structured and serious on the clean finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca Vides,15.0,90.0,"Solid and smooth from the beginning, with cola, pastry and blackberry aromas. The palate is fresh, full and healthy, with cola, black pepper and a ton of berry push. Toasty and roasted on the finish, where coffee comes into play. Right on the spot for value-priced Malbec."
Agiorgitiko,Greece,Nemea,Kintonis,15.0,90.0,"Thyme and crushed herbs on the nose of this red lead into flavors of sweet spice, smoked meat and boysenberry. The wine has an exotic spin and a balanced overall character. Elegant and distinctive."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rancho Zabaco,15.0,90.0,"This wine delivers on richness of flavor without being overwhelming or overdone. Refined in soft tannins and a core of expressive, juicy blue and black berry fruit, it is seductive and smoky on the finish, sourced mainly from vineyards in the Dry Creek Valley."
Viognier,US,California,Hansen Cellars,15.0,90.0,"Rich in flavor and texture, this smells like white peach and buttered popcorn with a hint of chalky earthiness. The taste is creamy and reminiscent of honey and toasted almonds. It is medium bodied, but lush and almost thick in mouthfeel, with flavors that linger on the finish."
Sémillon,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,15.0,90.0,"L'Ecole tackles, with great success, two of the least-recognized strengths of Washington viticulture: Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. Here the blend includes 13% Sauvignon Blanc. It's well built, full bodied, with a mix of citrus and stone fruits, generous acidity, and some finishing skin flavors putting a slightly bitter frame around it."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Alain Jaume et Fils,15.0,90.0,"This blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Cinsault would be a crowd favorite if more than 700 cases were available in the U.S. The black cherry fruit is punched up by hints of herbs and cracked pepper, there's ample weight but great freshness and zest, and the finish is long and complex, showing off hints of licorice, pepper and dusty earth. Drink now–2020."
Riesling,US,Washington,Vino La Monarcha,15.0,90.0,"This is an aromatic wine, with scents of green melon candy, lime zest, white flowers and white peach. It drinks off dry, with stone-fruit flavors brightened by zippy acidity leading to a mouthwatering finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Whiplash,15.0,90.0,"Concentrated flavors and a richly tannic texture make this dry wine more sophisticated and interesting than many other red blends. It combines cranberry, black cherry and cinnamon notes for a mouthfilling and harmonious impression."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Casal da Coelheira,15.0,90.0,"A blend of Chardonnay and Arinto, this wood-aged wine is rich and packed with both toast and fruit flavors. Vanilla and apple and citrus acidity are generously pulled together by the mineral texture and ripe structure. The wine will be best from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Cannonball,15.0,90.0,"A steal for its price, this wine is refreshingly quaffable, with a sublimely textured palate of preserved lemon and nectarine. It's both lush and surprisingly complex."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine de la Vallongue,15.0,90.0,"Produced from organic grapes, this is a ripe, full and deliciously fruity wine. It has a good balance between wild strawberry fruits and tight, textured acidity that gives the wine shape. The aftertaste is bright and crisp."
Red Blend,US,America,Sokol Blosser,15.0,90.0,"Look for the tiny e.6 on the label, indicating that this nonvintage blend is the sixth edition. The blend includes Syrah, Sangiovese and Montepulciano, and it's truly inspired. Call it a perfect bistro red, ready for burgers or pizza, matching charming red fruits to well-balanced tannins."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Haut Bourg,15.0,90.0,"This is an immediately attractive and fruity wine. Bright acidity is rounded out by warm peach and pear flavors, with a mineral texture that will allow the wine to age. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be at its best from 2016."
Riesling,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,15.0,90.0,Fragrances of peach and grapefruit set the scene for flavors of white peach and lemon peel with soft touches of menthol and a tangerine rind finish. This wine is smooth on the palate with a nice combination of creaminess and lemon-fresh acidity.
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,15.0,90.0,"While Alicante Bouschet is probably more at home in the Alentejo, this wine from the coastal Lisboa region still has much of the dark color, solid, dry tannins and intensely juicy wild-berry fruits. It is ready to drink."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Tour de Mirambeau,15.0,90.0,A light touch of toastiness gives this Despagne family wine extra richness. It offers spice as well as plenty of crisp green and citrus fruits. The two elements balance and will allow this wine to age well. Drink from late 2017 or even early 2018.
Champagne Blend,France,Loire Valley,Domaine du Petit Clocher,15.0,90.0,"Aged, like so many Loire sparkling wines, in the caves of Saumur, this is a rich wine. It has a nutty charm as well as ripe apple and white stone-fruit flavors. Its acidity is finely integrated giving a smooth wine. It is ready to drink."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade do Rocim,15.0,90.0,"There is a rich blend of Aragonez, Touriga Nacional, Trincadeira and Syrah in this full, ripe, black-fruit tinged wine. It is already open and generous, with wood spice tones and a smooth texture. Drink now through 2018."
Lemberger,US,Washington,Kiona,15.0,90.0,"Lemberger was planted here in the 1970s, and Kiona still carries the torch for the grape. Earthy, gamy, soft and smooth, it has a quickly maturing flavor set, built upon chocolate and cherries, with dusty tannins."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Château Bianca,15.0,90.0,"This lovely wine captures the floral, perfumed essence of the grape in a restrained, sippable style. It's dry and crisp, with lemony fruit and the delicate sensation that you are drinking fresh flowers."
Red Blend,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Pala,15.0,90.0,"A savory blend of 40% Sangiovese, 30% Monica and 30% Carignano, this vibrant red offers aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, tilled soil, leather, cooking spice, carob and violet. The chewy palate delivers ripe black cherry, juicy blackberry, ground clove and dried Mediterranean herb alongside round, enveloping tannins that give it a velvety texture."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Roth,15.0,90.0,"Tingling acidity wraps around a core of pear and peach fruit in this well-integrated, layered and lush wine. The oak is quiet through the entry and midpalate, picking up power and weight on the finish. Lovely on its own, it's also a good choice for the table."
Riesling,Germany,Rheingau,Carl Ehrhard,15.0,90.0,"Broad in the mouth and rather burly, this nearly dry Riesling offers minerally, spice-driven aromas and flavors. A touch of honeyed richness on the palate rounds it out, but this is not a stereotypical fruity Riesling despite the mouthwatering finish."
Riesling,US,Washington,Convergence Zone,15.0,90.0,"Scented with notes of pine needle and lemon polish, this puts its concentration square in the mid-palate. There are pretty traces of honeyed botrytis, and a suggestion of sweetness, though the acidity keeps it on the dry side. Excellent length, with a pretty finish of honey and tea."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Leira,15.0,90.0,"An elegant and well-made Albariño with lemon chiffon, pear and green apple aromas. The palate is just right in feel, depth and minerality, with apple, pear, honeydew and hidden spice flavors. Clean, teetering on lush and delicious as it finishes. Drink this pretty wine as soon as possible."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Bonnet-Huteau,15.0,90.0,"This is a rich style of Muscadet, ripe with red apples and lemon acidity. It's full bodied, structured with some minerality and a tight, nervy texture. It's a delicious wine that could be aged, so drink from 2016."
Syrah,US,California,Cameron Hughes,15.0,90.0,"The reliable négociant winery scores once again on this bottling, which shows intriguing aromas of smoked plums, hoisin-marinated pork, cocoa powder, crushed pepper and ollallieberries. It's delicious once sipped, with pepper, boysenberries and a hickory wood character."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Alentejo,Mouchão,15.0,90.0,"A blend of Arinto and Antão Vaz, this is an impressively structured and concentrated wine. Ripe and flowery, with flavors of mango and yellow fruit. The smooth yet tangy structure gives pleasure now, but also promises aging. Drink until 2019."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Alentejano,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas,15.0,90.0,"Dense dusty tannins dominate this 100% Touriga Nacional wine, powering its black fruits and acidity.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Casa Santos Lima,15.0,90.0,"This is a ripe, impressively rich wine. With dense tannins, spice and layers of black fruits it is concentrated, wearing its high alcohol easily. It comes from one of the home estates of Casa Santos Lima in the heart of the Lisboa region. Drink this wine from 2018."
Sauvignon Blanc,Austria,Burgenland,Nittnaus Hans und Christine,15.0,90.0,"Heady aromas of very ripe passion fruit as well as crackling, zingy acidity combine here to great, refreshing effect. Intense and very long with quintessential varietal character, it delivers a real dash of tropicality."
Riesling,Germany,Nahe,Prinz Salm,15.0,90.0,"This off-dry Riesling's honey-kissed peach and nectarine flavors are lip-smackingly sweet. Its light, sprightly texture and high-toned acidity lend balance and refreshment. Brisk and easy-drinking, it offers loads of quaffable appeal."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Toutigeac,15.0,90.0,"The fifth generation of the family to make wine at the estate, Oriane Mazeau has created a delicately spicy wine that is lively and fruity. A floral character gives it a lift, as does crisp acidity. Bright, with plenty of flavorsome fruitiness, the wine is already a pleasure to drink."
Chardonnay,Austria,Burgenland,Markus Altenburger,15.0,90.0,"Reduced when first opened, this wine shows its lemony, fresh apple notes with a bit of air. It has the lovely midpalate texture and freshness inherent to good Chardonnay and fills the mouth with citrus and orchard fruit notes. Slender, structured and fresh-faced, it only needs some time to breathe."
Garnacha,Spain,Northern Spain,Cameron Hughes,15.0,90.0,"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha."
Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Castello di Gabbiano,15.0,90.0,"Made with 90% Sangiovese, 5% Merlot and 5% Colorino, this straightforward, savory wine opens with aromas of ripe berry, tobacco, blue flowers and a whiff of cedar.

Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Rocca delle Macìe,15.0,90.0,"Tilled soil, ripe plum, blue iris and a whiff of spice come together on the nose. The vibrant, juicy palate offers ripe wild cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha and clove alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2018."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta das Carvalhas,15.0,90.0,"With its classic blend of Douro grapes, this is a serious, structured wine from the heart of the valley. It has a leathery edge from dry tannins along with dense black fruit and wood aging flavors. It still needs cellaring, so drink from 2017."
Loureiro,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Quinta do Ameal,15.0,90.0,"The Loureiro is the grape of the Lima Valley subregion in Vinho Verde. The texture of the wine is rounded and creamy, although the crisp green fruits give a great bright lift to this delicious, fresh wine."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Saveé Sea,15.0,90.0,"This wine does a nice job balancing its tropical fruit aromas and flavors with leafy, green notes. Ripe nectarine and grapefruit lie at the core, while herbal flourishes garnish the nose and finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Hardys,15.0,90.0,"An excellent value, Hardys' Oomoo Shiraz can run with a pack twice its price, offering earth and cola aromas and a deep undercurrent of blackberries. It's full-bodied, mouthfilling yet structured. Adds flavors of black olives to the mix, along with velvety tannins and mouthwatering acids on the finish."
Lemberger,US,Washington,Kiona,15.0,90.0,"Lemberger, also known as Blaufränkisch, was planted here in the 1970s—the winery believes it was the first commercial bottling in the country. This is a seriously good wine, worthy of special attention. It could be mistaken for a particularly fine country wine from Italy, southern France or Spain, with its old vine complexity, red and blue fruits and whiff of tanned leather."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Estampa,15.0,90.0,"Savory and earthy up front, this blend of Malbec and Petit Sirah is quite ripe and not at all herbal. In the mouth, it's cushioned and rich, while dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and pepper finish a touch bitter, like dark chocolate or a cup of espresso."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Tamarack Cellars,15.0,90.0,"A well-integrated mix of grapes from a broad range of vineyards across the entire Columbia valley, this outstanding value proves that good Chardonnay does not have to be strengthened by age in new oak barrels. Stone fruits, hints of tropical papaya and banana, contribute to a complex, fruit-driven, well-balanced wine with medium-term aging potential."
Saperavi,Georgia,Kakheti,Dilao,15.0,90.0,"Deep garnet in the glass, this wine offers a tight nose of black cherry before filling the mouth with flavors of blackberry, cherry, dark chocolate and lavender. Soft tannins that are slow to make their presence known persist into the bright cherry finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Minho,Quinta de Soalheiro,15.0,90.0,"The blend of Vinho Verde's two top grapes brings out great swathes of crisp acidity as well as vibrant citrus flavors. The wine is delicious while also tense with minerality. That will soften over the next few months, so drink the wine starting from late 2017."
Pinot Gris,France,Alsace,Ruhlmann,15.0,90.0,"Friendly inviting notes of ripe juicy pear appear immediately on the nose and are also amply present on the palate.

Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider,15.0,90.0,Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend complexity to decadent honey and apricot in this medium-sweet auslese.

Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Alorna,15.0,90.0,"This wood-aged wine is ripe, lightly toasty and definitely spicy. It has a creamy, rounded texture that is rich and zingy, layering acidity with citrus and yellow fruits. Drink this wine from 2017."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,15.0,90.0,"Spice, licorice and herbal notes complement red-fruit aromas, while the palate offers plenty of structure and tannic grab.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,15.0,90.0,"This is a richly structured wine. With its juicy red fruits and generous structure, it is delicious now. Berry flavors and acidity go with the mineral edge of the texture to create a wine that is packed with acidity, tannins and fruit. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Lestruelle,15.0,90.0,"Still very young, this is a Maison Bouey wine with good potential. It offers hints of the ripe yellow fruits and richness that will come as it develops. The touch of perfumed spice means it is also a wine to savor as an apéritif."
Ribolla Gialla,Slovenia,Goriska Brda,Colliano,15.0,90.0,"This Slovenian Ribolla Gialla has aromas of peach and vanilla, with flavors of freshly baked peach pie, canned apricots and green apple. It is soft on entry, rounded in the mouth and shows good minerality on the finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Unger,15.0,90.0,"The nose is rather closed but this bursts into life in the mouth with lip-smacking citrus freshness and notions of tart stone fruit along a linear, driven palate. Whistle-clean and just a little bracing, this is a textbook Riesling from the fresh 2014 vintage. It's light-bodied but shows lots of verve."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Levante,El Molet,15.0,90.0,"Sweet blackberry aromas come with floral edgings, and the whole is impressive. Full-bodied and balanced, with healthy, ripe black cherry and dark plum flavors. Finishes spicy, with a note of bitter espresso. 90% Tempranillo with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. One of the best wines from Valencia."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Sainte Marie,15.0,90.0,"Ripe and toasty, this is a rich, full-bodied and juicy wine. It has ripe berry fruits, touches of black currant and balancing acidity. Wood aging supports the palate and adds considerable potential. Drink this fine wine from 2016."
Pinot Blanc,France,Alsace,Jean-Marc Bernhard,15.0,90.0,Very ripe pear plays on the enticing nose. The palate has the same refreshing and appetizing fruitiness. Lemony brightness pervades the light-bodied palate and makes for a very moreish finish.
Alsace white blend,France,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,15.0,90.0,"The rosy floral overtones of Muscat are very evident on the fragrant nose. The palate, on the other hand, gives us the texture of Pinot Gris and the freshness of Riesling while floral nuances hover and swirl. This is a lovely blend of all that Alsace does well. Friendly and fresh with a dry finish."
Pinot Grigio,Australia,Victoria,Redbank,15.0,90.0,"This is a dry, relatively austere wine. It showcases aromas of wet stone and lemon thyme, followed by flavors of pineapple and lemon and a long, citrusy finish. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Quintay,15.0,90.0,"Pungent and precise, with a textbook mix of green aromas, tropical fruits and lushness. Feels lively and juicy, with lime, lychee, green apple and pineapple flavors that settle on passion fruit come finishing time."

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Wines & Winemakers,15.0,90.0,"A big, ripe and spicy wine that is full of red fruit notes and gentle tannins. It is open and accessible, its fruit juiciness already a pleasure to taste. There is fresh acidity on the finish. Drink now through 2019."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Portugal,Lisboa,Companhia das Quintas,15.0,90.0,"Cabernet Sauvignon in the cool Lisboa region has a similarity to Bordeaux. It gives a structured, black currant flavored wine, with firm tannins, a mineral texture and serious acidity. The wine is tight and should age well. Drink from 2014."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Stadt Krems,15.0,90.0,"A rather closed nose wants to give little away, but the palate is zingy with yeast, grapefruit peel and fresh, greenish leafiness, all held with focus and poise. Very refreshing."
Chardonnay,US,California,Harken,15.0,90.0,"A tasty tang of toasted oak adds a great top note to this full-flavored and full-bodied wine, so that it seems to build complexity from the bass notes of ripe pear, to the butter and cinnamon in the middle and up to the wrapping of spicy, smoky oak."
Riesling,Australia,Western Australia,Rocky Gully,15.0,90.0,"A little less austere and easier to drink than many dry Aussie Rieslings, this wine features lime and vanilla shadings on the nose, and ample apple, melon and citrus flavors. It's fullish and round, despite only 12.5% alcohol, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2010."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Faustino Rivero Ulecia,15.0,90.0,"Generous aromas of root beer, lemon, licorice, wood smoke, blackberry and prune set this off on a good course. The palate is sinewy and chewy, with baked, minty blackberry flavors that are peppery and toasty as well as savory, meaty and slightly stewed on the finish. Drink through 2019."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,15.0,90.0,"A blend of Viognier and Arinto, this wine is given another dimension from wood aging. A smoky character adds complexity to ripe apricot and crisp quince flavors. This is juicy and rich while having a refreshing aftertaste."

Riesling,US,Washington,Seven Hills,15.0,90.0,"Sourced from mature plantings in cool sites, this exemplary Riesling is technically off dry, but retains its apple-fresh snap and tang.

Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,East Coast,Tablelands,15.0,90.0,"Fruit from Martinborough and Hawkes Bay features in this value-priced wine. Despite ample weight and fleshy texture, it manages to finish dry and elegant, with shadings of fig, white grapefruit, fennel and pineapple."
Riesling,Australia,South Australia,Pikes,15.0,90.0,"Despite its modest alcohol level, this bottling speaks of ripe fruit. Lime and bergamot aromas bring a floral element, while the flavors are of tangerine and nectarine. A touch of residual sugar adds roundness to the mouthfeel."
Encruzado,Portugal,Dão,Dão Sul,15.0,90.0,"Encruzado is the Dão's star white grape, able to produce, as here, a wine that combines a great sense of style, some weight, along with the freshest of lemon tints. There is some fullness as well, while the final taste is crisp."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,15.0,90.0,"Pure Alicante Bouschet is rare in the cooler Lisboa region, but this wine certainly reveals much of the richness and intense fruit that makes this grape so popular among producers. It is a rich wine, with structure as well as fruit, that is ready to drink now."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine de Roche-Guillon,15.0,90.0,"This is a rich and full-bodied wine. While it is certainly packed with crunchy cherry flavors, it also has a more tannic and structured side giving it a firm texture to back up the fruitiness. The aftertaste is juicy and ripe."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Vaucher Père et Fils,15.0,90.0,"Produced by a négociant based in Nuits-Saint-Georges, this is a ripe, Burgundian take on Beaujolais. This creates a full, plum and black cherry flavored wine where the tannins have been cushioned by the generous fruit. It does have the typical acidity and freshness of the year to give a lift. Drink now."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,15.0,90.0,"A fine and rich blend of Chardonnay and Arinto, this wine has touches of spice and vanilla as well as crisp, bright fruit tones.

Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,15.0,90.0,"Lifted pear-drop aromas are accompanied by the peppery green of watercress and arugula.

Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,15.0,90.0,"In contrast to a nose that's more mineral than fruit, the intensity of this wine's voluptuous nectarine and yellow peach flavors surprise. It's dry in style but with a succulent fruitiness that clings delectably to the palate. Finishes long and lean with a tang of steely minerality. Drink now through 2019."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Red Knot,15.0,90.0,"Asphalt, licorice and espresso mark the nose of this medium-bodied, juicy Shiraz. The flavors are brighter, hinting at rhubarb, yet still retaining a dark, tarry edge. Drink this mouthwatering wine over the next few years."
Riesling,US,Washington,Mackey Vineyards,15.0,90.0,"Off dry it is, with flavors of Meyer lemon and black tea and plenty of acid. It is a fine value for the price, with density, concentration, purity of fruit and grip. Fruit runs through citrus into light tropical; the sugar falls out in the very finish but is balanced nicely against the acids."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,MontGras,15.0,90.0,"Sweet and smoky on the nose, with prune, hickory and spice aromas that come together well. The palate on this four-grape blend is saturated and meaty, while the flavors of blackberry, coffee and dark plum are lush and finish with toast and spice.

Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,David Hill,15.0,90.0,"There's a delicate lemon scent, leading into a mix of citrus, grapefruit peel and honeysuckle. The wine gains weight in the mouth, showing ripe fruit (yellow apples) and a soft, lightly oxidized finish with toasted coconut and cracker. Quite delicious, distinctive and rich."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,David Hill,15.0,90.0,"Fresh and satisfying, with flavors of apples and pears, brioche and vanilla cream. What stands out is the full, round midpalate, and the way the wine keeps resonating through an extended finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Fitapreta Vinhos,15.0,90.0,"A smooth, rounded wine, with depth of black berry, dark plum and licorice flavors. It is solid, chunky, powerfully ripe, full of pepper, spice as well as sweet acidity. Very enticing and rich."
Riesling,US,Oregon,A to Z,15.0,90.0,"Just a hint of sweetness—mostly from ripe fruit rather than residual sugar—livens up this fresh and fruity Riesling. It's a mouthful of lemon, lime and peach fruit flavors, supple and fleshy. A streak of English breakfast tea adds interest through the finish."
Rosé,US,California,Carol Shelton,15.0,90.0,"This substantial dry rosé, mostly made from Carignane grapes, is extremely rich in color. Likewise, the flavors have plenty of juicy red wine notes like cherry, raspberry and earthy spices, and it balances well between good acidity and creamy viscosity. It can almost substitute for a red wine, and will add depth to occasions with equally flavorful food."
Sylvaner,France,Alsace,René Muré,15.0,90.0,"Grated lime zest on the nose leads to an uncompromisingly but refreshingly brisk palate. This has freshness and a stony, almost chalky depth and wonderful concentration and freshness. It's dry, brisk and invigorating."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Jones of Washington,15.0,90.0,"This well-made, pure Sauvignon Blanc seems to have a noticeable amount of residual sugar—not surprising in a high acid vintage such as 2011.

Riesling,US,New York,Hosmer,15.0,90.0,"While the nose is restrained, the palate of this off-dry Riesling bursts with sweet, luscious pink grapefruit, guava and peach flavors.

Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Innocent Bystander,15.0,90.0,"This Australian (Yarra Valley-based) brand has bottled an excellent Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.

Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Val do Sosego,15.0,90.0,"A mix of youthful freshness and lees scents blend nicely with spiced apple aromas in front of a tight, citrusy palate.

Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Carnivor,15.0,90.0,"Dark in color, deep in aroma, quietly intense in flavor and so mouthcoating in texture—this Cabernet demands to be noticed.

The flavors are like dark chocolate and ripe blackberries, the mouthfeel is fine and it's not overly tannic or too full-bodied."
Red Blend,US,America,Sokol Blosser,15.0,90.0,"Like the Evolution White, this nonvintage blend is labeled by edition, this being the fifth. The blend includes Syrah, Sangiovese, Montepulciano and a splash of Evolution white. It's built for quaffing, and would be just as comfortable in a camp-friendly bota bag as on your dinner table. Cranberry fruit underlined with a strong streak of slate keeps it fresh and lively."
White Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Huguet de Can Feixes,15.0,90.0,"Apple, melon and apricot aromas are pure and come with zero interference from natural funk or oak.

Gewürztraminer,US,California,Husch,15.0,90.0,"Husch has been making Gewurztraminer for a long time and has it down pat.

It smells and tastes floral, peachy and a little nutty, with medium body and good acidity to balance it."
Rosé,Austria,Burgenland,Markus Altenburger,15.0,90.0,"A restrained nose softly hints at tart berry and citrus. The palate is fresh but less precise when it comes to fruit: the body is light, dry and fresh, with a lasting note of citrus zestiness. With a clean finish and a tiny hint of grip, it's a wonderful rosé for the table."
St. Laurent,Austria,Burgenland,Sattler,15.0,90.0,"Ripe red and luscious black cherry are the fruity protagonists here, dominating nose and palate with their dense, aromatic ripeness.

Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Bodegas Luzón,15.0,90.0,"Leather and earth aromas are subtle, with oak and berry scents lurking. This Monastrell blend has a solid mouthfeel and firm tannins that scrape a little but also give structure. Plum, raspberry and herbal flavors finish woodsy and ultimately oaky as smoke and spice notes fade."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Casas del Bosque,15.0,90.0,"Casas del Bosque makes some of the most pungent, expressive Sauvignon Blancs in Chile. This vintage fits the blueprint; it's forward, punchy and full of passion fruit, white grapefruit and tarragon on both the bouquet and palate. Shows mineral components, saline and scallion on the finish. A high-quality wine with a commensurate price tag."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Branne,15.0,90.0,"While the wine is dominated by flavors of wood aging, it also has fine fruit weight that will come through. Then it will be a powerful and concentrated wine, rich and full of blackberry and black plum fruits. The structure will keep this fruitiness in order. Drink from 2017."

Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Maule Valley,Calina,15.0,90.0,"This Alcance Cab is arguably the best we've had from them to date.

A real mouthful, with toasty mocha and vanilla on the finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Gotham,15.0,90.0,"Mint notes accent blueberry and plum fruit, while hints of tar and black olive add a savory edge. This medium- to full-bodied Shiraz is creamy on the midpalate, but firms up enough on the finish to pair well with burgers or steaks. Drink now–2020."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Príncipe de Viana,15.0,90.0,"Bold black-fruit aromas are pure and inviting. ?Overall, this blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is flush in feel, balanced and full of wild berry ?and plum flavors.

Pinot Noir,Austria,Burgenland,Esterházy,15.0,90.0,"A gentle hint of soft and mellow vanilla frames the ripe, red-cherry fruit that appears readily on the nose.

Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Joseph Drouhin,15.0,90.0,"In a firm style, this is a dense wine, its black fruits packed into a solid structure. It has power as well as ripe fruit, with tannins and acidity, and is likely to age for a couple of years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,La Playa,15.0,90.0,"The days of the 90-point Best Buy are growing short, so rejoice over this excellent blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Petit Verdot. The nose hits with solid mint, coconut, blackberry and fudge aromas, while the palate is ripe, snappy, alert and full of tasty blackberry, cherry and chocolate. It's clean as can be, with immaculate freshness given its price point. Drink up. Only 500 cases made."
Red Blend,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Bessa,15.0,90.0,"A heady aroma of cherry, coffee and clove with a whiff of mint paves the way for luscious flavors of raspberry, pomegranate and eucalyptus. This wine is silky in the mouth, with a fleeting impression of pomegranate and mint at the soft finish."
Furmint,Hungary,Tokaj,Patricius,15.0,90.0,Enticing aromas of pear and white peach set the stage for flavors of peach nectar and slightly tart white plum. This wine is full in the mouth with a bright citrus note on the finish.
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Wente,15.0,90.0,"Flinty, mineral-like aromas and flavors lend a complex personality to this compelling, medium-bodied wine. The palate is crisp, dry and citrus-driven, inviting another sip and begging for some fresh-shucked oysters."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Benziger,15.0,90.0,"This well-made wine has the classic fresh herb and gooseberry aromas, followed by tangy acidity and bright lemon and grapefruit flavors. It's a lively one: light, dry and well-balanced, not to mention very affordable."
Rosé,France,Provence,Ravoire et Fils,15.0,90.0,"The 123-acre estate has been in the Rabarin family for 150 years, yielding both wine and market-garden produce. This is a delicious, crisp wine full of red-currant freshness with a tight, mineral character. It is concentrated with pepper overtones and a nervy, bright aftertaste."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Awatere Valley,The Crossings,15.0,90.0,"Grassy, herbal notes accent pink grapefruit on the nose. There's ample weight without it ever seeming heavy, and a silky feel to the wine that lingers on the finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Thurston Wolfe,15.0,90.0,"This is a particularly fine vintage for the popular Dr. Wolfe's, maintaining the customary blend of Primitivo, Lemberger and Petite Sirah. Dark and smoky, with dense flavors of berry, cassis, licorice and dark chocolate, it is far more substantial than most red blends in this price range."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,15.0,90.0,"The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit. This wine is velvety in feel, displaying a mixture of fruit and barrel that carries through the finish. The oak influence is heavy but the appeal is impossible to ignore."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine de l'Amaurigue,15.0,90.0,"Night-harvested to keep freshness, this wine has a bright, cool character. Lively acidity is filled out with spice, caramel and a peppery character. Wild strawberries and yellow-fruit flavors have just a light texture from the 20% Syrah in the blend. Drink now."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Mommessin,15.0,90.0,"A wine with an important structure, tasting very young at this stage. There is great acidity through a lovely, fragrant, forward wine. The acidity gives everything a lift of fruitiness."
Chenin Blanc,US,Washington,L'Ecole No. 41,15.0,90.0,"L'Ecole consistently makes the best Chenin Blanc in the Northwest, if not the entire country. Done in an almost-dry Vouvray style, this engages the full range of varietal flavors. This has a scent of white flower and flavors of stone and citrus fruit, with overriding freshness and vitality that are heightened by the snappy, juicy acidity."
Red Blend,Chile,Colchagua Valley,Estampa,15.0,90.0,"Dense cassis and berry aromas aren't nuanced or complex but they sure are correct and ripe. Overall, this value-priced wine is rich and balanced, with good acidity and a chewy palate that softens up with time. Plum, berry, cassis and cherry flavors are tasty and easy to like."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Saint-Pierre,15.0,90.0,"This is a well-balanced wine that is both crisp and breezy and full of delicious red-berry fruits. It has a tight texture, with some minerality and a tangy aftertaste. This should make for an excellent apéritif."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Nodland,15.0,90.0,"It's tough to find a Walla Walla wine at this price with this much concentration and power. In the mouth it has a plush, soft appeal, with a lush mix of fruits and generous barrel flavors of chocolate and baking spices. It was aged for two years in a mix of new and used French and American oak."
Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,R+,15.0,90.0,"Ripe, earthy berry and cassis aromas smell damp at first but unfold nicely. Bright acidity and abrupt tannins make for a packed palate. Lightly oaky flavors of plum and berry show a note of vanilla. It finishes crisp and choppy due to the aforementioned bold acidity. Drink through 2022."
Lemberger,US,Washington,Kiona,15.0,90.0,"This wine has become a signature variety for this winery, and this vintage shows why. It brings aromas of cranberry and cherry that lead to ripe polished dark-fruit flavors. It's near irresistible and an exceptional value."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Other,Bodegas Fabre,15.0,90.0,"A compelling mix of cherry, plum and spicy aromas spell out Cabernet Sauvignon in block letters. This feels full, but also juicy, fresh and agile. Core berry flavors are lightly toasted and chocolaty, with coffee and lingering spice notes aiding a well-comported finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Deffends,15.0,90.0,"If any rosé can be serious, it's this. It has structure as well as fruit, a sense of purpose, ripe red fruits and tight acidity. It could even age, so wait to drink it until late in summer 2014."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Hawke's Bay,Mills Reef,15.0,90.0,"Despite originating from Hawkes Bay on New Zealand's North Island, this could pass for Marlborough. It's not overly big or ripe, but well-rounded without losing any sense of varietal character. Hints of tomato leaf and white grapefruit linger elegantly on the finish."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Verrière,15.0,90.0,"This is a tangy wine, packed with fruit, orange and lemon zest and a background hint of herbaceousness. A tight, steely texture gives both acidity and the promise of aging. Drink from early 2016."
Chardonnay,Israel,Galilee,Dalton,15.0,90.0,"Medium straw-colored in the glass, this wine offers aromas of orange blossom, white tea and seawater. There is a nice balance of smooth fruit and brightness, with flavors of ripe peach and pear that will cause a bit of a pucker on the side palate right into the lingering peach finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Companhia das Quintas,15.0,90.0,"Full-bodied and smooth, this wine has weight, richness and a dense, rounded texture. There's some good juiciness as well, adding dark berry fruits to the soft tannins and rounded feel of the wine. Acidity at the end brings a sense of balance. Drink from 2014."
Castelão,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,DFJ Vinhos,15.0,90.0,"The full juiciness of Castelão is balanced by spice and structure from wood maturation. The result is a smooth, textured wine, firm with tannins for aging. It is rich, smoky, dry and edgy at this young stage. Drink from 2016."
Saperavi,Georgia,Kakheti,Tbilvino,15.0,90.0,"Inky red-violet to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of blackberry with touches of pencil lead. There is a nice balance of brightness and smooth tannins, with flavors of blackberry, blueberry, vanilla and nutmeg. A unexpected splash of acidity perks up the persistent white chocolate finish."
Sauvignon,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Ronco Blanchis,15.0,90.0,"Fresh and elegant, this opens with lovely scents of elderberry flower, hay, tomato vine and citrus. The subtle, refined palate shows grapefruit, sage and lemon drop framed in crisp acidity. Energizing mineral backs up the finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Mas Carlot,15.0,90.0,"This blend of 55% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre shows considerable weight and richness for the price. Subtle garrigue shadings lead into dark flavors of black cherry, blackberry, cola and licorice, ending with hints of mocha and espresso. Drink it now–2017."
Rosé,US,New York,Osprey's Dominion,15.0,90.0,"Luscious raspberry and red-cherry flavors are concentrated in this bright, fruity rosé. Made predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, it's marked by bristles of bramble and herb that lend complexity to the palate. The finish is brisk and refreshingly saline."
Moschofilero,Greece,Mantinia,Tselepos,15.0,90.0,"This wine starts with a lovely perfumed nose of jasmine, oranges and rose. The full-bodied flavors are big to be sure, but a brisk acidity keeps everything in check. Pretty and full of personality."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine d'Eole,15.0,90.0,"Floral and fresh, but there's more to it than just a simple quaff. Watermelon and berry flavors are carried by a plump, medium-bodied palate, slightly oily texture and a long, mouthwatering finish."
Syrah,Chile,Maule Valley,Morandé,15.0,90.0,"Solid, deep and earthy smelling, with cola, mushroom, violet and tree bark aromas. The palate is smooth and balanced, with dark berry, baked plum, chocolate and spice flavors. Dry, foresty and healthy as can be on the finish. Exemplary for the price."
Chardonnay,Australia,South Australia,Chateau Reynella,15.0,90.0,"Unusually complex for a wine in this price range, marrying grilled peaches with hints of toasted hazelnut and bacon fat, and wrapped in a layer of cedary, vanilla-scented oak. Medium-bodied, with a long, subtly oaky finish."
Pinot Grigio,US,Washington,Julia's Dazzle,15.0,90.0,"Brief skin contact during fermentation gives this appropriately named, single-vineyard (The Benches) rosé it's pretty pale-salmon color. It's immediately appealing, with notes of melon and strawberry, and just a hair off-dry, with a rich, textured feel."
Riesling,US,Washington,Apex,15.0,90.0,"Aromatic and complex, this wine, though not quite bone dry, is tart and citrusy. The mixed fruit flavors run a spectrum from grapefruit to lemon candy to nectarine, lingering gracefully into a mineral-soaked finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,15.0,90.0,"In 2009 this single vineyard offering includes 11% Sémillon. It has wonderful texture, and a mix of light herbal flavors that run through a gamut from celery to lemongrass and up into tart citrus fruit. The acidity is generous but not searing; it penetrates but never overpowers. A quintessential food wine."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Pitray,15.0,90.0,"This ripe, fruity wine has soft tannins and a generous, warm character that makes it already drinkable. Better, however, to wait until its full potential is realized, from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Vieux Puit,15.0,90.0,"Packed with spicy black fruit, this is a solid, dense wine. It has acidity and a crisp edge, although this is more than balanced by the ripe black plum flavors and generous tannins. Drink from 2019."
Carmenère,Chile,Maule Valley,Calina,15.0,90.0,"The Calina label  seems to have hit its stride; this Carmenère opens with scents of black fruit, dill sprigs and chocolate. The palate broadens with olive, plum, blackberry and coffee flavors, and as a whole it comes together with a certain ease that announces it's on the money."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Wines & Winemakers,15.0,90.0,"There is something of the essential crispness and green fruit character of a Vinho Verde. But the wine also has some richness, weight, and a creamy texture. Very aromatic, this is a wine to drink and also age a few months."
Shiraz,Australia,New South Wales,Hope Estate,15.0,90.0,"This is already showing some evolution in its color, displaying some lightening at its rim. The aromas are floral and tea-like, with subtle cinnamon and spice shadings, and the flavors follow along, resembling Wild Berry Zinger tea. It's medium in weight, with silky tannins and a softly dusty finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Hahn,15.0,90.0,"A slightly herbal, minty character gives personality to this full-bodied, generous and richly textured wine. It is attractively dry, nicely tannic, layered with black cherry, wild berry and rosemary notes. Great to drink now through 2020 with rich meats or mushrooms."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Vinos de Arganza,15.0,90.0,"Jammy aromas of plum and berry are oaky and come with a hint of rubber and/or latex. This is weighty yet balanced. Earthy flavors of baked black fruits, tea and spice are slightly minerally, while the finish is oaky and generous, with a touch of menthol and heat."
Red Blend,US,Oregon,Abacela,15.0,90.0,"This blend of Tempranillo, Malbec, Dolcetto, Merlot and Syrah could have turned into a generic red, yet it is seamless and nicely proportioned. It's a real crowd-pleaser, with a ripe red-fruit flavor and generous new-barrel-derived toast and spice notes."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,A to Z,15.0,90.0,"Sometimes less is more, and sometimes more is more, as in this 68,000-case offering from A to Z. It's a leesy, pretty, highly gulpable wine, loaded with apple, pear and melon fruit. Hints of cucumber and stone add freshness to the lingering aftertaste."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Milbrandt,15.0,90.0,"Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea? It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point."
Merlot,US,California,Murphy-Goode,15.0,90.0,"Good fruit concentration and a velvety texture make this deeply colored, dry wine substantial enough for a special occasion. It smells like spicy oak and tastes like ripe black cherries and blackberries, with a smooth mouthfeel."
Chardonnay,US,California,Husch,15.0,90.0,"This wine is big and rich, with a lot of buttery, spicy oak showing in the aormas as well as the flavors, while it also brings out ripe pear, nutmeg and hazelnut accents. A toasty oak element and moderate acidity help to balance out the ripe fruit character."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Château Bianca,15.0,90.0,"Despite the low alcohol reading, this comes across as dry rather than off dry. Apple, pear and white peach anchor a just-ripe-enough wine with highlights of citrus oil. There's good length and focus throughout."
Merlot,US,California,J. Lohr,15.0,90.0,"This Merlot is dark in the glass, with lots of oak, vanilla and caramel aromas against a black-cherry and chocolate-cake backdrop on the nose. Soft and chalky tannins frame the sip, where blueberry, vanilla and chocolate-cream flavors prove lush and inviting."
Merlot,US,California,Bonterra,15.0,90.0,"On the big and bold side, this has abundant fruit flavors surrounded by equally abundant lip-smacking tannins, great acidity and a long finish. Not very oaky, it has a vibrancy and fruit focus that is mouthwatering and compelling. It's tasty now, but will also improve through 2017."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kremstal,Hermann Moser,15.0,90.0,"Crisply fruity, this is delicate, with clean lines of acidity. It shows delicious flavors of green apple and bitter orange, with a tangy, zesty texture. The finish is dry and taut. Screwcap."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,J. Portugal Ramos,15.0,90.0,"This is a dark and dense wine, serious with its firm tannins and solid black fruits. It has spice, blackberry and currant flavors, along with a pure line of acidity. With its firm structure, this dry, concentrated wine needs to age. Drink from 2015."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,15.0,90.0,"This succulent effort proves once again that a hot site can make excellent Riesling in Washington state. The Cold Creek signature minerality provides the base, and the fruit, vibrant and fresh, brings juicy acidity as well. The wine sails into a creamy finish that demands a glass refill."
Chenin Blanc,France,Loire Valley,Domaine de la Gaverie,15.0,90.0,"Lightly off dry, this rich, smooth wine has acidity to balance the honey and ripe pineapple flavors.

Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Weinviertel,R&A; Pfaffl,15.0,90.0,"Sleek green pear-scented ripeness is married to tender creaminess. Underneath the fruit, subtle yeast notes appear. Slender but flavorsome and easy, the wine offers lovely Grüner typicity and perfect balance."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta Le Calcinaie,15.0,90.0,"Delicately fragrant and floral, this luminous wine opens with aromas that recall yellow flowers and citrus blossoms.

It's balanced and linear, with mouthwatering acidity that creates a clean, lingering finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Barker's Marque,15.0,90.0,"Pungent and sweaty but nevertheless inviting, this is a walk on the wild side of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. It's full-on boxwood and passionfruit; a potent, weighty wine with a intensely feral quality. Drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Portuguese Table Wine,Sogrape,15.0,90.0,"This blend of wines from Dão, Bairrada and Lisboa is ripe, full of black fruits and with subtle signs of the wood aging. Named to celebrate the Portuguese mariners who sailed to the spice islands of the East Indies, it is warm with its own spiciness as well as a juicy aftertaste. Drink now."
Sangiovese,Italy,Central Italy,Tre Monti,15.0,90.0,"Made with organically grown Sangiovese grapes and without added sulfites, this offers aromas of blackberry, black tea and thyme. The juicy savory palate tastes of blackberry jam, raspberry and clove framed in smooth, supple tannins and fresh acidity. Drink soon to enjoy the succulent fruit flavors."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Houchart,15.0,90.0,"This is a really fruity, attractive wine from a fine estate. It is crisp with delicious acidity and a lively texture that gives the wine a refreshing tang. The wine is up front, full of fruitiness and ready to drink."
Riesling,US,New York,Dr. Konstantin Frank,15.0,90.0,"The historic Dr. Konstantin Frank winery has long been a source for consistent, well-priced wines in the Finger Lakes. Pretty on the nose, with delicate floral and stone-fruit aromas, it builds in intensity and power on the palate, with a crush of sweet-tart grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Hints of fresh herb, honeycomb and zippy lemon-lime acidity add nuance and balance to a long finish."
Rosé,US,California,Benziger,15.0,90.0,"This lovely rosé is made from certified sustainable grapes of indeterminate variety. Slightly effervescent in tart cherry and mint, there's a textured, complex layering of strawberry and raspberry in the mix that makes the wine bright and refreshing."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Badia a Coltibuono,15.0,90.0,"Dark berry, pressed violet, toast and a whiff of espresso lead the nose of this savory, easy-drinking red. The ripe, round palate delivers juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, clove and mocha. It's already extremely accessible, with supple tannins."
Red Blend,South Africa,Western Cape,Neil Ellis,15.0,90.0,"Soft oak and sweet-spice aromas add interest to the rich berry core of this red blend. Notes of raspberry and strawberry fill the medium-weight mouth, framed by soft yet present tannins and spicy hints of licorice and black pepper that linger through the finish. Harmonious and attractive, this is ready to drink now."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Franklin Tate,15.0,90.0,"This is a pretty lean, tightly focused wine. Grilled pineapple and citrus notes broaden slightly on the midpalate, then come together again on the crisp, lemony finish. Drink now through the end of 2015."
Gewürztraminer,Germany,Rheinhessen,Leonard Kreusch,15.0,90.0,"Hints of sugar cookie and tangerine entice on the nose of this bold, bang-for-your-buck Gewürztraminer. Off dry and voluminous in style, it's full of rich, penetrating grapefruit flavor edged with bitter lime pith. The finish is long and sleek."
Red Blend,Spain,Central Spain,Finca Constancia,15.0,90.0,"Aromas of rubber, coffee, lemon peel and cherry are good but lack some cohesion. This Cabernet Franc-Syrah-Garnacha blend feels lively and fresh, but also choppy and tannic. Dark blackened flavors of cassis and black cherry finish toasty and peppery with a gamy accent."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,J. Heinrich,15.0,90.0,"Ripe bramble and blackberry vie for attention on the nose. The palate is light and has lots of energy, verve and more fresh-faced fruit. This is just about medium-bodied and offers us an uncomplicated but delicious and refreshing interpretation of Blaufränkisch."
Red Blend,US,America,Sokol Blosser,15.0,90.0,"Following in the footsteps of the Evolution White, this nonvintage blend is labeled by edition, as the mix of grapes does change from release to release. Here the base wine is Syrah, amended with a paintbox of both red and white grapes. It's aromatic and unique, silky smooth and loaded with pretty plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel is luscious, the flavors beautifully blended, and the overall quality superb."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Clos Mont-Blanc,15.0,90.0,"This is extremely fruity, with an exotic bouquet of blueberry, cardamom, nutmeg and earth aromas. It feels smooth, collected and fairly rich, with savory, lightly baked flavors of black fruit. The finish remains savory, where graham cracker sweetness and roasted qualities dominate."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Lavradores de Feitoria,15.0,90.0,"There are powerful tannins at work here. The wine has structure, a solid and firm texture and strong black currant flavors. It's still young, showing a dry, mineral edge that will need to warm up before it's ready. Drink from 2017."
Rhône-style Red Blend,US,California,Bridlewood,15.0,90.0,"This savory blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah and Viognier (developed, Bridlewood claims, after tasting through the winery's lots 175 times) delivers black pepper, vanilla, stewed fig and roasted pork to the nose. It then clings to flavors like sage and sautéed plum that are more often found in cool-climate Syrah. The tannins are slightly rough, so this may be best in 2015, but it's drinking well now."
Vermentino,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Vigne Surrau,15.0,90.0,"Here's a savory, medium-bodied white that delivers aromas and flavors of yellow flower, ripe yellow apple, juicy peach, lemon zest and flint. An almond note backs up the finish while modest acidity provides balance."
Riesling,US,New York,Dr. Konstantin Frank,15.0,90.0,Bright mango and pineapple tones are cut by laser-sharp edges of lime in this delicately structured dry Riesling. Invigorating white grapefruit and a steely sensation gild a lingering finish.
Chardonnay,US,California,Amici,15.0,90.0,"This white is a study in unexpected complexity and pleasure. Quince, sulfur and grapefruit notes define it best, as supple minerality and gravelly texture provide dimensionality."
Chardonnay,Australia,Western Australia,Xanadu,15.0,90.0,"Boasts plenty of buttery tropical fruit set off by aromas of toast and smoke, then shines in the mouth, where the mouthfeel is custardy but not heavy and the fruit flavors shine. Finishes long and tart, seamlessly turning citrusy along the way."
Red Blend,US,California,Chronic Cellars,15.0,90.0,"This blend of 77% Zinfandel, 14% Syrah, 8% Petite Sirah and 1% Grenache is a solid choice at this price. Vibrant fruit tones of strawberry, cranberry, black raspberry and mulberry mix with exotic vanilla and clove on the nose. Juicy and fresh flavors of pine-smoked blackberries give a peat-like character to the palate."
Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Kirkland Signature,15.0,90.0,"Made by major Chablis producer Jean-Marc Brocard, this wine is ripe, soft and attractively fruity. It has crisp acidity along with rich yellow fruits and a touch of minerality. The wine comes from a blend of different premier cru vineyards. Delicious and refreshing, it is ready to drink now."
Glera,Italy,Veneto,Spagnol,15.0,90.0,"Delicate, enticing scents of white stone fruit and spring flower drift out of the glass. Bright and creamy, the refreshing palate doles out green apple, white peach and lemon zest set against lively acidity and a silky mousse."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Jones of Washington,15.0,90.0,"The fruit flavors of apples and dried apricots are enhanced with notes of toasted walnuts and sweet grain. Made from estate-grown Chardonnay, this is lush and fruity, with complex detailing from having fermented in Hungarian oak puncheons."
Viognier,US,Washington,Jones of Washington,15.0,90.0,"A candied citrus flavor marks this fresh, bracing, barrel-fermented Viognier from the estate vineyards. Despite low alcohol and a hint of sweetness, it retains a crisp minerality, with a finishing lick of lime rind."
Shiraz,Israel,Galilee,Recanati,15.0,90.0,"Scents of licorice root, bramble and a soft menthol note grace this balanced Shiraz's black cherry, raspberry and boysenberry fruit. This is medium weight, with moderate tannins and an approachable structure. A note of roasted espresso bean and a hint of chicory carry through the long finish. Mevushal."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,15.0,90.0,"Scents of fresh apple and pear are accented with touches of wax and mineral on this nuanced, dry Riesling. The palate feels lush and fruity with ripe peach and pear flavors, but zesty lime acidity and a shower of minerality lend stately elegance. A surprisingly bold wine for a diminutive price. Drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,15.0,90.0,"While aromatically subdued with delicate notes of lemon, lime and minerals, a streak of honey builds throughout this medium-sweet wine. It adds decadence to sweet, ripe flavors of pear, apple and hibiscus nectar on the palate. It's tasty, bright and penetrating."
Furmint,Austria,Burgenland,Gunter Triebaumer,15.0,90.0,"This wine's nose barely hints at ripe apple and white pepper, but the palate sings with aromas and flavors: fresh lemon, ripe and juicy red apple and a slightly herbal, grassy touch. All of this appears on a delicate, light-bodied frame enlivened by zesty acidity. The finish is long, intriguing and dry."
St. Laurent,Austria,Burgenland,Artisan Wines DI Franz Scheider,15.0,90.0,"This wine hits the nose with red cherry vibrancy. That almost dramatic fruit also fills the palate with its easy juiciness. This may be simple and light, but its absolute fruitiness makes it great for summer sipping, especially with a slight chill."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Pinhal da Torre,15.0,90.0,"Syrah meets two Portuguese grapes in this rich and ripe wine, smoothing out the tannins of the Touriga Nacional in the blend. It has black fruits that are broad and dense along with juicy acidity. Drink the wine now."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Cave du Marmandais,15.0,90.0,"The vineyards of Marmande are on the north bank of the Garonne River, east of Bordeaux.

The aftertaste with its acidity is fresh and fruity. Drink from 2018."
Tannat,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,15.0,90.0,"Celebrating both the wide beret worn by Gascon men and the local Tannat grape, this firm wine is rich and concentrated.

Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Tapiz,15.0,90.0,"Solid as a boulder and concentrated on the bouquet, with a mix of floral, fine perfume and blackberry aromas. Feels lush, complete and easygoing, with blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Graceful and composed on the back end."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Foris,15.0,90.0,"This fruity and forward wine delivers fresh and juicy orange flavors, along with light touches of citrus peel and pith. It strikes the perfect balance between fruit, acidity and sugar and is best when slightly chilled."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Lake Chalice,15.0,90.0,"This combines bold fruit flavors reminiscent of peach or nectarine with leafy, herbal notes.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Real Companhia Velha,15.0,90.0,"Big and ripe wine with sweet, jammy black fruits layered with new wood. The wine is powerful, to be sure, but it also has a stylish elegance from the interplay of fruit acidity and tannins."

Red Blend,Italy,Tuscany,Tenuta di Capraia,15.0,90.0,"Here's a charming, savory blend of Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo and Colorino that opens with aromas of red berry, violet and a whiff of sweet cake spice. The bright, juicy palate offers crunchy red berry, cinnamon, anise and orange zest while lithe tannins and fresh acidity offer support. Easy drinking and delicious, it's made for sheer drinking pleasure. Drink through 2018."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Walnut City WineWorks,15.0,90.0,"All-stainless fermented, this flavorful Pinot Gris displays fleshy, ripe pear flavors, with a light dusting of cinnamon spice. Simply delicious, and ready right now."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Schäfer,15.0,90.0,"Dusty rose-petal potpourri and mineral notes accent sweet, concentrated grapefruit and honey flavors in this perky bargain auslese. Semisweet in style, it's approachable and juicy, yet remarkably elegant and persistent."
Sangiovese,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,15.0,90.0,"Deep garnet to the eye, this wine offers fragrances of black cherry, cranberry and espresso. A net of soft tannins plays host to flavors of strawberry, cherry, white chocolate and Thai basil. The finish is a balancing act between smooth and bright sensations on the palate."
Sauvignon Blanc,Israel,Shomron,Recanati,15.0,90.0,"A nose of lemon and apple with the scent of slightly feral brambles leads to flavors of lemon, guava, passion fruit, pineapple and rose petal. This is a grownup Sauvignon Blanc that feels nice on the palate, with a finish that is equal amounts spicy, savory and bright."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,New South Wales,McWilliam's,15.0,90.0,"The Hilltops is a high-altitude (approximately 450 meters above sea level), continental region that's often a good source for value. This wine is crisp, youthful and firm, with hints of baking spices and vanilla accenting pure cassis fruit. Drink 2020–2030."
Rosé,US,Oregon,Quady North,15.0,90.0,"This is a GSM rosé, loaded with watermelon and strawberry fruit, and sporting a slightly dusty mouthfeel. The persistent finish and texture keep it interesting all the way through."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,15.0,90.0,"Round and welcoming up front, with toffee, caramel and mocha aromas that are not too sharp. Feels smooth, with pure flavors of toasted nuts, caramel, cocoa dust, dried apricot and underripe peach. Complex and nutty on the finish, with a sweet aftertaste of chocolate and toffee."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Adega Cooperativa de Borba,15.0,90.0,The wine is dark and dense although with a sense of freshness provided by the blackberry fruit. There are spices from the wood aging and firm dry tannins. It is a concentrated wine that will be better to drink from 2017.
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Kamptal,Loimer,15.0,90.0,"A little bit of green pear, a little bit of pepper and quite a bit of juiciness add up to a whole lot of easy-drinking fun on this light, dry and zippy Grüner. There's some spice and yeastiness around the edges, too. Drink soon."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Barbeiranne,15.0,90.0,"Produced from 40-year-old vines, this wine is ripe, full of red fruits with good concentration. It is packed with crisp acidity and lively fruitiness, making it refreshing and drinkable. The lees aging before bottling has added extra depth to the flavors. Drink now."
Sauvignon Blanc,South Africa,Constantia,Buitenverwachting,15.0,90.0,"Solid aromas of white peach, gooseberry, sweet grass and lime leaf lead the bouquet of this charming wine. The medium-weight palate is cut by ample acidity, leading with ripe fruit flavors that transition to notes of pear skin and subtle gingery spice on the close. It's well balanced and offers good evolution through the sip. Drink now–2019."
Chardonnay,US,New York,Lamoreaux Landing,15.0,90.0,"Pretty white floral and peach notes perfume this fresh, fruity unoaked Chardonnay. While lush and rounded on the palate, it balances bright honeydew and yellow cherry flavors against a backdrop of crisp acidity."
Ondenc,France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,15.0,90.0,"The Ondenc ranks high on the list of rare or neglected grape varieties. The wine forms part of a new range from this producer. Found in small quantities throughout the southwest but mainly in Gaillac, it has produced a pale gold colored wine, softly spoken and with light tangy acidity. There is a hint of honey in this fine wine, although it is dry. Drink now."
Riesling,US,New York,Anthony Road,15.0,90.0,"Elegant peach and floral tones on this off-dry Riesling build in complexity on the nose and palate, with layers of waxy lanolin and fresh green herbs. It's forward and fruity, yet honed and balanced, with bright lemon-lime acidity."
Pinot Gris,US,California,Boeger,15.0,90.0,"This distinctive wine has a slightly peachy color, which is natural for this varietal. Aromas suggest white pepper and orange zest, while flavors recall peach skin and apricot. A nervy, crisp balance makes it feel lively and refreshing on the tongue, despite full body."
Rosé,US,California,Carol Shelton,15.0,90.0,"A color so deep it could be a Pinot Noir, flavors bursting with plum and wild blackberry and a velvety texture make this dry rosé taste more like a red. Bucking the trend toward lightness, it has medium body, a creamy mouthfeel and lingering finish."
Cabernet Franc,Chile,Curicó Valley,Junta,15.0,90.0,"A robust nose with cherry and plum aromas is also savory, saucy and spicy. There's nothing shy about this Cab Franc's sinewy, acidic palate, while spiced berry flavors extend onto a long, aggressive finish."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Bodegas Eidosela,15.0,90.0,"Lime and grapefruit aromas are a touch pithy and feline but don't go overboard. Citrusy and minerally on the palate, this tastes of lime, green melon and green banana. A pure, tangy finish holds firm."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Portuguese Table Wine,Sogrape,15.0,90.0,"Celebrating the Portuguese discovery of the spice route, this blend from different regions is smooth, rich and ripe. It has tannins that enhance the ripe black fruits and bring out the spicy edge to the wine. It is ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,New Zealand,Marlborough,Ara,15.0,90.0,"One of the more characterful Pinot Gris for this price, Ara's 2013 offers wet stone and apple aromas, flavors of apple, cinnamon and pear and a long, mouthwatering finish. There's a bit of creaminess on the midpalate and just a hint of dusty texture on the finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,J. Lohr,14.0,90.0,"This very approachable and likable wine puts the typical dried-grass aromas atop stone fruit scents. The palate is very herb-tinged, with parsley, thyme and rosemary finding a nice symbiosis with the riper nectarine and melon flesh."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Murphy-Goode,14.0,90.0,"Fresh aromas, vivid citrus flavors, elegance and poise make this an attractive wine. It has a balance that is easy to enjoy and keeps calling for more sips, with pleasant notes of citrus and green fruit throughout."
Rosé,France,Provence,Ravoire et Fils,14.0,90.0,"The 20% of Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives structure, although a perfumed character dominates. This refreshing wine has pine and rosemary flavors as well as red fruits. It is ripe and concentrated, with intense acidity at the end."
Red Blend,US,California,Marietta Cellars,14.0,90.0,"It's great to return to an excellent honest-tasting fruit-driven wine that has very good balance, an appetizing texture thanks to fine-grained tannins and light spicy elements to complement the pure cherry and berry core. It's the kind of wine that doesn't get tiring, and will be ideal to stock up on."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Fire Road,14.0,90.0,"Winemaker Alana McGettigan is an associate of Matt Thomson (Saint Clair, Delta), so it's no surprise this Sauvignon Blanc overdelivers. Hints of tomato leaf garnish passion fruit and citrus flavors in this wine, which reveals a certain amount of austerity and restraint on the palate, a silky texture and a long, grapefruit-driven finish."
Pinot Noir,US,New York,Dr. Konstantin Frank,14.0,90.0,"Ripe cherry and luscious watermelon aromas waft from this summery, fresh wine. It's dry on the palate but concentrated, with bright cherry and berry flavors. Round and lush yet briskly balanced, it's a great summer quaffer at a fantastic price."
Chardonnay,Bulgaria,Danube River Plains,Chateau Burgozone,14.0,90.0,"A clean nose of lemon curd sets the scene for flavors of kumquat, green apple, ripe mango and lemon zest. Medium bodied on the palate, this wine offers a bright, crisp finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château la Verrière,14.0,90.0,"This complex, spicy and fruity wine is big, with attractive acidity. It is piled with berry fruits that give a rich character. The fruits are supported by well-judged wood. This full-bodied wine will develop well; drink from 2017."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Deer Creek,14.0,90.0,"There has been an impressive jump in quality over the past few vintages, along with a price drop. What's not to like? This young, lightly spritzy wine is a fresh summer drink with immense appeal. Scents of white flowers, flavors of pears and highlights of tangerines, continue into further flavors of pink grapefruit and clean rock. The low alcohol suggests that there is a touch of residual sugar, but the wine finishes dry."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,14.0,90.0,"This intensely fruity wine is full of crisp acidity, lemon and lime flavors and a tangy, tight, steely texture. The wine is mineral and structured, while remaining fresh and attractively juicy. It's tempting to drink it now because of the freshness, but better wait until 2016."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Dr. Volkmar,14.0,90.0,"Lines of dusty chalk lend an elegant mineral vibe to this richly fruity, blossomy wine. The palate is luscious and ripe, boasting dense white peach and apricot flavors, but anchored by a zesty backbone of acidity. It's fruit-forward and accessible, yet remarkably elegant."
Chardonnay,US,California,Korbel,14.0,90.0,"This could be considered a liquid dessert, with a rich gold color, abundant aromas of baked apple and pear tart, and tasty vanilla and marzipan flavors. But with 1% dosage it's not overly sweet, just very lush in texture, concentrated in flavor and long on the finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Dão,Casa da Passarella,14.0,90.0,"With creamy Encruzado and perfumed Malvasia in the blend, this is a deliciously full-bodied wine. There is a smoky character as well as a creamy texture. The wine is young and fruity but ready to drink, although it will be better from 2018."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Marsan,14.0,90.0,"This wine is all about fresh fruit and refreshing acidity. Crisp citrus, green apples and a touch of apricot give a fruitiness contained with a steel and mineral texture. It is full of acidity while keeping a riper, fruity character. Drink from late 2015."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Lavau,14.0,90.0,"This revitalized négociant has bottled a fine rosé that's showing its best in 2015. It's deep pink in color, with perfumed aromas of rose petals and cracked pepper. It's ample in body, picking up hints of cardamom, cinnamon, watermelon and red berries on the palate, before finishing long and refreshing. Drink now."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Francis Ford Coppola,14.0,90.0,"The personality of Pinot Noir comes through in this charming, medium-bodied, lighter-colored and aromatic offering. Nuances are reminiscent of cherry, herb and walking through a pine forest, along with a tangy texture and fresh finish that lingers."
Zinfandel,US,California,Rosenblum,14.0,90.0,"This old favorite has an excellent new release. A classic style of Zin, it surrounds generous fruit and spice flavors with a firm texture and appetizing tannins. It starts with light black pepper and sage aromas to complement the rich blackberry and raspberry fruit, and finishes with lingering nuances of spice and berry."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Cognettes,14.0,90.0,"This wine is ripe and full of attractive fruit. With a light touch of pepper as well as rich apples, it is shot through with acidity. Full in the mouth, it finishes with taut minerality."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Parducci,14.0,90.0,"Dark, rich and full bodied, this wine has great structure and bold, tasty flavors like boysenberry and blackberry. It feels firm and tannic on the palate, but without overdoing it. Generous fruit flavors linger on the finish."
White Blend,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,14.0,90.0,"Refreshing from the first whiff of green apple, fuchsia, and almond blossom, it has flavors of peach, eucalyptus, green apple, and white flowers. Harmonious tannins persist to the bright note of the vanilla custard and orange zest finish, undercut by strong minerality."
Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Upland Estates,14.0,90.0,"Sassy, spicy, and sporting both floral and sweet citrus characteristics, this off-dry Gewurztraminer fills the mouth with candied lemon, sweet papaya and a squirt of fresh lime. Very tasty, with a lingering, refreshing finish."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Château de Nages,14.0,90.0,"An excellent value, Gassier's 2010 Réserve from his Château de Nages blends 60% Grenache with 40% Syrah. The result is a wine that combines leathery, cedary notes with touches of spice and red fruit. It's supple, creamy and inviting, with a long, softly tannic finish. Drink now and for 3–4 years."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château du Juge,14.0,90.0,"A solid, fruity wine supported by ripe tannins. The wine has a good sense of its rich self, a fine presence of ripe plum fruit flavors and a warm texture. There is a fine juicy aftertaste."
Sangiovese,Italy,Tuscany,Pratesi,14.0,90.0,"Made with Sangiovese, Locorosso has an intense fragrance of wild cherry and underbrush accented by tobacco and spice. The palate is dense and delicious, delivering black cherry layered with carob, coffee and white pepper notes. It's already enjoyable so drink soon."
Touriga Nacional,Portugal,Beiras,Caves Aliança,14.0,90.0,"With many characteristics of the granite-soil based Dão, this is a dense, mineral and dark fruited wine. It has blackberry and plum-skin fruits as well as a firm, tannic core. Even though it's tightly structured now, it is drinkable, but would benefit from another year's aging."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Foris,14.0,90.0,"The aromatic intensity takes you quickly to the signature heart of the grape. It's floral and spicy, leading to concentrated flavors of citrus and stone fruits. It's ripe, dry and penetrating."
Tinta Cao,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,14.0,90.0,"It is unusual to find a 100% Tinta Cão because (in regional slang) this vine is a dog to manage due to its wild vigorous nature. The wine with its tight tannins and layers of mint from the wood aging is dense and concentrated if also peppery and very powerful. It works well in the warm Alentejo region, giving a dark firm wine that is ready to drink."
Red Blend,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,K Cellars,14.0,90.0,"Aromas of black raspberry, dried cherry, espresso and smoked meat set the scene for mouth-pleasing flavors of black cherry, blackberry and tobacco leaf. Harmonious levels of tannins and acidity linger on the tongue at the conclusion of the juicy, fruit-filled finish."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Red Knot,14.0,90.0,"For the price, this offers much more depth and structure than expected. Dark berry fruit, vanilla and cedar mark the nose, while there's plenty of weight and richness on the palate. Drink now–2025."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Wairau Valley,Wither Hills,14.0,90.0,"For the price, this is remarkably concentrated, with ample weight and intense flavors. It's more subdued on the nose, offering just hints of stuck flint and grapefruit, but the citrusy flavors surge forward, culminating in a long, grapefruity finish."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château Beaulieu,14.0,90.0,"A full, rounded wine, very much a rosé for food. It is bone dry in character, although the berry fruitiness gives the wine an attractive open feel. With its firm texture, it could age a year."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Israel,Galilee,Segal's,14.0,90.0,"A bouquet of blueberry, pomegranate and juniper berry braces the palate for flavors of blueberry, raspberry, anise, juniper berry and eucalyptus that sit in a plexus of comforting tannins. Fruity and cool flavors battle it out for dominance, with fruit remaining victorious on the bright and juicy finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Perescuma,14.0,90.0,"This is a dense wine from the Perescuma estate in the southeast Alentejo. It is going to take a while to mature. At the moment, tannins dominate the potential of the black fruits. Oak aging has given this wine extra depth. It's going to be a fine wine, but needs time. Drink from 2018."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Osborne,14.0,90.0,"Sweet and plump in the nose, with a hint of caramel corn, burnt sugar and char. Flavors of walnuts, dried apricots and citrus peel carry the palate, while the lasting and tasty finish delivers the works in terms of toffee, mocha and raisins. More fruity than many, with a touch of mushroom."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Viento,14.0,90.0,"This is winemaker Rich Cushman's estate vineyard. At 25 years of age, it may well be the oldest Riesling planting in the region. The alcohol is just under 11%, but there is plenty of acid under the fruit, so despite its off-dry designation, this is a wine that would work wonderfully well with a wide variety of cheeses and appetizers. Flavors suggest pears and peaches, detailed with spice and stone."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta Seara d'Ordens,14.0,90.0,"From an estate in the far west of the Cima Corgo region, close to Regua, this wine is structured and deliciously ripe in black fruits. It has a solid base of tannins that is allied to perfumed acidity and a hint of wood aging. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,US,California,Fossil Point,14.0,90.0,"A rewarding deal from the ocean-influenced vineyards of Edna Valley, this project by Nathan Carlson (general manager of the much higher-priced Center of Effort winery) delivers honey, salted nuts, tangerine zest and crushed limestone on the nose. Salinity is present on the palate, along with a lemon zing that lingers."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Burgenland,Hillinger,14.0,90.0,"Restrained notes of ripe pear gain savory interest from herbal notes reminiscent of curry leaf and lovage. There's also ample spice in this eminently gastronomic wine with a refreshing, super-clean finish."
Pinot Grigio,US,Washington,Wind Rose,14.0,90.0,"This is a well-made, delicately floral style of Pinot Grigio, with notes of apple blossoms, crisp tree fruits and bracing minerals that add length and texture."
Riesling,US,New York,Heron Hill,14.0,90.0,"A hint of pine fronds lends a cool, alpine touch to tart white peach and pineapple flavors in this vivacious dry Riesling. Zesty acidity enlivens the midpalate and extends out the finish. Drink now–2017."
Pinot Noir,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Bulgariana,14.0,90.0,"Garnet to the eye, this wine has a nose of black cherry, pomegranate, white chocolate and cigar box. Flavors of cherry and pipe tobacco with a hint of freshly zested orange wrapped in soft tannins remain on the palate through the final notes of chocolate-covered espresso bean."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Kings Ridge,14.0,90.0,"Lightly tawny in color, with a fresh and enlivening mouthfeel, this is a good Pinot Gris for salmon, halibut or even swordfish. Pear flesh and skin, white peach and a hint of spice are all in play."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie,14.0,90.0,"This is a rich, juicy, solid wine. The tannins of the Tannat have been mitigated by the more juicy Cabernets in the blend to give a structured while fruity wine. The black fruits and the intense acidity promise aging. Drink from 2018."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,9 Mile Road,14.0,90.0,"Don't expect explosive fruit from this wine. It delivers a pungent, spicy mix of cola, roasted meat and black olives instead, cushioned by ample weight in the mouth and a broad, creamy texture. Drink now–2020."
Rosé,France,Rhône Valley,Maison Denuzière,14.0,90.0,"This orange-tinted, medium-pink rosé is a blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 10% Grenache Blanc. It's medium in weight, with understated cherry-berry fruit balanced by the suggestion of wet stone. Drink now."
Pinot Gris,US,Washington,Nine Hats,14.0,90.0,It's rare to see a vineyard-designated bottle of Pinot Gris from the state. This one brings light aromas of apple and pear that are followed by dry fleshy fruit flavors. It hits all the right notes.
Fumé Blanc,US,California,Dry Creek Vineyard,14.0,90.0,"The wine that started it all for the producer, first bottled in 1972, this was 100% stainless-steel fermented and drips in fruity citrus. Lemon pith continues the theme, accented by notes of pineapple salsa and crisp green apple, remaining vibrant and fresh throughout."
Rosé,US,New York,Inspire Moore,14.0,90.0,Blaufränkisch's characteristic briar and blackberry tones shine brightly in this rather substantial rosé. Demure whispers of cherry blossom and fresh herb on the nose meld into smoky black fruit and bramble tones on the palate. It's refreshingly crisp but finishes with persistence.
Riesling,US,Washington,Gård,14.0,90.0,"Bone dry and concentrated, it was fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral oak. Lush floral and citrus aromatics carry over into the flavors, with a streak of Curaçao liqueur as well."
Red Blend,France,Provence,Domaine Houchart,14.0,90.0,"With really ripe fruit and juicy black flavors, this is a rounded, warm wine. It tastes of sun, although there is also something more seriously structured about it. Acidity gives freshness, while the tannic structure suggests further aging. Drink now, but better in 2015."
Zweigelt,Austria,Austria,Biokult,14.0,90.0,"Fresh citrus notes make this beautiful rosé smell like a zesty white wine. The palate, however, adds the fresh delight of ripe strawberry fruit. This adds up to a refreshing, superdry and elegant but fruitful pink summer wine."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Carl Graff,14.0,90.0,"There's plenty of marmalade and preserved-peach sweetness here, but it's calibrated deftly by pulsating acidity on the midpalate. It's delicate and dancing in mouthfeel, but the stalwart finish impresses. Drink now through 2019."
Tannat-Cabernet Franc,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,14.0,90.0,"This wine is already finely balanced, full of a combination of black fruits and acidity. Behind this fruitiness there are solid tannins, a dry core and a concentrated aftertaste where the Tannat shows well. Drink this ripe, full-bodied wine now."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Bulgariana,14.0,90.0,"This wine features aromas of raspberry and black currants with touches of coffee and bacon. Luxurious flavors of ripe black plum, black cherry, espresso and pipe tobacco wash over the taste buds in a web of velvety tannins, culminating in a vivid finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Bulgaria,Danube River Plains,Chateau Burgozone,14.0,90.0,"Deep ruby in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, raspberry, saddle leather and vanilla. It offers flavors of blackberry, black plum and fresh forest mushroom suspended in a cloud-like structure of silky tannins."
Pinot Noir,Bulgaria,Danube River Plains,Chateau Burgozone,14.0,90.0,"Dark ruby in the glass, this Pinot Noir from Bulgaria's Danube Plain entices the palate with the aroma of fresh-from-the-oven cherry pie. Flavors of cherry and vanilla with soft undertones of baking spices wash over the tongue, with pleasing notes of candied orange peel on the finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Foris,14.0,90.0,"Foris consistently produces a meticulously crafted, value lineup of Alsatian-inspired white wines. As with its siblings, this is crisp, detailed and balanced. Apple and pear fruit is lined with citrus rind. Give it a light chill and it will delight."
Riesling,France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,14.0,90.0,"Earthy notes and yeasty richness swing along the aromatic lemon bouquet. On the very slight, slender palate these flavors appear linear and leave a feeling of near weightlessness. Savory tones of yeast make themselves felt on the long, gossamer finish."
Moscato,US,California,Quady,14.0,90.0,"A heady mix of jasmine and orange rind, Quady's Electra packs a lot of flavor into a light amount of alcohol, with residual sugar listed at 172.4 g/L. Slightly effervescent, it's subtle and light, ready to serve as a happy mixer in a range of cocktails, much the way an elderflower liqueur might work."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Husch,14.0,90.0,"As good as last year, this vintage has a subtle lemon taste that's layered with dashes of lilting lychee and fresh cantaloupe. Well integrated and pleasant, it will pair with spicy and seafood-infused foods, or go down easy on its own."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Barnard Griffin,14.0,90.0,"Another jazzy, Best Buy winner from Barnard Griffin, this 2011 Chardonnay should be sipped to the tune of Harry Nilsson's “Put The Lime In The Coconut,” which neatly captures the flavors. Complex fruits, including apples, citrus—and yes, coconut—add up to a wine both sleek and satisfying, with toasted almonds rounding out the finish."
Red Blend,US,California,Barbed Wire,14.0,90.0,"Smoky, oaky aromas and flavors make a big impact as this medium-bodied wine floods the mouth with ripe fruit, black pepper and grilled meat flavors. But it keeps its composure, not pouring on too much alcohol or tannin."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Rainstorm,14.0,90.0,"Spicy and intense, this excellent Pinot Gris is loaded with Gravenstein apple, cut pear, and a taste of orange peel. Surprising length and power for a Euro-styled wine with modest alcohol."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Kings Ridge,14.0,90.0,"This outstanding Riesling brings a bouquet of rose petals and peaches. There's enough bright acidity to push flavors of lime and grapefruit forward, and the wine drinks dry despite relatively low alcohol."
Chardonnay,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Viu Manent,14.0,90.0,"For a first effort from Casablanca, Viu Manent has hit a home run. This wine is a classic New World Chard, meaning it's liberally oaked, vibrant, ripe and full of tropical fruit. But along with the obvious there are also notes of cinnamon, mineral, exotic apple and butterscotch. Imported by Baystate Wine Co."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Spindrift Cellars,14.0,90.0,"Loaded with flavors of fresh Bartlett pears, this excellent Pinot Gris has both flavor and texture to spare. It's a fine expression of the Oregon style; clean and fruit-driven, forward and juicy, with a broad midpalate and crisp natural acids."
Pinot Blanc,US,Oregon,Erath,14.0,90.0,"This has a creamy consistency, and flavors of lemon custard and vanilla-cream. There is a dash of baking spices as well, but the fruit flavors are front and center."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,Washington,Pamplin,14.0,90.0,"This wine comes from top sites Canoe Ridge Estate, Champoux, Seven Hills and Wallula. An intriguing blend of 43% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Petit Verdot and 17% Malbec, it offers high-toned aromas, with notes of toasty spice and herb in front of raspberry and cherry. Supple and well balanced, the fruit flavors show poise and length."
Red Blend,US,California,Red Rock,14.0,90.0,"This extroverted and very yummy wine is dark and deep in color. It smells like it's drenched in blackberry jam and tastes almost as thick. Gobs of boysenberry and blackberry flavors carry hints of chocolate and cherry. It's not too full bodied, just full flavored."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Pieropan,14.0,90.0,"Aromas of ripe pears and peaches jump out of the glass, and the flavors follow suit, bouncing across the palate in a display of stone fruits. It's relatively full bodied, but a garnish of grapefruit zest on the finish keeps it balanced and lively. Best Buy."
Sparkling Blend,US,California,Korbel,14.0,90.0,"This has a pale salmon color and aromas like those of Pinot Noir, including the walk-in-the-forest smell. Crisp cherry flavors lead to an intriguing mushroom note on the finish. Nearly dry, the texture is plush and soothing, while the finish is soft and lingering."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Mouchão,14.0,90.0,"This is a smooth, wood aged wine that comes from the Mouchão estate. It has rich red fruits, finely integrated tannins and a solid structure. It has an open, generous feel to it, given shape and aging potential by the dry core and fruity acidity. Drink from 2015."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Anselmo Mendes,14.0,90.0,"This is a deliciously fresh, yet also rounded and rich wine. Creamed apples and soft pears go with a lime juice crispness, resulting in a wine that is ripe, fruity and delicately acidic. Drink now."
Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,E. Guigal,14.0,90.0,"A noteworthy effort made in widely available commercial quantities, Guigal's '07 CdR Blanc offers scents of pineapple and pear, flavors that include hints of white chocolate, a reasonably rich mouthfeel and a long, dry, concentrated finish with just a hint of honey."
Tannat-Cabernet,France,Southwest France,Château Peyros,14.0,90.0,"Certainly tannic but at the same time richly black fruited. This is solid, chunky, with plum and sweet fig fruits, lining a bitter chocolate and dark tannin outer shell. For aging over several years."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Massimo Daldin,14.0,90.0,"Aged for six months in casks, this focused white opens with a pretty fragrance of white blossom, Anjou pear and dried herb. The polished, structured palate boasts an impressive depth of flavors, including green apple, nectarine, peach and a touch of crystalized ginger alongside a vein of mineral. Bright acidity gives it a crisp finish while an almond note signals the close."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Foris,14.0,90.0,"Labeled dry and tasting very much so, this clean, floral-scented Gewürztraminer has a pleasingly dusty aspect; rose petals with a thin veneer of incense. Long and complex."
Pinot Gris,US,New York,Lakewood,14.0,90.0,"Whiffs of orange blossom and lemon rind lend vibrancy to this rich, luxuriously textured Pinot Gris. Just off dry in style, it bursts with flavors of white peach showered in grapefruit acidity. Luscious and irresistibly clingy, it lingers long on the palate."
Pinot Noir,France,Alsace,Willm,14.0,90.0,"This is a deliciously ripe, full-bodied wine with all the red berry fruits, orange zest and acidity that you could want. It's finely made with a creamy mousse and a fresh and fruity aftertaste."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Dürnberg,14.0,90.0,"Ripe, juicy pear scents make for an inviting nose. The wine's concentrated palate presents ample citrus with those pear notes, as well as spicy grapefruit zestiness. This is lovely, dry, refreshing and focused."
Red Blend,Austria,Burgenland,Gunter Triebaumer,14.0,90.0,"Apart from a ripe blueberry scent, the nose of this Zwiegelt and Cabernet Sauvignon blend is shy. The palate presents juicy, cinnamon-tinged blackberry and black cherry fruit, with a lovely whisper of white pepper around the edges. A very successful wine for a very ripe vintage, it has the firm tannins of Cabernet to lend appetizing balance to all the juicy fruit."
Riesling,US,New York,Lamoreaux Landing,14.0,90.0,"Whiffs of smoke and herbs add complexity to this beautifully floral, fruity wine. Off-dry in style, it's richly concentrated with peach and apricot flavors that reverberate on the palate with bracing lime-toned acidity. The long finish has a bristle of lemon-zest astringency."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Valmiñor,14.0,90.0,"Dry aromas of pithy citrus fruits come with a hint of fresh-cut grass. This feels steely and pure, with flavors of citrus fruits, nectarine and green apple. A racy finish offers tropical fruit flavors and a spot of bitterness."
Gewürztraminer,US,California,Husch,14.0,90.0,"Dry Gewürztraminer like this makes a great pairing with appetizers and seafood, and especially with white meats and grilled sausages. Here is a classic example, with rose petal aromas, piney-appley flavors, a rich texture and lingering, aromatic finish."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Foris,14.0,90.0,"Whether or not you are inclined toward the grape, this is a must-try bottle. Dry without being austere, it starts with a berry generosity featuring bright, almost hop-driven flavors. It smoothes out with notes of mineral and citrus, and a wonderfully refreshing finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lujon,14.0,90.0,"Vinified in stainless and left on the lees for six months, this wine sets its tasty, lime-inflected fruit against refreshing minerality. It's a bold, assertive style, with a lovely citrusy core."
Zinfandel,US,California,Boneshaker,14.0,90.0,"Flavorful but also gentle on the palate, despite the brand name, this is a lushly textured, full-bodied wine that lifts beautiful blueberry and blackberry flavors on fine-grained tannins. It has lightly spicy aromas, a mouthfilling viscosity and long finish."
Moscato,US,California,Uvaggio,14.0,90.0,"Made from Moscato Giallo grapes harvested late though still at low Brix, this is meant to serve as a dessert wine as it is slightly sweet, with 78 g/L of residual sugar. The aromas are pure and fully expressive of jasmine in bloom followed by apricot and honey. Light in alcohol, it shows a slight sweetness in the midpalate. Otherwise, it finishes dry, making it serviceable as an apéritif or midday-in-the-garden wine."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Artner,14.0,90.0,"The nose promises ripe, red cherry fruit and the palate delivers with a sprightly, bouncy, juicy red that's full of freshness. Wonderfully unpretentious fruit shines, with a little pepper spice to liven things up."
Sparkling Blend,US,Washington,Treveri Cellars,14.0,90.0,"A Chardonnay-based sparkler, this rich and concentrated wine has a luscious mix of apricot, peach and papaya fruit flavors in a creamy, textural setting. Exceptional length and development in the glass, which keeps bringing in nuances such as vanilla and pepper."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Foris,14.0,90.0,"Bright and packed with succulent apple and pear fruit, this retains ample juicy acidity for a perfectly balanced, fresh style. With its underlying wet stone minerality, it offers exceptional value."
White Blend,Spain,Galicia,Viña Costeira,14.0,90.0,"A treasure at this price. The nose is impeccably clean, with tropical fruit and honeyed melon aromas. Elegant in the mouth yet there's also just the right acidic pop to liven up the melon, kiwi and apple flavors. A pure, fruity ride. Treixadura, Torrontées, Loureira and Albariño comprise the blend."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Nine Stones,14.0,90.0,"Starts off slightly gamy and meaty, then adds bright blueberry fruit and hints of peppery spice. It's creamy-smooth in texture, medium-bodied and nicely balanced on the juicy, mouthwatering finish. A good value red to lay in for summer grilling."
Rosé,Austria,Niederösterreich,Schloss Gobelsburg,14.0,90.0,"Loads of fruit show on the nose of this wine: green and red apple, strawberry and ample, zesty citrus. The palate is taut, fresh, dry and precise, shot through with appetizing fruity flavors. A wonderful, flavorsome rosé, with or without food."
Chardonnay,Bulgaria,Danube River Plains,Chateau Burgozone,14.0,90.0,"This Chardonnay breaks away from the typical varietal profile, with aromas of freshly cut grass and lemongrass.

Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Don Miguel Gascón,14.0,90.0,"A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price."
Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Upland Estates,14.0,90.0,"This is a little gem, perfectly capturing the mix of flower, body powder, citrus and stone that only Gewürztraminer can evoke. Graceful and elegant, it spreads evenly across the palate and slides down the back of the throat. The residual sugar—1.8%—puts it squarely in the Alsatian camp."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Jurtschitsch,14.0,90.0,"A touch of peach colors the white and green fruit notes of this zippy white, its freshness amplified by a slight spritz. It's light bodied, dry and very refreshing, with a lovely herbal edge on the palate."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont,14.0,90.0,"This is a bold ripe wine that is dominated by firm while juicy Tannat. Named after the characteristic black berets worn by the menfolk of Gascony, the wine is powerful and dense with black fruits and balanced acidity. Drink this already enjoyable wine now, or better from 2018."
Riesling,US,Oregon,David Hill,14.0,90.0,"Made from vines planted in 1965, David Hill's estate Riesling is aromatic and textural, with an interesting, nuanced character that brings apples, peaches, pears and passion fruit flavors in profusion. Despite 1.8% residual sugar, it has plenty of acid and alcohol, finishing with a creamy, lemony fade."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Winzer Krems,14.0,90.0,"Savory notes of crushed chervil and yeast join lively, almost fizzing notes of lemon zest. This is ultrafresh, light-footed and very toned. Juicy, ripe acidity animates you to drink this almost as a thirst-quencher. This will work on a hot, sunny evening."
Zinfandel,US,California,Perry Creek,14.0,90.0,"It captures the Sierra Foothills balance of power and seems to have everything in the right proportions, including the price. Deep, nearly opaque garnet in color, it offers cedar and clove aromas that lead to rich fruit flavors like blackberry and boysenberry, firm tannins and full body."
Rosé,France,Provence,Château du Galoupet,14.0,90.0,"Galoupet's vineyards are close to the sea, giving the wine a delicious freshness. It is crisp with layers of fruits and acidity. Full in the mouth, this is a wine with a great place at the table."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Wines & Winemakers,14.0,90.0,"While still light, this Vinho Verde has a creamy texture and a sense of richness. It blends two of the quality grapes of the region, Alvarinho and Loureiro. Together they make an aromatic, intense and tangy wine that is ready to drink."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Spindrift Cellars,14.0,90.0,"This excellent Pinot Gris brings crisp, enticing flavors that perfectly mix pear skin, citrus and spice with a finish that somehow evokes coffee grounds and caramel. Huh? Don't know how that happens, but what a riot of flavor in such a simple wine. Better yet, the alcohol rests at an unbelievable 12.5%—unheard of in the last two decades. Tart and juicy, this is as European as it gets in Oregon."
Primitivo,US,California,Uvaggio,14.0,90.0,"Shyly aromatic at first, this beautiful Primitivo blended with 8% Barbera offers smooth layers of raspberry and just-ripe cherry, a seasoning of kitchen herbs and spice sprinkled in between. Not aged in barrels, it's all about the fruit and spice and the interplay in between, with no oak to interfere."
Syrah,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Laurent Miquel,14.0,90.0,"A gorgeous and decadent Syrah with aromas and flavors of black raspberry, black cherry, fudge brownie and coffee ice cream. The lush and creamy mouth is full but not overdone, with a fantastic evolution on the palate from fresh dark fruit to sweet chocolaty flavors and finally pepper-flecked spice on the long finish. Balanced and read to drink now, though you could hold for another couple of years to mellow."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Wines Gone Wild,14.0,90.0,"The appellation continues to impress with this variety, well showcased by this producer. White flowers and waxy apple form its character foremost, followed by lemon peel and zest. A dry, salty finish makes for a conclusively satisfying end."
Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Domaine Sangouard,14.0,90.0,"This rich and full-bodied Gamay from Vincent Sangouard is ripe with black cherry and sweet fruits. A juicy side brings acidity, while a dense, firm dry core promises some aging. Drink from 2016. The Leynes village is a sub-region producing Beaujolais Villages and Burgundy Maçon wines."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Hugl-Wimmer,14.0,90.0,"Ripe Concord pear and an intriguing, phenolic mouthfeel combine in this highly drinkable light white. There is enough weight to support food and a pleasing hint of savoriness as well as depth."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Austria,Biokult,14.0,90.0,"Creamy notes of pear still carry a hint of flinty smoke, but the pear notes rise with purity. The bright freshness of pure lemon lifts everything and makes for purity, ease, refreshment and blithe joy."
Fumé Blanc,US,California,Ferrari-Carano,14.0,90.0,"With searing, upfront acidity, this wine takes on a briny character that accents the high-toned lemon zest and melon notes on the palate. Aged only in old French oak and stainless steel, its fruit remains fresh and unencumbered through the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,14.0,90.0,"Made from old Douro vines, this wine is dark, almost black, with flavors as dense as its color. While rich, it is also fruity with blackberry flavor, sweet tannins and a cutting edge of acidity to give a lift at the end. Drink until 2020."
Riesling,US,Washington,Charles & Charles,14.0,90.0,"This wine charms with aromas of freshly sliced green apple, white peach, wet stone and flowers. It drinks off dry, with zippy acidity providing plenty of tension to keep the interest high."
Chardonnay,US,California,Bonterra,14.0,90.0,"Ripe fruit meets butter and spice in this medium-bodied, smooth and integrated wine. It opens with Bosc pear and golden apple aromas, melding with vanilla and marzipan notes, its richness of flavor nicely buoyed up by acidity."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,A to Z,14.0,90.0,"A superb value, this drinks way above its price. Buttery apple fruit is bedecked with cinnamon and buttressed with refreshing mineral-drenched acids. A nice hint of toast avoids any suggestion of clumsiness or artificiality."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Acrobat,14.0,90.0,"This wine knocks the flavors out of the park again this vintage, with spicy grapefruit and pine needle notes leading the charge. Think more cool fruit—lime flesh and skin—than tropical flavors. Add vivid acidity, impeccable balance and a refreshing, wet stone finish, and this is a must-have, everyday, goes-with-anything white."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Foris,14.0,90.0,"A directly appealing wine with notes of apple, toast and melon. It's fresh in feel, medium bodied with a good sense of balance throughout and a lingering finish."
Zweigelt,Austria,Niederösterreich,The Dot,14.0,90.0,"Although restrained on the nose, this wine leads with lovely, sprightly fresh flavors. Its tannins provide grip and are just a little drying, offsetting the red berry and cherry notes. It's balanced, fresh and moreish in its cherry-toned fruit. Try it with a slight chill."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,The Dot,14.0,90.0,"Pear and herb scents combine for a savory, fruity nose. The palate plays out its lovely, yeasty savoriness with hints of sage and fern. Citrus freshness animates and enlivens the lovely midpalate texture, leaving a clean and very refreshing finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Villa Maria,14.0,90.0,"A consistent standard-bearer for the variety as expressed in Marlborough, the 2016 Private Bin boasts ample red currant and pink grapefruit aromas and flavors, perked up by a touch of leafiness. It's medium-bodied and perhaps a bit rounder and softer in the mouth than some, but finishes dry and stony."
Red Blend,US,California,Prophecy,14.0,90.0,"This is a deeply colored, nicely oaky wine at a good price. It tastes like it's been aged to a peak already. The aromas are spicy, cedary and perfumed, while the flavors offer ripe berry and cherry notes and the texture is smooth but moderately tannic."
Tannat-Cabernet Franc,France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace,14.0,90.0,"This ripe, balanced wine is structured and packed with fruit. The firm tannins of Tannat are given a perfumed lift by Cabernet Franc, filling the palate with blackberry fruit and fine, balanced acidity.

Orange Muscat,US,California,Electra,14.0,90.0,"Beautiful rose petal, orange blossom and honey flavors practically leap out of the glass as this sweet, lightly sparkling and nicely concentrated wine works its charms. It has good acidity to balance all the sugary sweetness, and a low alcohol strength."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Heinz Eifel,14.0,90.0,"A fantastic bargain at $14, this nuanced wine balances heady saffron and spice notes against a backdrop of ripe mango and yellow cherry flavors.

Gamay,France,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,14.0,90.0,"A firmly terroir-driven wine, solidly based on its tannins and the richest of red fruits. Very mineral, chewy at this young stage, densely concentrated, the acidity a sharp light through the fruit. Powerful stuff."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine les Fouques,14.0,90.0,"A full, earthy, warm wine that has a strong herbal character as well as rich caramel and red fruits. It has a rare density for a rosé, textured and ripe. Try aging this wine for a  few months."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Bliss,14.0,90.0,"Dry, lively and fresh, this wine has an attractively restrained range of flavors that includes lemon, white pepper and herbs. It's thirst-quenching and clean in texture, with a fruit-driven acidity that reverberates on the finish."

Moscato,US,California,Quady,14.0,90.0,"Rich in grenadine and orange peel flavor, Red Electra is infused with the perfume of jasmine. Slightly effervescent, it would be delightful over ice or mixed into a gin and tonic and at under 6% alcohol is a nice apéritif to serve any guest."
Albariño,Spain,Galicia,Lagar de Indra,14.0,90.0,"Minerally lemon and stone-fruit aromas set up a leesy, layered palate with delicious flavors of lemon cake, tangerine and apple.

Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Karl Kaspar,13.0,90.0,"Tantalizing spice notes mix with aromas of quince and lanolin on this fabulous bargain Riesling.

Perfect as an aperitif, or paired with spicy, herbaceous Asian cuisine."
Chardonnay,US,California,Kirkland Signature,13.0,90.0,"Crisp in citrus, with noticeable tension that softens in the glass, this wine offers tremendous value and elegance. Medium bodied and well integrated in terms of oak and power, it has a lovely note of preserved lemon on the finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Leonard Kreusch,13.0,90.0,"Subdued smoke and earth tones on the nose contrast the concentrated tangerine and crunchy peach flavors in this bristling Kabinett. Lithe and lean, it boasts a piercing lime backbone that is exhilarating to the senses. Delicate honey tones soften a lingering finish."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Hidalgo,13.0,90.0,"Smooth and sweet, like a cream Sherry is supposed to be. On the nose, this one easily shifts from ripe apricot and peach fruit to nuts and saline. The palate starts with a blast of coffee and mocha and then folds in brown sugar and spice. Sweet, long and generous, with accents of cinnamon, clove and mild chocolate. Uncomplicated, which for $13 is a virtue."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,The Dot,13.0,90.0,"Very ripe, juicy pear notes emanate from the glass, but there is also a friendly tinge of yeast. The palate does both notions complete justice, delivering a refreshing but supple, peppery mouthful with a lovely, moreish and lip-smacking finish."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Benvenuto de la Serna,13.0,90.0,"Cassis and blackberry aromas are bold and show a feral side as this breathes.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Kopke,13.0,90.0,"A solid, tannic wine that has both great rich fruits and a dry core that needs to soften with age. It tastes powerful without sacrificing a perfumed and floral elegance. This is a serious wine, with a dense texture and potential. Drink from 2016."
Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,13.0,90.0,"Almost black in color, this is a concentrated powerhouse of black plum, damsons and dark berry fruits. It is explosively rich and densely structured, with intense juicy fruit."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,13.0,90.0,This is a southern and warmer take on Alvarinho than is found in northern Portugal. It brings out the ripe perfumed character of the grape. Apricot and golden plums show both the fruit and the generous texture. Drink this wine starting from late 2017.

The palate comes in with exquisite lightness, freshness and transparency, carrying refreshing aromatics on a vein of lemon zestiness. The finish adds green apple notes and leaves you wanting more. It's both delicate and aromatic."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Domaine Clair Moreau,13.0,90.0,The granite soil and ocean climate of Château-Thébaud—plus two years aging in tank—give this wine good richness while also retaining the crisper aspects of Muscadet. A delicate salty character lies over the final delicious apple and citrus flavors.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Casa de Cambres,13.0,90.0,"The Cambres vineyard sits on the hills just to the south of the Douro river, giving a rich, perfumed style of wood-aged wine.

Riesling,US,New York,Silver Thread,13.0,90.0,"Although the aromas are sweet, oozing with pear nectar, stone fruit, dried spices and apple blossoms, this wine features only 1.5% residual sugar. It's fairly big for a Finger Lakes Riesling, with a slightly oily texture, and comes across as being close to dry thanks to firm acids on the finish. The only problem with this wine is its limited availability."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Guilbaud Frères,13.0,90.0,"This is an attractive, fruity, concentrated wine. It has a salty, mineral character that adds a tang to the ripe apple and lime fruits. With its lift of acidity, it is crisp and refreshing at the end."

Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Monteiro,13.0,90.0,"This is a delicious wine, where the richness of Chardonnay dominates the fresher character of Arinto, resulting in a creamy, full-textured wine with touches of vanilla and ripe yellow fruits. It's well balanced, with the ripe acidity showing well at the end."

Crisp acids combine with soft tannins on the silky finish. Drink now–2022."
Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Cave du Marmandais,13.0,90.0,"The blend includes Bordeaux grapes along with the local Abouriou. Richly structured, it has the ripe black fruits to match. It shows power, although it also keeps an elegant balance between tannins and fruit. Hold until 2016."
Dolcetto,Italy,Piedmont,Pecchenino,13.0,90.0,"This lovely Dolcetto is delicious, fresh and utterly drinkable. It has a classic fragrance of strawberry, cherry and licorice, all of which carry over to the palate, along with earthy notes and a hint of almond.

Port,Portugal,Port,Quarles Harris,13.0,90.0,"A deliciously rich, sweet and youthfully fruity wine that has an opulent feel to it. There is a juicy element, with fresh acidity, but most of the character comes from the ripe fruit, the jelly character and the sweet tannins. It needs more bottle age."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Mothe du Barry,13.0,90.0,"The wine has been heavily extracted, giving an initial bitter coffee and a dry tannic character.

Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Mas des Bressades,13.0,90.0,"This Syrah-based cuvée is aged in barrel, but the cedary notes are only a backdrop to the floral, garrigue notes and dark fruit aromas.

Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Noble Vines,13.0,90.0,"There's nice restraint on the nose of this judiciously priced bottling by the Delicato group, with lemon-lime citrus and slightly green apple flesh on the nose. The wine is strongly textural once sipped, with sour apple, lime peel and riper stone fruit in the background, finishing grippy and clean."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Quinta de Porrais,13.0,90.0,"A touch of wood goes well with the ripe fruit. It is full in the mouth, rich and needing to age another few months. Yellow fruits and a ripe texture give an imposing presence. Drink from the end of 2014."

Riesling,US,Oregon,David Hill,12.0,90.0,"The winery notes that these are the oldest commercial Riesling vines in Oregon, planted in 1965. This has a succulent core of sweet apple-flavored fruit, quite rich and delicious. It dries out a little toward the back, but continues with excellent length and more of that crystal clear fresh red apple flavor. It's got enough textural interest to keep it from feeling one-dimensional."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Christopher,12.0,90.0,"Crushed mineral tones lend a smoky, dusty intensity to brilliantly ripe peach and mango flavors on this delicate off-dry Riesling. Bright with acidity and elegantly fruity, it's a fantastic bargain wine that should carry far beyond casual dining situations."
Red Blend,US,California,Bogle,12.0,90.0,"A sleek texture and delicious, focused fruit flavors like cranberry and black cherry make this full-bodied wine mouthfilling and compelling. It offers density and richness, too, which helps extend the lightly sweet finish."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Lujon,12.0,90.0,"Here's another super value from this under-the-radar producer. It's viscous and mouth filling, with lush pear and apple fruit. The concentration and fruit purity is exceptional."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Rapel Valley,Lapostolle,12.0,90.0,"Lapostolle's basic Cab scores big in the fine '01 vintage. It features a deep nose of tire rubber, blackberry and rusticity. The palate is high-octane and deep, with plenty of ripe, tannic black fruit. And the finish is round and lengthy. It should age well for a couple of years. Editors' Choice."
White Blend,Italy,Northeastern Italy,Masi,12.0,90.0,"This wine is the white partner to Masi's familiar Campfiorin. In this case, it is the 25% of Verduzzo grapes in the blend that have gone through the drying process known as passito. The 75% of Pinot Grigio adds spice, while the Verduzzo gives great richness and ripeness."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Sand Point,12.0,90.0,"This sophisticated and beautifully balanced wine shows that Lodi can make crisp and poised whites. It has aromas like white pepper and dried thyme, crisp lemon flavors and racy acidity. It is nicely dry, clean and tautly refreshing. While medium bodied, it has a big, vibrant presence."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Dancing Bull,12.0,90.0,"Tangy green-apple aromas and flavors make this medium-bodied wine refreshing, crisp and palate-cleansing. The texture is vibrant and the finish lively."
Red Blend,US,Washington,14 Hands,12.0,90.0,"Comprised of 62% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Syrah, this wine brings aromas of coffee, herbs and dark fruit. The fruit and barrel flavors are candy-bar sweet but still retain a sense of deftness."
Red Blend,Israel,Galilee,Recanati,12.0,90.0,"Aromas of black cherry, raspberry, flint, smoke and violet prep the palate for flavors of raspberry, black cherry, smoked meat, chocolate and black pepper. There is an interesting interplay of fruit flavors and savory notes of herb-rubbed meat. A web of soft tannins plays across the palate through a finish that has flavors of smoke and yellow cherry."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Adega Vila Real,12.0,90.0,"New wood and vanilla show strongly over the red-berry fruits. This wine has attractive tannins and acidity, balanced to give a fruity while structured character. Produced by the cooperative of Vila Real, the wine will be ready from late 2017."
Riesling,US,Washington,North by Northwest,12.0,90.0,"Quite tart and bone dry, this is made from fruit sourced from the Wallula Benches Vineyard—a site also prominently featured in Pacific Rim's Riesling lineup. Racy and gin-like in its flavor profile, it emphasizes botanical and citrus notes, with good penetration and length."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Morgenhof,12.0,90.0,"This French-run estate (the family is involved with Gosset Champagne and Cointreau liqueurs) has produced a stunning Chardonnay. Big on creamy fruit and nutty, buttery flavors, this wine pairs toast, acidity and ripe fruit in a fine, complex balance. Best Buy."
Chardonnay,South Africa,Robertson,De Wetshof,12.0,90.0,"A ripe but lively wine, from this master of Chardonnay. Danie de Wet's entry point wine is full, fat and toasty but also has fresh, green fruit flavors and a layer of cinammon and tropical fruits. It is great Chardonnay, delicious and tasty. Best Buy."
Moscato,Italy,Piedmont,Fontanafredda,12.0,90.0,"Heady aromas of fragrant white flower, citrus blossom, chopped herb and yellow stone fruit almost jump out of the glass. The creamy, expressive palate doles out juicy apricot, lemon drop and sage while bright acidity and a frothy mousse lift the finish. There's a lot to like here."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,12.0,90.0,"Smoky veins of struck flint and slate lend a savory mineral tone to this refreshingly tonic Riesling. Sweet-tart tangerine and grapefruit flavors are juxtaposed by bracing lime acidity, a racy mélange that lingers for a long but invigorating finish."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Markowitsch,12.0,90.0,"Fresh but ripe cherry notes shine on nose and palate of this wine. The body is fluid and has a pleasant weight: neither light nor heavy, with just enough density and freshness to fill the palate with its exuberant cherry fruit."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Urban,12.0,90.0,"Fresh, fragrant peaches are dusted with minerals on this deeply aromatic, intensely floral wine. Off dry in style and opulent in mouthfeel, it's balanced by a honed, steely minerality. It makes an impressive buy for a diminutive price."
Riesling,US,Washington,North by Northwest,12.0,90.0,"Done in a dry style, this fine effort is sourced from the Wallula Benches vineyard. It's good juice, with a delicious mix of stone fruits, citrus zest and a hint of sweet honey."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaine Sorin,12.0,90.0,"Rich, full tasting wine from the Sorin family, with smoothly ripe red berry fruits. There's an attractive orange zest character that gives piquancy to this great food rosé."
Sauvignon Blanc,India,Nashik,Sula,12.0,90.0,"Aromas of pink grapefruit, grass and coriander seed open the palate of this wine. Passion fruit, apricot, green apple and freshly chopped parsley mark the palate, with a touch of iodine on the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Caves Velhas,12.0,90.0,"This red wine is ripe and structured. It is has a finely textured mineral character that's typical of the Dão region. Rich berry and spicy fruits are dominant with attractive acidity. Behind this fruit, the tannins give a fine shape to a wine that is ready to drink now."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Septima,12.0,90.0,"Septima is owned by Codorníu of Spain, and it hit the market solidly in 2002, disappeared for a couple of years, and now is back with a great Best Buy. The 2006 Malbec is a rock star wine in sheep's clothing. Shows size and power along with pure fruit, texture and balance. Lush and fruity until the end."
Riesling,US,Washington,Milbrandt,12.0,90.0,"An off-dry, leesy, delicately floral Riesling, this elegantly captures the floral and mineral qualities that make the grape so exceptional. The wine doesn't push too hard, but it persists, mixing white peach and papaya with citrus blossom, rosewater and body powder. Exotic and delightful."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Casa Cadaval,12.0,90.0,"Licorice and dark chocolate flavors emerge with firm tannins cutting through the balanced fruit and acidity. Flavors are also of black cherry, damson and perhaps mineral. The wine needs decanting."
Rosé,Austria,Niederösterreich,Winzerkeller Andau,12.0,90.0,"Full-flavoured, almost heady notes of tart strawberry, crunchy red cherry and fresh lemon pervade nose and palate perfectly. This is a real mouthful of flavor, yet light and zippy. A very satisfying, grown-up rosé for countless summer days, lunches, picnics and parties. A real and delicious allrounder."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Loosen,12.0,90.0,"Juicy streaks of grapefruit and pineapple in this spry, dry Riesling are cut by laser-focused acidity and rocky edges of slate. It's approachable and fresh yet abundantly elegant. Drink now through 2018."
Torrontés,Argentina,Other,Don Manuel Villafañe,12.0,90.0,"A really good and clean white wine with all the tropicality and zest that this Argentine variety can give. The nose is crystalline and pure, with white flower scents of jasmine and citrus blossom, while the palate is round, melony and full of lychee and papaya. Smooth on the finish. Drink soon."
Sangiovese,US,Washington,Barnard Griffin,12.0,90.0,"A perennial best-of-show winner, this lush take on rosé bursts with pretty cherry fruit, light touches of brioche and fresh-baked rolls. It finishes with a kiss of spice."
Merlot,US,Washington,Hyatt,12.0,90.0,"Smooth and instantly appealing, this estate-grown Merlot has a broad, chocolaty palate that's loaded with cherry fruit. There are peppery, herbal highlights, and plenty of lingering, polished tannins."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Borges,12.0,90.0,"The low-yield old vines of the quinta have produced a dense wine with firm tannins. Young and with good potential, the wine is a blend of four Douro grapes, dominated by Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz. Unoaked, it is rich and firm, all ripe blackberry fruits with a cut of acidity. Drink from 2018."
Chardonnay,US,California,Gen5,12.0,90.0,"The fifth generation certainly got it right. This wine is more savory than fruity, as earth and oak flavors highlight the aromas while baking spices and almond flavors soothe the palate. It's smooth and lush in texture and not too heavy in body. Drink now."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Ironstone,12.0,90.0,"Intense and concentrated blackberry flavors rise above thick tannins in this full-bodied wine. Aromas suggest boysenberry, smoke and clove, while the flavors taste more like blackberry jam. Although the texture is dense and tannic, it stays velvety rather than drying. This will be great now with ribs or roast venison, but will easily age through 2020."
Rosé,US,Oregon,High Pass,12.0,90.0,"Cherry red, aromatic with scents of crushed roses, strawberries and cherries, this brings a gentle touch of sweetness to the lush fruit flavors. It's pretty as can be, bursting with strawberry fruit, and a very good value. Drink chilled with mild cheeses."
Zweigelt,Austria,Carnuntum,Nadler,12.0,90.0,"Alongside the fresh red cherry fruit there are hints of iron oxide and pepper. None dominate, but they present themselves in beautiful waves making for a very intriguing palate with soft, pliable tannins and a fresh backbone. A very authentic rendition of Zweigelt. So fresh and so moreish."
Viognier,Australia,South Australia,Yalumba,12.0,90.0,"A terrific deal, this is as varietally correct and rich a Viognier as you'll find for the price. Honeysuckle and apricot notes are carried by a slightly oily texture, yet the wine finishes long and elegantly. Vegan. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Bélingard,12.0,90.0,"Dominated by Merlot, this is a fruity wine with finely integrated tannins. It has the red fruits and acidity of the vintage given weight by 13 months of wood aging and the concentration of old vines. Drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Southwest France,Château Bélingard,12.0,90.0,"This wood-aged blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon has ripe fruits and plenty of the crisp acidity typical of the vintage. Its wood touches are subtle, just enough to give a creamy texture. The wine has a rich texture and will certainly age for another few months. Drink from 2018."
White Blend,Greece,Peloponnese,Skouras,12.0,90.0,"This blend of Roditis and Moscofilero offers floral, flirty aromas and a palate that's both fresh and layered. Flavors of lemon, violet and orange are rounded but balanced by lively acidity."
Monastrell,Spain,Levante,Enrique Mendoza,12.0,90.0,"A mixed bag of appealing aromas include crushed stone, leather, black cherry and cough drop. The palate on this Monastrell is narrow and pinchy, but packs power. Flavors of toasty oak, mint, black plum and cherry charge across the finish due to popping acidity. Drink through 2019."
Zinfandel,US,California,Tortoise Creek,12.0,90.0,"Nicely dry and well structured, this full-bodied wine will provide serious enjoyment at the dinner table. It has all the ripe, juicy berry qualities of the grape variety and adds moderate tannins for a firmer mouthfeel. Layers of blackberry, cherry and pepper flavors make it especially interesting."
Shiraz,Australia,South Australia,Paringa,12.0,90.0,"This is the sort of stereotypical Aussie Shiraz the haters love to hate. It's full-bodied, warm and plush, oozing with blackberries and plums and loaded up with vanilla and mocha. Yet it's well done, inexpensive and just plain delicious. Drink now–2020."
Red Blend,US,California,Gnarly Head,12.0,90.0,"This wine is  dark in color, with just a thin red rim. It smells of ripe blackberries, grilled beef and clove, with flavors as dense as the color. For all its color and flavor intensity and fine-grained tannins, however, it feels smooth and velvety on the tongue and is hard to resist, especially at such a reasonable price."
Zinfandel,US,California,Boeger,12.0,90.0,"Delicious and bold, this dry wine is easy to enjoy and appreciate. It has aromas like crushed fresh raspberries and blackberries, flavors that are ripe and rich without overdoing it, and a smooth texture punctuated with some fine-grained tannins."
Riesling,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,12.0,90.0,"This exceptional effort is packed with sweet and tart fruits, beginning with lemon-lime, then moving through peaches and apricots and on into hints of papaya. Good length and splendid acidity."
Riesling,US,New York,Red Newt Cellars,12.0,90.0,"Exotic melon and pineapple flavors are accented by hints of chalk and powdered sugar on this brisk yet penetrating Riesling. Light on its feet with a textural, almost feathery, mouthfeel, it's an incredible steal at $12."
Chardonnay,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Bulgariana,12.0,90.0,"Straw colored in the glass, this Bulgarian Chardonnay has aromas of custard apple, mango and lemon flowers. In the mouth, it has flavors of green apple, white peach and tropical fruit flavors, especially guava and mango. It is well rounded in the mouth with a soft finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wachau,Johann Donabaum,12.0,90.0,"The nose gives away very little. The palate has exquisite lightness, with a fine spray of tender spritz that accentuates the slight white-pepper notes. Lemon and green pear shimmer through. This is light but refreshing, with a clean, spicy lemon finish."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Mirassou,12.0,90.0,"Red wine doesn't get much smoother—and values in Pinot Noir don't get much better—than this. The wine has attractive red- and black-cherry aromas, a sense of richness on the palate and a silky mouthfeel that's hard to resist. Subtlety and restraint keep this wine from tiring the taste buds."
Blaufränkisch,Austria,Burgenland,Uwe Schiefer,12.0,90.0,"All the characteristics of Blaufränkisch emerge: dark berry fruit, white pepper, freshness and a structured but svelte figure. This is eminently drinkable with its wonderful backbone of acidity, its uncomplicated blueberry fruit and very appealing rusticity that makes you want to sip."
Riesling,US,Oregon,Château Bianca,12.0,90.0,"Wonderfully fragrant and pretty, this delicately-made Riesling mixes candied pineapple, honeyed lemon, and pekoe tea flavors to good effect. It's a perfect late spring porch pounder."
Rosé,Germany,Pfalz,Villa Wolf,12.0,90.0,"Intense mineral tones of smoke and crushed slate collide with fresh red cherry and raspberry flavors on the palate of this bang-for-your-buck rosé. Its concentrated fruit flavors are luscious and satisfying but also vibrantly structured, proving dexterous beyond the apéritif hour."
Merlot,US,Washington,Charles Smith,12.0,90.0,"The aromas of herbs, pencil lead and blue and red fruit are forward, fresh and appealing. The flavors follow similarly, showing depth and balance uncommon for a wine this price."
Merlot,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,12.0,90.0,"Generous and aromatic,  this flavorful Merlot is a showcase for ripe black cherry fruit, accented with strong streaks of vanilla and tobacco. The plush, dark fruit leads into a tasty, toasty finish, with notes of licorice and smoke."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Line 39,11.0,90.0,"Aromatic and elegant, generous and supple, this tastes rich while feeling polished and complete. An enticing, light aroma of oaky spice and raspberry mixes with tasty red cherry and black currant flavors on the palate. It is medium bodied, smooth in texture, and has a mild finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,11.0,90.0,"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Bulgariana,11.0,90.0,"Dark garnet to the eye, this wine has aromas of black cherry, black raspberry, coffee and freshly ground black pepper. Flavors of height-of-summer cherry, raspberry and baking spice persist on the palate through a finish that is awash in silky tannins."
Champagne Blend,Italy,Veneto,Canella,11.0,90.0,"Very smooth in the nose, with fragrant, fresh aromas of flowers, lemon and lime. The dry citrusy palate and soft mouthfeel work perfectly together, while the finish is long, fruity and very pleasant. Quite a tasty sparkler with pure fruit. Its quality is obvious."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Noble Vines,11.0,90.0,"This vintage shows cut grass, ripe apple, pear, wet cement and nectarine sorbet aromas in a wine that's almost as clear as water. The palate is textural and full of zip, with rainy day-like crispness and green fruit flavors."
Riesling,US,Washington,Hogue,11.0,90.0,"Off-dry, with 24 g/L residual sugar, this fragrant and refreshing wine blends in small amounts of Muscat and Gewürztraminer. Tangerine and peach flavors are concentrated in the core, while the finish brings in lovely flavors of English breakfast tea."
Pinot Noir,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,K Cellars,11.0,90.0,"Rich aromas of boysenberry, cranberry, pipe tobacco and dark chocolate prepare the palate for flavors of cherry syrup and pomegranate. Soft but persistent tannins are apparent in the mouth, and the finish offers lingering flavors of dark chocolate and coffee."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,K Cellars,11.0,90.0,"Aromas of blackberry, ripe cherry, black pepper and espresso bean delight the nose. Deep ruby red, this wine has flavors of black cherry, blackberry, cinnamon and nutmeg that are supported by a soft grid of velvety tannins."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,11.0,90.0,"Pretty blossom and apricot aromas bolster ripe, rich flavors of honey tangerine and yellow peach in this forward, fruity wine. There's no pretense here: It's a hedonistic guzzler of a wine, but its tangy salt-and-lime finish makes it hard to resist another glass. Drink while young."
Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon,Portugal,Bairrada,Aveleda,11.0,90.0,"This wine is firmly tannic, while promising fine fruitiness as it develops. The acidity and black fruits are about to break through the imposing tannic edifice. This wine will be best from 2017."
Malbec,France,Southwest France,Château Saint-Sernin,11.0,90.0,"With its new wood and mint flavors, this is a smooth, polished wine, full of delicious ripe black fruit flavors and acidity. The wine is elegant, the wood already well integrated into the fruit. Age for 3–4 years."
Riesling,US,Washington,Hogue,11.0,90.0,"Lightly off dry, this graceful and beautifully balanced wine blends in about 7% Gewürztraminer, elevating the aromatics. Key lime, pink grapefruit and a touch of lemon zest are in play, with a finish that recalls a sip of English breakfast tea."
Riesling,US,Idaho,Sawtooth,11.0,90.0,"Spicy and substantial, this authoritative Riesling snaps into tight focus around apple and melon flavors. Hints of clove and ginger add complexity."
Alvarinho,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,11.0,90.0,"A rounded wine with spiced pear and citrus fruits, this is juicy and full bodied. A touch of textured minerality gives a sense of structure. It's still young and needs aging. Drink from 2015."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trivento,11.0,90.0,"A lusty value made right. The nose issues black cherry, cough drop and cassis aromas. It's concentrated and balanced, while flavors of black cherry and cassis follow the nose. A mild tannic burn and chocolate on the finish tell you it's good and can go with any meat, from burgers to a quality steak or roast."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Chakana,11.0,90.0,"Chakana strikes again with this excellent value-priced Malbec. The nose hits firmly with smoke and rubber before settling on ripe black fruit notes. Then the palate holds form, with blackberry making its mark before chocolate fills the void. Great depth and purity for a wine not meant to be complicated."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Magnum Vinhos,11.0,90.0,"This solid, dense blend of Touriga Nacional, Trincadeira and Aragonez has good structure with juicy berry fruits alongside sweet tannins. It's rich, the firm texture giving the wine weight and concentration. The aftertaste brings forward more juicy fruitiness. Drink from 2015."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Line 39,11.0,90.0,"A tasty vein of cranberry and raspberry runs from the nose to the palate, and lingers on the finish, giving this value-priced wine focus and vibrance. It has plenty of fresh acidity, fine tannins and good depth of flavor."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Urbans-Hof,11.0,90.0,This richly concentrated Riesling calibrates juicy sweet peach and honey flavors with an invigorating crush of lemon-lime acidity. It's an irresistibly fruity yet refreshing wine at an exceptional value price.
Pedro Ximénez,Spain,Andalucia,Alvear,11.0,90.0,"Fino Sherry rarely has this kind of weight and complexity. It's full of spunk, grab and length, and that's probably due to the fact that it's made from Pedro Ximenez grapes and not the more common Palomino. Likely marvelous with garlic shrimp or langostinos."
Sparkling Blend,France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre,11.0,90.0,"This is a crisp, refreshing wine. With a mousse that is lively but with a creamy edge, it offers attractive apple fruitiness. A hint of toast suggests some good bottle age. The wine finishes with a mineral, tangy aftertaste."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alenquer,Casa Santos Lima,11.0,90.0,"From a small sub-region of Lisboa, this stylish, structured wine is firm and tannic. It has plenty of ripe berry fruit to balance the tannins as well as acidity that cuts through the richness of the wine. It is ready to drink."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Domaine Boyar,11.0,90.0,"This garnet-colored Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas of black cherry and wet river rock. In the mouth, there are flavors of black plum, black cherry and a touch of graphite before the smooth tannic finish."
Merlot,US,California,Cookies & Cream,10.0,90.0,"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Aveleda,10.0,90.0,"A blend of the two major grapes of the region, Alvarinho and Loureiro, and grown at the home estate of the producer, this is delicious Vinho Verde. It is dry, crisp, light and piercingly bright, perfect either as an apéritif or with seafood. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Vircoulon,10.0,90.0,"This is a ripe and soft blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. Well balanced, it has rich, spicy fruit lifted by lemon and apple flavors and by the final acidity. It's ready to drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Wines & Winemakers,10.0,90.0,"Classic tannic Dão Touriga Nacional, packed with minerality, dark and dry tannins, firm and with a good juicy final character. Part of a range of wines from across the country under the name Azul Portugal."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Bergevin Lane,10.0,90.0,"This lovely blend of Sauvignon Blanc, and 14% Roussanne, is as crisp and fresh as its name implies. Bright fruit flavors of lemon, lime, orange and pineapple speak to the success of this unusual blend. It's a bracing, palate-cleansing white wine that will be appealing all year round."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,10.0,90.0,"This dark, structured wine, with its balanced blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz, is firm with tannins and dense berry fruits. Full in the mouth, it is a concentrated wine that brings out a strongly chalky texture. The wine is still moving towards a rich future. Drink from 2017."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Caves Velhas,10.0,90.0,"Mint and red-fruit aromas dominate this classic Dão wine, with its firm tannins and mineral structure. Spice, toast and dark-berry flavors give a feeling of weight to a wine that demands to be paired with rich red meats."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Bruno Cormerais,10.0,90.0,"Rich, this offers both bright crisp citrus fruits and ripe peach and pear flavors. It is still young, still textured and tight, needing to broaden to bring out more of the attractive fruitiness. Drink from 2016."
Merlot,US,California,Gnarly Head,10.0,90.0,"This wine has all the necessary smoothness, plus deep plum and cherry flavors and touches of spicy oak, too. The texture feels layered and the fruit components are vivid and tasty. It all comes together gracefully on the palate and the finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Enoport,10.0,90.0,"From vineyards on the north bank of the Douro, this is a rounded, smooth wine that has layers of black fruits and finely integrated tannins. It is bold, ripe, full of blackberry fruitiness and a perfume from the Touriga Nacional in the blend. It is drinkable now, but will be better from the end of 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Camelot la Chapelle,10.0,90.0,"This is a wine with potential. It has weight and ripe berry fruits balanced with solid tannins and a dense texture. Behind the structure, the fruit and acidity promise good things. Drink from 2016."
Merlot,US,California,Dark Horse,10.0,90.0,"Complexity and varietal character come through in this concentrated, well-balanced and smoothly polished wine. It is full bodied and lightly tannic, but so oozing with flavors that it's still easy to sip. The array of black plum, light sage, and black olive flavors is accented with very light oak."
Chenin Blanc,India,Nashik,Sula,10.0,90.0,"Pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot show brightly on the nose and palate. Simultaneously refreshing and sophisticated on the palate, this wine has a crisp, lingering finish laced with flavors of almond blossom."
Zinfandel,US,California,Kirkland Signature,10.0,90.0,"This is a screaming deal for such an admirably good wine, blended with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah and Syrah. Compressed black fruit meets fresh leather on the perfumed nose. The palate follows with thick tannins and mouthcoating flavors of licorice and cinnamon."
Riesling,Austria,Wachau,Johann Donabaum,10.0,90.0,"The spark of freshly cut lime and lemon is met by riper notions of yellow Mirabelle and Reine Claude plums. There is delicacy and slenderness but above all a bracing clean, sprightly character. Utterly refreshing."
Bonarda,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Dolce Stefania,10.0,90.0,"Chocolaty and malty to start with, then more meaty, rubbery and traditional on the nose. The palate is round and just right in feel, while the palate is meaty, layered and savory, with juicy acidity and savory undercurrents. Cutting and food-friendly, and very well-made for a $10 wine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz,10.0,90.0,"The cooperative of Reguengos is now a major force in the region. This wine, named after the hilltop town of Reguengos, is a powerful, condensed wine. It has dark black fruits, solid tannins and a smooth texture. Full-bodied and worth aging. Drink from 2015."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Roche Bazin,10.0,90.0,"A rich, bold wine full of wood flavors that are already well integrated with the ripe fruit and solid tannins. The wine is dense, while having a surface polish of smooth fruitiness. Give the wine 3–5 years."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,10.0,90.0,"Round and smooth, this has a weighty, full-bodied structure, with the Alvarinho adding a more crisp character. Pear and melon fruits are balanced by citrusy acidity."
Sherry,Spain,Andalucia,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,10.0,90.0,"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan."
Riesling,US,Washington,For a Song,10.0,90.0,"Though not labeled as such, this thrilling Riesling comes from the Ancient Lakes appellation and brings aromatic notes of peach, orange blossom and pear. It drinks medium-sweet with abundant stone fruit flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Gnarly Head,10.0,90.0,"This great buy shows a sophisticated blend of spice and fruit aromas. Medium-bodied and classically dry, it has good balance, moderate fruit flavors and light toast and ginger notes that add complexity."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,10.0,90.0,"Clean and fresh, this juicy wine carries a bit of fruit sweetness, but the flavors are tilted toward minerality rather than fruitiness. It's wonderfully refreshing, with a mix of citrus rind, melon and white peach working into an extended, palate-cleansing finish."
Riesling,Austria,Kremstal,Unger,10.0,90.0,"This opens with a breezy fragrance of citrus zest and mandarin leaf, hinting at deeper, riper peach within. The palate is soft but defined; while slender, it still abounds with citrus-framed peach."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Pinhal da Torre,10.0,90.0,"White peach aromas give a warm feeling. It has fine acidity as well, bursting with fruit and with just a touch of toast. It's ready to drink but will benefit by holding until 2015 in bottle."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,10.0,90.0,"This is an excellent Harvest Select bottling, with bright, sappy flavors that seem not all that sweet. The residual sugar, listed at 47 g/L, is an asset, but doesn't dominate. Flavors remain as crisp as a fresh Macintosh apple, juicy, forward and delicious."
Riesling,US,Washington,Washington Hills,10.0,90.0,"With 7% residual sugar and 11% alcohol, this is a Riesling to enjoy with spicy noodle dishes. Sweetness notwithstanding, it's a substantial wine with grip and definition. Melon and peach flavors roll smoothly into notes of caramel and honey. This is rich and delicious."
Riesling,US,Washington,Washington Hills,10.0,90.0,"Light and lovely, this has just under 2% residual sugar, but it tastes drier than that. Arresting scents of jasmine tea and honeysuckle give it an enticing floral character. It glides into a soft palate dappled with accents of flowers, oils and incense. Includes small amounts of Chardonnay and Gewürztraminer."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Dão,Pedra Cancela,10.0,90.0,"A blend of Malvasia Fina and the great local grape Encruzado, this rich, wood-aged wine is perfumed and offers great fruitiness. Citrus and green plum fruits mingle with pineapple. The texture and the light toast give weight and add another dimension. The wine can be drunk now, but will be better from 2015."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Casa Santos Lima,10.0,90.0,"This structured and dense wine hails from the steep, sloping hills of the Lisboa region. While aged in Portuguese oak, which provides spice and dark tannins, the delicious black fruit core is not overpowered. Drink now–2016."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Caves Aliança,10.0,90.0,"A year in the barrel has given this powerful wine structured, yet polished tannins. While still young, it is powered by ripe red berry notes and driving juicy acidity. It's a wine for further aging, so drink from 2016."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Viña Cumbrero,10.0,90.0,"Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas are light, pure and fully inviting, with nothing off-putting. This tastes bright and balanced, with cherry and berry flavors that are impossible not to like. A dash of oaky cocoa blends with leftover red fruit flavors on a nice finish."
Riesling,US,Idaho,Colter's Creek,10.0,90.0,"A little reticent on the nose, but opens up generously in the mouth. It's off-dry (3% residual sugar), with a flavorful, round mix of citrus, tangerine and nectarine fruits. Full-bodied and lingering, it sails into a clean, tangy finish."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Arthur Metz,19.0,89.5,"A totally fresh nose of lemon, wet stone and greengage creates an enticing opening. These flavors also present themselves on the light palate, where they are dispersed by a fine, creamy mousse. The impression is one of light-bodied but fruity cleanness. This refreshing, brisk and enlivening sparkler is ready now, but will continue to develop through 2022. Bread and lemon, rather than primary fruit, denotes the scent. The dry and restrained palate is serious and values yeasty autolytic notes above fruit. There is lemon freshness among the yeast and bread flavors and a dry, almost severe finish."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Lucien Albrecht,17.0,89.5,"Tart red currant, rhubarb and strawberry come together in a very refreshing, rounded and appetizing fashion. The frothy, foaming mousse is exuberant and highlights these strawberry shortcake flavors brilliantly, while a totally dry palate makes sure that this stays classy. This is very satisfying, fun and fruit-driven, with a serious core and a bright, lemony finish. The red-fruit flavors on the nose almost have a candied edge, akin to red-berry candy. The palate adds lots of freshness and a finely fizzing mousse on its light fruit-driven body. The finish is refreshing, dry and echoes with fruit."
Sparkling Blend,France,Alsace,Lucien Albrecht,17.0,89.5,"Lifted notes of ripe, juicy apple are foremost on the nose. They also shine on the palate, where they are countered by a fine, gentle and creamy mousse and lovely freshness. This is beautifully composed, understated, fresh and elegant. The dry finish shines with lemon and echoes long. Creamy, almost powdery pear flavors dominate, but the palate is illuminated by bright, sprightly lemon acidity. There is an innate balance that can be summed up as creamy lemon on a dry, yeasty background. This is moreish, appetizing and has a lasting, fruity finish."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade das Servas,17.0,89.5,"This is powerful stuff, packed tightly with tannins, juicy black fruits and a solid, concentrated structure. The wine is ripe and spicy, with a touch of pepper from the alcohol. It is also dense, still firm and needs further time to develop. Drink from 2016. The wine is undeniably rich, but it wears its richness easily, allowing the fruitiness to show through. With hints of wood aging, spice as well as peach and ripe apricot fruits, it is full of potential. Drink from 2015."
Muscadelle,Australia,Victoria,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,16.0,89.5,"This is a terrific introduction to the Rutherglen style, sweet, fortified, but with decent balancing acids. It offers bold aromas of bergamot, honey and fig, flavors of caramelized pineapple and flamed orange zest and a moderately long finish. Full-bodied and sweet, this amber-hued fortified is one of the entry points into the Chambers universe. Dried figs and soy sauce mark the nose, while the flavors combine hints of mushrooms, roasted meat and maple syrup. The finish is long, with just a hint of scorched sugar."
Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,France,Loire Valley,Bouvet-Ladubay,15.5,89.5,"With a high proportion of Chardonnay, this is a ripe, full-bodied and lightly toasty wine. It's rich in the mouth and rounded with the crisp green acidity playing a good supporting role. This bottle shows some maturity, giving a complex aftertaste. A ripe wine that shows strong flavors of Chenin Blanc in the blend. That gives a nutty character to the wine while there is also a delicious lively freshness. The wine is bursting with energy, fresh and fruity finishing with tight acidity."
White Blend,US,America,Sokol Blosser,15.0,89.5,"This nonvintage blend is best identified by its edtion number—this latest being #20. It's a runaway success, cleverly incorporating up to eight different varieties. Mixing aromatic whites and fruit-powered grapes such as Chardonnay and Pinot Gris, it captures the best of both. Here the citrusy aromatics are principally from Muscat, while a touch of Sémillon adds a lick of lanolin to the tangy, juicy fruit. The 19th edition (the edition numbers serve a similar function to a vintage date) of this popular blend uses eight varieties, mostly aromatic, with no oak influence. The result is just a touch off dry (10 g/L residual sugar), low alcohol, and loaded with scents and flavors of flowers and fruits. A whiff of body powder moves into a midpalate nicely focused on peach and citrus flavors."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Carlos Basso,10.0,89.0,"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Nastl,10.0,89.0,"Only very slight citrus notes appear on the nose. The palate opens into soft fruitiness with slight hints of apricot and peach. The chief attraction, though, is a central, vivid theme of white pepper. This is light bodied but full of subtle charms."
Riesling,US,Washington,Pacific Rim,10.0,89.0,"Sweet but not too sweet for some entrées, such as spicy Thai food, this brings a fruity mix of pear, pineapple and orange-creamsickle flavors. It's smooth and soft, not at all sugary, and framed with fresh acids."
Zinfandel,US,California,Montevina,10.0,89.0,"Meaty, spicy accents enliven this full-bodied and ripe-tasting wine, adding a layer of interest and depth. The aromas and flavors show blackberries and black pepper, while the texture is smooth and a sense of richness on the lingering the finish."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Caves de Rauzan,10.0,89.0,"This wine has good spiciness, ripe fruits and firm tannins. There is a good balance between acidity from red berry fruits and a dense, tannic character. It is solid and concentrated, and needing to age longer. Drink from 2015."
Bonarda,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Alma del Sur,10.0,89.0,"Clean and full for starters, with big berry aromas and hints of freshly poured tar as well as minerality. The palate is pure and hits the nail on the head in terms of feel. Flavors of blackberry and plum are dark and generous. Finishes with pepper, espresso and chocolate. Very good wine for the price."
Rosé,France,Bordeaux,Château Fonfroide,10.0,89.0,This is a fresh but also full and rich wine with ripe pear and raspberry fruits. The wine is balanced and ready to drink.
Barbera,US,California,Montevina,10.0,89.0,"This tempting wine from one of Amador's biggest and oldest wineries has a great price and lots of big flavors. It smells like wild berries and light baking spices, tastes almost jammy, and has a classy dry balance. A very smooth texture wraps up all that goodness and makes it easy to enjoy."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Karl Josef,10.0,89.0,"While effortlessly quaffable, this pretty, intensely floral off-dry Riesling also has a polished mineral tone throughout. Plush honeydew and yellow cherry notes are delicately sweet, offset by a revitalizing lime finish."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,La Cappuccina,10.0,89.0,"It opens with a floral fragrance of Spanish broom, jasmine and chamomile. The juicy palate delivers citrus, pineapple and almond alongside crisp acidity that lends a clean, refreshing close."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Bairrada,Dão Sul,10.0,89.0,"Baga has been softened by Merlot to produce a rounded wine, with accents of spice and generous tannins. Berry fruits come strongly through the dry core, giving a rich character to the wine. The finish is full of acidity and ripe red fruits."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Roche Bazin,10.0,89.0,"This finely structured wine is ripe and full of blackberry flavors, with a soft, rich texture. That suggests it will age relatively quickly and be ready to drink from 2019."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Peynaud-Bagnac,10.0,89.0,"This is a smooth, wood-aged wine. Ripe black fruits are soft, with a contrast of toast and spice. It's juicy, with just the right amount of tannin. Although it's almost ready to drink, the wine will also age because of its structure. Drink from 2016."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Castle Rock,10.0,89.0,"Vivid grapefruit and crisp apple notes give a big personality to this medium-bodied wine. A light sweetness takes off the acidic edge, while oaky and earthy accents linger on the finish. It's a terrific value and not hard to find."
Merlot,US,California,Bogle,10.0,89.0,"Nicely behaved and well balanced, this gentle wine offers medium body, fresh plum flavors and a texture that's smooth and lightly tannic. The color is relatively deep and aromas are fruity, with a touch of earth."
Bonarda,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Altos Las Hormigas,10.0,89.0,"Intense and extracted but also well balanced and smooth, with minerality and asphalt on the nose. The palate mixes deep black fruit weight and flavors with snappy acids, and overall this is bright, bullish and full of berry and black cherry along with chocolate. A ripe, satisfying wine for the money."
Agiorgitiko,Greece,Peloponnese,Katogi & Strofilia,10.0,89.0,"Violet, blackberry and plums on the nose are followed by unctuous, dark berry flavors in his affordable red. The wine has body but is buoyed by good structure and acidity. A very god alternative to everyday reds, and with a more mysterious overall character."
Mencía,Spain,Northern Spain,Vega Montán,10.0,89.0,"Slightly rubbery black cherry and blackberry aromas are generic but good. This feels round and easygoing, with soft tannins and modest acidity. Black-plum flavors fly solo, while this is nice but hollow on the finish. Drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Wines & Winemakers,10.0,89.0,"Ripe and smooth wine, with a rich Port-like aroma, the sweet fruit structured with some fresh stalky tannins. Great herbal and wild berry flavors to finish."
Red Blend,Spain,Levante,Altos del Cuco,10.0,89.0,"A smooth wine for the price where all the dots connect. The nose has black cherry and raisin, while the palate is lush, deep and concentrated, with rewarding flavors of cherry, cassis and roasted plum. Lasting on the finish, with a licorice flavor. Very good wine for the money; Monastrell/Syrah/Tempranillo is the blend."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Provam,10.0,89.0,"This is the entry-level wine from this Alvarinho specialist. A blend with Trajadura, it is crisp, light and bright. Tangy orange and lemon zest flavors give the wine its tight, lively acidity and refreshing aftertaste. Drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Blue Fish,10.0,89.0,"Balanced sweetness and pure fruity freshness personify this surprisingly elegant bargain buy. The palate bursts of fresh pear, grapefruit and tangerine flavors accented by a glaze of waxy lemon peels. Bristling acidity leads a long, revitalizing finish."
Grillo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Stemmari,10.0,89.0,"Alluring aromas of citrus, white flower and a whiff of tropical fruit come together on this. The racy palate offers lemon zest, mango, sage, saline and an almond note alongside vibrant acidity."
Riesling,US,Washington,Pacific Rim,10.0,89.0,"Penetrating aromas suggest lemon oil and citrus blossom, with a hint of terpene. This is the driest version of this wine to date, with residual sugar down around 0.5%. Pear skin, pear flesh and citrus carry it through a lengthy finish."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Dürnberg,10.0,89.0,"Lemon, green pear and aloe vera meld into a balanced, streamlined white with focus, elegance and depth. Citrus flavors play with peppery spice and combine for a lasting finish."
Merlot,US,California,Bogle,10.0,89.0,"Complex fruit, herb and subtle oak aromas lead to an appetizingly dry feel and mellow, woodsy, autumnal flavors. It's medium bodied, smooth-textured and just savory enough to complement the tasty fruit flavors."
Chardonnay,US,California,Gnarly Head,10.0,89.0,"This offers that tempting aroma of toasted baguette with a dab of butter, then the flavors flow fresh and peachy, while the texture feels smooth and the body not too full. Well balanced between flavors, acidity and body, it brings refreshment to sip after another."
Rosé,France,France Other,Marrenon,10.0,89.0,"This light-bodied Merlot rosé is a summer delight. Hints of strawberry blossom and citrus mark the nose, while the palate features berry shadings set against a backdrop of citrus, something like a dry, adult version of pink lemonade."
Chardonnay,Chile,Maipo Valley,De Martino,10.0,89.0,"Creamy and lush, with pure peach and pear aromas along with nice vanilla accents. The palate is fairly rich and layered, but it's also properly acidic and, therefore, well balanced. The flavors of pear and butter seem on the money, and the finish is solid and of moderate length. All in all, this is a very good Chardonnay with no overt faults."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Montes,10.0,89.0,"This could very well be Chile's most expressive, interesting white Sauvignon. It's got all those prickly pineapple, passion fruit, scallion and pepper notes that are typical, and also a lot of pure citrus flavors backing it all up. The mouthfeel is zesty and spirited, but there's natural roundness, too. Some licorice adds complexity to the finish. Best Buy."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Wagram,Eschenhof Holzer,10.0,89.0,"Very subtle but the alluring flesh of melon and peeled pear is hinted at here: this spells juiciness and easy, thirst-quenching joy. The palate gives a little backbone to all this pliable, soft fruit. An ideal, almost languid but very fresh summer wine."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Snoqualmie,10.0,89.0,"A fine Chardonnay for the price. Soft and buttery upon entry, it shows good balance in the midpalate, with the butter blended with fresh apple and lime, and set against enough juicy acidity to give it definition."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Washington,Washington Hills,10.0,89.0,"Very young, juicy, loaded with boysenberry and black cherry fruit. There is a strong streak of licorice, hints of tobacco and vanilla, but plenty of muscle and stiff tannins. A substantial effort, this ranks at the top of the list of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon priced under $10."
Rosé,France,Bordeaux,Château Les Hauts de Palette,10.0,89.0,"Lightly tannic and packed with raspberry flavors, this delicious wine has just the right balance between the ripe fruits and bright acidity. The wine is totally ready to drink."
Sémillon,France,Bordeaux,Château Haut Guillebot,10.0,89.0,"This ripe wine is full of tropical and citrus fruits, with some extra weight from the hint of wood. Fine and balanced, it reveals the smooth richness of 100% Sémillon."
Tămâioasă Românească,Romania,Dealu Mare,Budureasca,10.0,89.0,"Acacia flower, fragrant white flowers and white peach juice are present in the delicate bouquet of this wine made from the lesser known Tamaioasa Romaneasca grape. There is a pleasant fruit finish with flavors of apple, pear, peach and apricot."
Merlot-Grenache,France,France Other,Bourgeois Family,10.0,89.0,"It's an unusual blend, but it works, creating a round, supple wine for immediate enjoyment. Hints of orange peel, coriander and green olive bring complexity to notes of plum and cherry, while the finish turns dark and espresso-like."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Quinta do Portal,10.0,89.0,A spice note meshes with the tannins and black currant acidity in this elegant wine. The fruit is bright and juicy; the tannins still firm and will likely always lend an edge of severity. Age for 2–3 years.
Chardonnay,US,California,Surf Swim,10.0,89.0,"Tasty touches of toasted oak, butter and almonds in the aroma and again in the flavor add depth to the ripe Anjou pear notes in this full-bodied, posh-textured wine. With all that flavor, it keeps its balance and has a lingering finish, too."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Casa Santos Lima,10.0,89.0,"Big, bold and fruity, this dense wine has rich, red berry fruits and firm tannins its the core. While ripe and fruity, there is a hint of salty sea spray from a cool maritime influence. Drink now."
Syrah,US,Washington,StoneCap,10.0,89.0,"Direct and easy drinking, this is full of ripe blueberry aromas and flavors, framed by hints of toast and a dusting of cinnamon. Drink now."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Bulgaria,Thracian Valley,Bulgariana,10.0,89.0,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is garnet colored with a violet rim. It has aromas of pomegranate, dried black cherry and freshly ground black pepper. It's well structured, with fine tannins and flavors of ripe cherry, tart cranberry and juicy pomegranate."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Nein Lives,10.0,89.0,"Spice and smoke tones on the nose are a surprising contrast to the juicy white peach and yellow cherry flavors on the palate of this easy quaffing but surprisingly elegant wine. Off dry in style, with brisk acidity and a delicate profile, it's a versatile, widely appealing wine that's a spectacular bargain."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Monteiro,10.0,89.0,"This is an elegant wine, with balanced fruit and tannins that make for a soft texture. It is rich and laced with fresh, raspberry-like acidity. It can age for another year, but it is also ready to drink."
Red Blend,Australia,South Australia,Marlargo,10.0,89.0,"This unlikely blend of 87% Shiraz and 13% Petit Verdot hits the right notes for a bargain sipper, boasting plenty of weight and an interesting juxtaposition of raspberry fruit with dark chocolate. Earthy notes provide depth, and the finish is surprisingly silky for a wine in this price range. Drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Global Wines,10.0,89.0,"With six months in wood, this wine shows a strongly spicy character that gives a toast taste. The fruit is still developing, although it shows promise with its rich tannins and black-currant flavors. Wait until 2018 before drinking to let it live up to its potential."
Merlot,US,California,Montevina,10.0,89.0,"Lots of dark-fruit flavor, an ultrasmooth texture and a lingering finish raise this medium-bodied and value-priced wine well above average. Black cherry and blackcurrant flavors are sprinkled with spices recalling nutmeg and cardamom."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Western Cape,Spier,10.0,89.0,"This highly aromatic wine starts off with bright aromas of white flowers, fynbos, pink apples and white peaches. The lightweight palate offers clean flavors of peach and melon, with zippy acidity and a brisk finish. It's super tasty and easy to like, so enjoy now."
Rosé,Austria,Niederösterreich,Unger,10.0,89.0,"This restrained, salmon-tinged rosé teases with riper fruit, even with a red-berry compote of red currant and strawberry. The plump fruit is held in a dry frame and tempered by freshness. Equally tempting with or without food."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Vinho Verde,Casa de Vilacetinho,10.0,89.0,"For a Vinho Verde, this is rich and full-bodied, showing delicious acidity, crisp apples and a touch of tropical fruit. There's the typical prickle on the tongue that brings out freshness, but in fact this wine could age for a year."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Lisboa,Parras Vinhos,10.0,89.0,"The red wine is rich, dense and packed with fruit and tannins. It comes from the heart of the Lisboa region, giving plenty of structure from the cool-climate vineyards. There are fine red-fruit flavors shot through by juicy acidity. The wine has a drier, still developing tannic aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Fetzer,10.0,89.0,"This is a medium-bodied, crisp and tangy wine with fresh parsley aromas and lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. It's well balanced, restrained and will be very versatile with food."
Melon,France,Loire Valley,Château du Coing de Saint-Fiacre,10.0,89.0,"A wine from a selected parcel of vines; attractive, crisply balanced, the fresh green fruits backed by yeasty toast and a creamy, full texture. There is also a layer of minerality that turns this into a fine food wine."
Rosé,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château de Fountgraves,10.0,89.0,"The chalky limestone soil of Pic St. Loup allows the fruit to shine without being overpowering, translating into lively aromas and flavors of fresh red berries, nectarine, banana and ripe pineapple chunks supported by nuances of talcum and sweet pea. The creamy texture and medium weight are somewhat surprising for this aesthetically light rosé, and with the lingering finish and well-balanced acidity."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Swartland,Riebeek Cellars,10.0,89.0,"Vibrant and expressive, this offers initial aromas of blackberry, cassis and boysenberry that are matched with spicy hints of licorice root, black pepepr and cigar-box spice. The palate is round and slightly creamy, but framed by medium tannins and a long, toasty finish."
Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,Robertson,Excelsior,10.0,89.0,"A fragrance of crushed violet adds interest to the jammy blackberry, plum and cherry fruit core of this wine. Hints of licorice root, bramble and peppery spice unfold on the creamy palate, with ripe yet gripping tannins that remain on the finish."
Riesling,US,Washington,Ryan Patrick,10.0,89.0,"Here's a perfect go-to, every day Riesling for warm weather. Pretty fruit flavors of peach and apple are laced with orange pekoe tea. Medium-bodied and mouthfilling, it's got excellent length and structure."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Alente,10.0,89.0,"An elegant wine that slides easily over the palate. Its red berry flavors have a firm edge that stiffens the initial softness. Its tannins and acidity make this a serious, food-friendly wine that could age."
Moscato,US,Washington,Washington Hills,10.0,89.0,"With the interest in Moscato at all-time highs, this lovely wine should find a lot of admirers. A delicate orange-blossom scent rolls into flavors of pink grapefruit, lemon rind and rose petal. The acids keep the sugars in proportion and the finish refreshing."
Muscat,Moldova,Moldova,Lion-Gri,10.0,89.0,"Aromas of honeysuckle and apricot lead the way to flavors of roasted almond, orange blossom and dried apricot in this golden-colored sweet Muscat wine from Moldova. There's a nice amount of acidity to prevent this wine from being cloying."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Castle Rock,10.0,89.0,"A flavor spectrum emphasizing grapefruit and kiwi makes this lively and original. Assertive aromas of grapefruit and new-mown grass leap out of the glass, then the flavors are vivid, tangy and lingering. A crisp texture and just enough richness in the body complete the package."
White Blend,Germany,Mosel,Karl Josef,10.0,89.0,"Buoyantly tropical, this fragrant Riesling and Müller-Thurgau blend bursts from the glass with sweet, succulent mango, pineapple and melon flavors. Off dry in style, it's concentrated and juicy yet elegantly structured. The finish is full of kick and liveliness. Drink now through 2017."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Züm,10.0,89.0,"Crushed mineral and waxy lanolin notes accent intense tangerine and quince flavors on this juicy off-dry Riesling. It's robust on the palate, yet elegant, with a rippling herbal flair."
Riesling,Germany,Pfalz,Blue Fish,10.0,89.0,"Cute packaging belies the surprising depth to this Riesling. It's remarkably balanced, with an array of mineral, floral and fruit dimensions. Juicy, with preserved peach flavors and zippy lemon acidity, it's a thirst-quenching, solid pick from the Pfalz."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,9.0,89.0,"This wine is immediate in its appeal with aromas of lime leaf, flowers and peach. It drinks off dry with a zing of acidity that beautifully frames the full-fruit flavors."
Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,9.0,89.0,"An eminently quaffable style of Gewürztraminer, this puts the fresh fruit flavors front and center, with floral highlights enriching the nose and the finish. Crisp and clean, it sings out for pad Thai."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Aveleda,9.0,89.0,"Almost cool in character, this crisp Douro comes from high-altitude vineyards. The grapes yield a fruity citrus- and pear-driven wine that's minerally, with just the right amount of acidity to push its freshness forward."
Muscat,Chile,Limarí Valley,Viña Tabalí,9.0,89.0,"An overachiever among dessert wines. It opens with ripe melon and sweet stone fruit aromas, but it's not overly challenging or heavy. The palate is thick but offers just-right acidity, which frames sweet, enjoyable orange, lychee and honey flavors. Rich yet bright; an extreme."
Viognier,Australia,South Australia,Oxford Landing,9.0,89.0,"This wine may not be quite as rich or expressive as the other Viogniers in the Yalumba stable, but it's still an attractive effort. Pineapple and apricot flavors pick up hints of gingery spice on the vibrant finish. Drink now."
Garnacha,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Ateca,9.0,89.0,"This wine is fresh as can be, with loads of friendly black-fruit aromas upfront. The palate is juicy and bright, not the least bit hard or tannic, with huge flavors of berry fruits, baking spices, chocolate and even some bacon. This delivers a lot for the price."
Garnacha,Spain,Northern Spain,Tres Ojos,9.0,89.0,"With a hint of rubber and asphalt, the bouquet on this value wine is generous and topped with blackberry and dark plum aromas. The palate is grabby, with clampy tannins and black-fruit flavors mixed with chocolate and spice. The earthy, lightly herbal finish with rubbery nuances is nice."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,9.0,89.0,"This is very fresh and nicely detailed, with just 13% alcohol allowing some of the more subtle Sauvignon Blanc flavors to show. Some of the oldest vines in the state—more than 35 years old—are a prime component. Melon, green apple, lime and grapefruit flavors all mingle; acids are just right and the balance could not be better for lighter seafood and poultry."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,9.0,89.0,"The aromas are vibrant, with notes of pear, honeysuckle and peach. The palate is full flavored, dry as promised, with a zing of tart acidity that stitches it all together. It's an outstanding value that shows a beautiful sense of balance."
Red Blend,US,California,Ancient Roots,9.0,89.0,"Ripe but not jammy fruit flavors and firm texture make this a stand-up wine, even if it weren't such a great value. It has classic dark berry and light herb aromas, deep, fruity flavors and a big but plush mouthfeel."
Rosé,Spain,Northern Spain,Marqués de Cáceres,9.0,89.0,"Ideal Spanish rosé in every way, from color to aromas to flavors to the price tag. The nose is inviting, with delicate, crisp fruit aromas. The feel is just right, propelled by bright acids. Tastes of raspberry and watermelon, while the finish is long and lightly spicy. What a quaffing rosado should be."
White Blend,US,Washington,Barnard Griffin,9.0,89.0,"An iconic wine for Barnard Griffin, this is blended with 16% Sémillon. Spicy, searingly tart (below 13% alcohol, high acid) and annotated with beeswax, lemon oil, hints of honey and tea. Fragrant and palate cleansing; this is a particularly fine oyster wine."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Jose Maria Vieira,9.0,89.0,"This wine is rich and rounded, with plenty of spice, ripe berry fruits and acidity to balance. As it develops, the wine will fill out and give satisfying richness. Drink from 2019."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Aveleda,9.0,89.0,The reserve version of this wine has extra richness and concentration. Solid tannins are filled out with ripe juicy blackberry fruits and perfumed acidity. The wine is concentrated and could age for a few more months. Drink from 2017.
Pinot Noir,US,California,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,8.0,89.0,"The 2015 vintage is a strong one for Woodbridge. Ripe fruit tones, bright acidity and lightly mouth-puckering tannins underpin red cherry, clove and blackberry flavors, while the texture is mouthfilling. It's a treat to find an inexpensive wine with such good backbone."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Borsao,8.0,89.0,"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy. The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Labrousse,8.0,89.0,"This perfumed wine is firm with tannins that gives a spicy character. It has a dry core, a juicy aftertaste and rich blackberry fruit that will certainly develop as it matures. Give it some time and drink from 2021."
Riesling,US,Washington,Washington Hills,8.0,89.0,"With its 10% alcohol, bright fruit and lush, round mouthfeel, this is more mainstream (and main meal) than the late harvest label would suggest.

A very fine effort from new StoneCap winemaker Kendall Mix."
Red Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Borsao,8.0,89.0,"Almost impossible to distinguish this nice and easy Garnacha from the winery's Monte Oton label (also rated 89). Open berry and jam aromas keep it together, while the saturated, sweet blackberry palate is living proof of Campo de Borja's sun and terroir. Ripe, deep and easy to enjoy."
Carmenère,Chile,Maipo Valley,De Martino,10.0,88.0,"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmenère with a vital streak."
White Blend,Italy,Veneto,Gini,10.0,88.0,"A fresh, crisp style of Soave, brimming with green plum and light acidity. It has concentration and a light touch in equal measure."

The texture has good grip and acidity so the wine will pair well with big proteins."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Peter Mertes,10.0,88.0,"Subtle minerality lends surprising elegance to this otherwise buoyantly fruity wine. Succulent, soft yellow peach and apricot flavors are brightened by streaks of lemony acidity on the midpalate. The finish is refreshingly brisk. Drink now through 2018."
Riesling,US,Washington,Pacific Rim,10.0,88.0,"A solid effort, in the mainstream style that you'll find on many restaurant-chain wine lists. Apricot jelly—not jam—flavors carry through all the way, with a clean, crisp, well-balanced finish. The residual sugar is just under 30 g/L."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,10.0,88.0,"Dusty dark-fruit aromas are lusty and full of oaky notes including sawdust and chocolate.

Negroamaro,Italy,Southern Italy,Tenute Girolamo,10.0,88.0,"Aromas feature underbrush, dark berry, tilled soil and allspice. The dense, straightforward palate delivers ripe blackberry, spicy blueberry, clove and black licorice alongside hearty tannins. It closes on a tobacco note."
Grüner Veltliner,Austria,Niederösterreich,Bründlmayer,10.0,88.0,"L&T stands for “leicht & trocken”—light and dry. This wine is true to its name. Yeast notes mingle with grapefruit zest on the still-closed nose. The palate refreshes with crisp green apple and freshly sqeezed lemon. An almost austere wine, it has backbone, verve and lasting freshness."
Pinot Gris,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,10.0,88.0,Pinot Gris has been making inroads in Washington of late and this producer has been leading the way. Pleasing aromas of apple and melon lead to dry full-feeling fruit flavors that linger on the finish.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,DFJ Vinhos,10.0,88.0,"This wine heads the range of good value wines under the Monte Alentejano name. It has some weight and a tangy, structured character, and has not lost its black-plum flavors. Drink now."

Verdejo,Spain,Northern Spain,Vicente Gandia,10.0,88.0,"Stony, minerally aromas are a touch dusty and suggest melon and peach. The palate is round and juicy, while flavors of lime, green melon and gooseberry finish mellow and easy, with a touch of residual citric acid."
Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Northern Spain,Bodegas Valdemar,10.0,88.0,"Raisin, kirsch and leather aromas define the nose on this crianza. The palate is properly dry, with good acidity and clampy tannins. Flavors of dry oak, herbal notes, raspberry and raisin end in a solid but slightly rough finish. This will go better with food than on its own."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,10.0,88.0,"This is a ripe, smooth blend of Alvarinho and Chardonnay. The two complement each other well with yellow fruits touched by a more citrus edge and a rich character. It is fruity, full-bodied and ready to drink."

Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Oak Knoll,10.0,88.0,"Unoaked Chardonnays can be fairly neutral, but this one is anything but. Creamy and textural, it's laced with mixed flavors of grapefruit, gooseberry, lime and lemon zest. Delicious on its own, or pair it with gently seasoned seafood or poultry."

Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,10.0,88.0,"Cherry, plum, bacon and licorice are all good aromas that indicate that this value wine has quality backing it up. The palate is fresh and clean, with depth and ripe, slightly oaked flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. Easy to like, with toasty touches throughout."
Chardonnay,US,Oregon,Bridgeview,10.0,88.0,"About 40% is  barrel aged and put through malolactic. This is a heavier, more substantial effort than their regular Chardonnay, with more butterscotch flavors showing. With good fruit, some weight and texture, it's well made and a good value."

Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,Marlborough,Zeal,10.0,88.0,"This is a bit more punchy and pungent than Zeal's Reserve bottling, but it still offers considerable value.

Touriga Franca,Portugal,Douro,Messias,10.0,88.0,"This wine is flavorful, with plenty of blackberry fruit, as well as a dense, tannic heart. The fruit's edges are smoothed by the wood aging, but it is still fruit that dominates, ripe, hearty and packed with acidity to finish."

Rhône-style White Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Famille Perrin,10.0,88.0,"The Perrin family continues to turn out remarkable wines at every price level, including this $10 white blend of Grenache Blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier.

It's substantial and weighty without being fat or rich—just a nice drink."
Bonarda,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Tilia,10.0,88.0,"Forward, fruity aromas of black cherry, raspberry and cassis set up a high-acid palate that's energetic. Lightly herbal, rooty flavors of black cherry and blackberry linger on a juicy, clean finish."

Tempranillo,Spain,Northern Spain,Condado de Oriza,10.0,88.0,"Here's a highly recommended, everyday Ribera del Duero wine that starts with a full, round nose of charcoal, wild berry patch and oak. The oak, however, is tame (just three months of barrel time for this youngster) not forced, thus the cherry and raspberry fruit has vibrancy and balance."
Merlot,US,California,Fetzer,10.0,88.0,"Sweet oak aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a firm texture make a complete and enjoyable package in this full-bodied wine. It has a toasted oak flavor, tasty plum and cinnamon nuances, good acidity and supportive tannins."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Caves Aliança,10.0,88.0,"A wine with great juicy swathes of fruit that combine well with the natural structure of the Dão. It is textured and firmly tannic, with delicious black fruits coming through. It's ready to drink, but will certainly benefit from 1–2 years' aging."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,McManis,10.0,88.0,"Nervy, herbal aromas and vivid grapefruit alongside lemon flavors make this wine stand out from the pack. It is light to medium in body and has a crisp, tangy texture and refreshing finish."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Schmitt Söhne,10.0,88.0,"The nose on this easygoing Riesling is a bit reserved, suggesting hints of stone and bramble. It's quite vibrant on the palate though, offering loads of sweet-tart apple and pear flavors bolstered by zesty tangerine acidity. The finish wraps up brisk and clean."

Riesling,US,Idaho,Ste. Chapelle,10.0,88.0,"Lovely natural acidity keeps this sweet wine light on its feet, underscoring the honeyed pear fruit flavors with grapefruit and a hint of minerality. For a wine in this price range, with 11,000 case production levels, it's a marvelous achievement."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,10.0,88.0,"With residual sugar measuring 17 g/L, this puts the emphasis on fruit flavors that are forward, round, ripe and slightly sweet. It's right down the heart of the plate in terms of Washington styles; apple and peach the main flavors."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Pomelo,10.0,88.0,"This is a large-production Sauvignon Blanc that tastes delicious. If you like grapefruit and pomelo flavors, you will love this enticingly priced white that's got razor sharp acidity, a touch of New Zealand-like grass and a long finish."
Chardonnay,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal,10.0,88.0,"A wine made in memory of Catherine (Caterina) of Bragança, a Portuguese princess who married Charles II of England in the 17th century. It is a superripe wine, full of tropical fruit flavors and only the lightest of acidity. Wood aging gives the wine a plush character and suggests it could age for another year. Drink from 2016."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,Idaho,Ste. Chapelle,10.0,88.0,"Okay, Idaho Cabernet is never going to be an easy sell. But new winemaker Chuck Devlin is a talent, and he gives this wine a distinct core of sweet black cherry fruit; not big, but perfectly ripe. It's set in a slightly earthy framework of root and rock, with a lightly chalky finish. —P.G."
Riesling,US,Washington,Seven Hills,10.0,88.0,"Fragrant, with scents and flavors of pears and orange blossoms. This wine has 1.8% residual sugar, which qualifies it as off-dry, but it is still quite suitable for a wide range of foods, especially spicy Asian dishes. Full, fleshy and well-made, it delivers plenty of fresh fruit flavor with enough spice and acid to give a lift to the finish."
Merlot,US,California,Alias,10.0,88.0,"This attractive and medium-bodied wine smells a bit like ginger cookies. It tastes nicely dry, fruity and well structured with tannins and acidity. Nutmeg and ginger notes add extra interest to black cherry and pomegranate flavors."

Riesling,US,Washington,Barnard Griffin,10.0,88.0,"Spice, apple, light peach and a gentle fruitiness characterize this Riesling. There are deeper notes as well, skin phenolics that add texture and earthiness. But fruit is front and center, with crisp acidity right behind it."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Magnum Vinhos,10.0,88.0,"This is a dense wine with firm tannins and a solid structure. The black currant fruits are stalky and still developing, along with the acidity. It's a lean wine and needs to age for a few more months to fill out, so drink from 2017."

Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler,10.0,88.0,"A hint of green-floral perfume wafts amidst notes of honey and apple on this off-dry Riesling. Spine-tingling with acidity, it's balanced with sweet yellow peach and cherry flavors. Irresistibly easy drinking, it finishes moderately long."
Chardonnay,US,California,McManis,10.0,88.0,"This light-bodied Chardonnay makes a nice break from rich, heavy, oaky versions. Aromas of dried thyme and parsley lead to pleasing fruit flavors of pear and peach. It has enough texture to fill the mouth and enough crispness to stay clean on the finish."
Arinto,Portugal,Bucelas,Caves Velhas,10.0,88.0,"The Arinto grape and the town of Bucelas go together. This small enclave in the larger Lisboa region produces this crisp fruity style, like a southern version of dry Vinho Verde but with extra weight. Drink this attractive, lemon and red-apple flavored wine now."
Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Terres Douces,10.0,88.0,"This is a crisp wine, full of acidity. It holds the potential of crisp green and citrus fruits that are developing. A nutty edge contrasts with the tense acidity. Drink from late 2017."
Chardonnay,Australia,New South Wales,McGuigan,10.0,88.0,"A smooth, easy-drinking Chardonnay, with mild, understated aromas of green apple and toast, but also sweet tropical fruit flavors and a ripe pineapple-citrus finish that picks up hints of oranges. Best Buy."
Chardonnay,US,Washington,Covey Run,10.0,88.0,This wine sports a green-apple and pear nose with some extra weight from barrel fermentation. Well-balanced and right on the border between stainless- steel and barrel-fermented styles: steel meets butter on the palate. Best Buy.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Companhia das Quintas,10.0,88.0,"From vines in the upper Douro valley, this is an intense wine that's still young. Its smooth, ripe black cherry fruits are followed by blueberry, spice from wood and bitter chocolate. This is a complex wine that finishes fresh."
Castelão,Portugal,Península de Setúbal,DFJ Vinhos,10.0,88.0,"This wine has weight and considerable richness. Spice and an attractive perfume meld with the blackberry fruits and juicy acidity. The Castelão grape is at home in this region, which shows in the sense of terroir in this bold wine. Drink now."
Cabernet Franc,France,Loire Valley,Paul Buisse,10.0,88.0,"A wood-aged, rich and full wine, benefiting from the year and giving out fine perfumes, rich tannins and dark berry flavors. It's a wine with enough power to age further, already a solid pleasure to drink."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Duorum,10.0,88.0,"Herbaceous and richly crisp, its acidity is tangy with mineral undertones and bright green- and white-fruit flavors. This is delicious and fruity, with a great final zing."
Sauvignon Blanc,South Africa,Western Cape,Douglas Green,10.0,88.0,"Vibrant, tart aromas of green gooseberries and lime rind elevate the underlying hay and fresh thyme herbal accents. Lean, barely ripe white peach and hard pear add volume to the medium-weight mouth. Balanced and seamless with a clean, refreshing finish. Drink up!"
Syrah,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Trapiche,10.0,88.0,"Char, sawdust and black cherry aromas confirm the wine's “oak cask” labeling. Full bodied and ripe, it conveys meaty thickness and bold flavors of berry and spiced plum. A toasty, charred finish is lifted by bright acidity and fresh black-fruit flavors. This will go well with just about anything off the grill."
Riesling,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,10.0,88.0,"Labeled dry, this nonetheless carries a hint of sweetness, at 70 g/L residual sugar.  It's fruity and fresh, with melon, citrus and peach prominent. A perfect summer sipping wine."
Merlot,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Andeluna,10.0,88.0,"Hot and crusty smelling at first blush and then the nose turns to mocha and smoky berry. Good mouthfeel, rich and balanced, with a fresh quality as well. Solid, complete red wine with a nice berry-packed Merlot character."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Heinz Eifel,10.0,88.0,"Slicks of preserved peach and apple marmalade juxtapose vivacious lime and lemon in this juicy, off-dry Riesling. It's a satisfyingly fruity, pert wine finishing crisp and clean. Drink now through 2018."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,Schmitt Söhne,10.0,88.0,"A cool, alpine streak runs through this easygoing but refreshing Riesling, revealed through greenish glimmers of pine frond and fresh herb. Off dry in style, it calibrates sweet-tart green plum and apple notes against streaks of lime and lemon. Drink now."
Viura,Spain,Northern Spain,El Coto,10.0,88.0,"Good, clean and pleasant. The nose has pure apple and pear aromas along with a hint of vanilla and powdered sugar. It's fresh in the mouth, with lively apple, white peach and green banana flavors. Closes well and stays zesty and true from start to finish."
Moscato,Israel,Galilee,Golan Heights Winery,10.0,88.0,"A formidable rival to Moscato notoriously produced in Italy, this soft sparkler is sure to please. Rose petals, sweet lychee and peach purée draw you into the creamy yet effervescent texture. The long, juicy finish ends clean and satisfying."
Red Blend,US,California,Magistrate,10.0,88.0,"Black plum, slate, black rocks, red cherry and a touch of sandalwood show on the nose of this red blend that offers decent quality for the price. Pepper and pencil lead combine for a vibrant palate that's grippy in structure and lively in acidity."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Arbor Crest,10.0,88.0,"Redolent of intense grapefruit and pineapple, this is a classy, fruit-driven single-vineyard Sauvignon Blanc. Although this is aged entirely in stainless steel, there is a hint of cracker on the finish."
Red Blend,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Bradgate,10.0,88.0,"Soft, savory aromas of smoked meat and pepper typify this poised red from Stellenbosch. The elegant, integrated style marries spicy fruit and minerals in a gentle but ageable package. Food friendly because of its acid balance, the wine will be excellent with everything from duck breast to filet mignon."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Beringer,10.0,88.0,"Full bodied and rounded in texture, this wine has lots of ripe fruit and good balance, without the herbal character typical of Sauvignon Blanc. Mild melon and apple aromas lead to rich melon and fig flavors and a generous, mouthcoating texture. A great value."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Finca El Origen,10.0,88.0,"Raspberry and plum aromas include notes of brown sugar and warm pavement. A dense, chewy palate is packed with fruit and tannins. Flavors of minty oak and berry fruits dissolve into a heap of tannin and oak on the finish."
Merlot,US,Washington,Washington Hills,10.0,88.0,"Juicy, bright, loaded with young, grapey, berry flavors. Bright and polished, with a Grenache-like character, though it is 100% varietal."
Red Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Finca Hispana,10.0,88.0,"Jammy, gritty berry aromas set up a rubbery, full-force palate that doesn't tread lightly. Roasted, almost burnt black-fruit flavors finish firm. Overall, this feels right, while the flavors run a touch baked, rustic and stalky."
Merlot,US,Idaho,Ste. Chapelle,10.0,88.0,"Fairly tannic, this Merlot has some ripe, even sweet, cherry fruit. It's done in a light style, but it feels and tastes ripe, which means the winemaker knew what he was doing. A lovely effort that takes full advantage of the character of the region's fruit. —P.G."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,Delaforce,10.0,88.0,"This is the best vintage of Delaforce table wine so far. It has weight, density, great red fruits and a final freshness. A ripe wine, with some spice and hints of wood aging, it is ready to drink but can be enjoyed until 2020."

Red Blend,France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château Cabezac,10.0,88.0,"There's no shortage of spice in this value Minervois, with strong notes of pepper and garrigue herbs backed by notes of orange rind, red cherry and young raspberry. Medium-light in the mouth with moderate acidity and soft tannins; drink up now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Douro,DFJ Vinhos,10.0,88.0,"This structured, dense and smoky wine features dry tannins and a mineral texture. It has blackberry fruitiness to go with this scaffolding, so it will develop well to give a ripe, full, rich wine. Wait until 2015."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Dibon,10.0,88.0,"Dibon is new to us, and after tasting this complete, well-made Cava we are happy to make its acquaintance. The nose offers regal yeast and richness, while the palate has complexity to prop up apple, citrus and grapefruit flavors. Solid from front to back, with health and freshness."
Red Blend,US,California,Alias,10.0,88.0,"Oodles of blackberry and ripe grape flavors characterize this smoothly textured, well-balanced red blend. Firm elements of tannin and acidity support the ripeness, and the wine tastes fresh and mouth-watering. This will be great with meat, pasta and cheese."
Vernaccia,Italy,Tuscany,Il Palagione,10.0,88.0,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this appealing white offers aromas of fragrant white flower and ripe orchard fruit. The savory succulent palate delivers white peach, citrus, honeydew melon and a mineral note. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while a hint of bitter almond adds depth. It's an incredible value."
Merlot,US,California,One Leaf,10.0,88.0,"Grenadine and flavors of red cherry provide a brightness to this wine that is otherwise characterized by juicy texture and mild-mannered use of oak. Enjoyable and soft, it's priced well and is worth stocking up on for everyday meals."
Cabernet Sauvignon,US,California,Dark Horse,10.0,88.0,"Bold flavors and a muscular structure make this wine stand out, delivering plenty of substance for its modest price. Smoky, peppery aromas lead to dark fruit flavors with smoky, spicy accents, while the body is medium and texture firmly tannic."
Riesling,US,Washington,Maryhill,10.0,88.0,"Sourced entirely from the Milbrandt vineyards, this is a riot of honey, tea and mint highlights, with excellent acidity and ripe tree fruits. The length and density are outstanding for this price point."
Alvarinho-Chardonnay,Portugal,Lisboa,DFJ Vinhos,10.0,88.0,"An intriguing blend of grapes, bringing ripe, smooth Chardonnay up against crisp, green Alvarinho. It will work, once the wine has settled down and integrated. It's fresh, with crisp citrus and ripe apricot flavors, all shot through by acidity. Drink from 2016."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château de Costis,10.0,88.0,"Ripe and fruity, this is a wine that will develop quickly. With black currant and red-berry fruits it is perfumed, crisp as well as allowing plenty of room for juicy acidity. The tannins are firm and well balanced. Drink from 2017."
Agiorgitiko,Greece,Peloponnese,Lafazanis,10.0,88.0,"This is an Agiorgitiko that starts with aromas of clove, vanilla, cinnamon and mint. On the palate, appealing, deep flavors of tobacco, savory spice, smoked meat and cherry are balanced by an elegant acidity. This is a wine that can age but today, it's drinking well. Pair with lamb, pork."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Lagarde,10.0,88.0,"With a nice opening of plum, black cherry, floral notes and mocha, this captures the essence of quality Mendoza Malbec. The palate is generous and round, if a bit warm, and the flavors of blackberry, prune, spice and coffee are what we want from this type of wine. Drink throughout the winter and into 2010."
Black Muscat,US,Washington,Hyatt,10.0,88.0,"Labeled off dry but with little or no sweetness, this is a unique effort, a rosé style with unusual length and focus. Chill this wine and drink it as an apéritif. It is most unusual—dusty, musky, and concentrated, with a fine finish that resonates with a Grand Marnier note."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Terras de Alter,10.0,88.0,"A youthful wine that is just packed with fruit. It is a blend of Trincadeira, Aragonez and Syrah. Juicy, ripe and rich with black plum flavors, it is a delicious wine already. Drink now."
White Blend,US,Washington,14 Hands,10.0,88.0,"No specific blend is listed on this delicious wine—in the past it's been Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Sémillon. Luscious, ripe fruit flavors of grapefruit, melon and loads of fresh pear combine to show a wonderfully fresh and tasty white wine. The acids lift up the brightness, and this round and fruity style is a can't miss proposition."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château La Roche Bazin,10.0,88.0,"A wine that is well balanced with attractive ripe berry fruits and generous tannins. It has weight and richness, allowing room for the development of both the structure and the fruits. Drink from 2017."
Rhône-style Red Blend,France,Rhône Valley,Père Anselme,10.0,88.0,"This is attractive in a bright, fruit-driven style. Bright berry fruit is tinged with apricot and cocoa on the midpalate, then finishes firm and dusty."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Gaucho Club,10.0,88.0,"Despite the concept-driven name, this is good Malbec at a good price. Minty black-fruit aromas are welcoming and stand up to scrutiny. The palate has juicy acidity and purity to support plum and cherry flavors that are spicy and dry in nature. For basic Malbec, you won't do much better than this."
Garnacha,Spain,Northern Spain,Cruz de Piedra,10.0,88.0,"For $10 this is a serious, powerful Garnacha with concentration and purity. The palate feels both crisp and lifted as well as dense and concentrated. There's quality to the flavor profile, which offers rubbery, dense blueberry along with blackberry. Rarely does a value-priced wine show this much weight and texture."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Caves Aliança,10.0,88.0,"A smooth ripe wine, full of red fruits and bold kaleidoscope flavors. It has acidity, plenty of spice and a generous feel that comes from the oak aging and superrich fruits. Drink now."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château l'Espérance,10.0,88.0,This ripe and spicy wine has fine tannins and smoky wood flavors that balance its rich black fruit. That indicates it will age well—rich in both structure and fruit. Drink from 2020.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Herdade de São Miguel,10.0,88.0,"A finely structured, still young wine with an edge of austerity. It does have a rich core of red fruit, giving a slightly juicy character, but with its tannins it will always be a firm wine, dense and serious."
Pinot Noir,US,California,Belle Ambiance,10.0,88.0,"A lively, oak-spice aroma leads into bright red fruits and cinnamon tones on the palate. A smooth but lively texture completes the picture for this medium-bodied wine."
Chardonnay,US,California,Belle Ambiance,10.0,88.0,"This is not an attention-getter, but a mild-mannered, reasonably balanced wine that will happily pair with dishes ranging from seafood to roast chicken. It has faint apple and vanilla aromas, mild apple and lemon flavors, and a lingering, lightly spicy finish."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Clos du Lac,10.0,88.0,"Thirst-quenching, lean and tangy, it would make a good match with shucked oysters. It shows lemon and green apple aromas, plus fresh and crisp citrus flavors. Medium in body, the texture is pleasantly lean while the finish is refreshing."
Pinot Gris,US,Oregon,Montinore,10.0,88.0,"Melon and citrus aromas get this soft, ripe and round wine going. The palate is full and plump, with bold citrus and tropical flavors and a welcome textural creaminess. The finish is smooth and supple, and as a whole this wine covers all the bases while showing itself to be a more than capable food accompaniment."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,DFJ Vinhos,10.0,88.0,"Almost black in color, this densely tannic wine is granular, dusty and mineral in character. The berry fruits shoulder the weight of the tannins easily, giving a ripe wine that will need until 2016 to develop fully"
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Argento,10.0,88.0,"Nicely done and not the least bit difficult or complicated. The nose is full of bold black fruit and balsam wood, while the palate is full and stocky, but balanced. Flavors of berry and cherry are forward and sticky rich, while the finish is long and shows just enough acidity to keep things focused."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Casteller,10.0,88.0,"Crisp and nice Cava with good balance, clean apple, dusty spices and pithy lemon. Fold it all together on the nose, palate and finish and you wind up with a well-made, attractive, easy-to-sip bubbly with some polish. Textbook everyday Cava."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Ribatejano,Quinta do Casal Branco,10.0,88.0,"A perfumed, juicy wine with delicious red fruits and well adjusted with acidity. There are good, dry tannins as well, suggesting this will make a good food wine. The aftertaste has chewy structure and acidity."
White Blend,US,New York,Fulkerson,10.0,88.0,"This delicately spritzy bottling of Diamond, a Concord grape hybrid, offers all the juicy, grapy deliciousness of Concord with twists of tropical and citrus fruit flavors. Moderately sweet and light in alcohol, it's straightforward, fun and guzzle worthy."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Stellenbosch,Winery of Good Hope,10.0,88.0,"Pretty, balanced and elegant, this wine offers varietally correct aromas and flavors of citrus, melon and apple, all buoyed by a crisp minerality that offers lift. Also true to the style, there's a round sweetness here that gives the wine an opulent edge. Pair with a chicken salad or seafood."
Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,Central Valley,Misiones de Rengo,10.0,88.0,"Round, ripe and pure, with olive, blackberry and a dusting of herbs. For the money this is a satisfying Cabernet with a firm but solid mouthfeel and flavors of cola, berry syrup and cassis. Creamy and semisweet on the finish, but not cloying or candied. Well made and a good value."
Sauvignon Blanc,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Quintay,10.0,88.0,"Although it's standard in many ways, sometimes regularity done right works. In this case, the wine brings tropical aromas along with saline and green herbs. In the mouth, it's fresh and briney, with tropical fruit, citrus and green notes. Tangy and pure; nice for the price."
Chardonnay,Australia,New South Wales,Reynolds,10.0,88.0,"These grapes are sourced from the relatively cooler region of Orange, and it shows in the wine's pear and citrus flavors. Hints of nuts (cashews, perhaps?) add complexity and style not often found in this price range. Crisp and clean on the finish, with refreshing citrus notes."
Zinfandel,US,California,Minassian-Young,10.0,88.0,"Bright boysenberry and black-cherry scents are seasoned with clove and nutmeg, and enhanced with gravel and rose-bud aromas. The palate is spicy and juicy, with boisterous black pepper, plum, blueberry and tobacco flavors."
Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Hogue,10.0,88.0,"This wine is still settling in, with tiny bubbles coating the glass. The aromas of spice, flowers and lychee are vibrant and the palate drinks dry, showing plenty of richness and intensity."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Douro,Duorum,10.0,88.0,"It is probably the small soupçon of Moscatel in the blend that gives this wine its irresistible perfumed character. That just brings out the fine acidity and the crisp citrus flavors. It is a refreshing wine, as aromatic at the end as at the beginning. Drink now."
White Blend,Germany,Mosel,Karl Josef,10.0,88.0,"Enticing, with notes of candle wax, spice and zesty lemon, this off-dry blend of Müller-Thurgau and Riesling is deeply concentrated with white peach and apricot flavors. It's weighty and rich in feel, with streaks of mineral that add delicate complexity to the finish."
White Blend,US,Oregon,Oak Knoll,10.0,88.0,"This delightful, off-dry white is a blend of Pinot Gris, Gewürztraminer, Müller Thurgau, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling,  perfectly matched to deliver crisp, fruity aromatics and flavors of apples, oranges and pears. It's a terrific anytime quaffer."
Sauvignon Blanc,South Africa,Western Cape,Nederburg,10.0,88.0,"A light, sophisticated nose of white flowers and citrus is followed by balanced fresh fruit and acid. The wine has a light touch but impresses with its elegant overall character. Pair with grilled fish or salads. A wine with poise and class."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,Wines & Winemakers,10.0,88.0,"The wine has blackberry fruits that give attractive acidity and add to the light structure. It is fruity, juicy and ready to drink."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejo,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz,10.0,88.0,"Initially tannic, this concentrated wine shows itself to be young, with its structure still waiting to open. A dry texture lies over the big berry flavors that will develop over the next year."
White Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Parxet,10.0,88.0,"Floral and fresh, with a supercharged personality and plenty of sugary sweetness. On the plus side, it's racy and lithe, and that's despite being as candied as it is. But ask yourself, what's not to like about lemon-lime and apple? And when there's smoothness and palate feel thrown in, you wind up with a warm-weather winner."
Gewürztraminer,France,Alsace,Michel Léon,10.0,88.0,The wine balances the sweet spiciness of Gewurztraminer with a good level of acidity. That gives the wine a light touch while allowing the rose and bergamot character of the grape to shine through. The wine is ready to drink.
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,J. Portugal Ramos,10.0,88.0,"Showing the warmth of an Alentejo wine, this is ripe and full in the mouth, offering red berry fruits cut with juicy acidity. It's a rich wine tinged with spice, finishing with a fresh aftertaste."
Nerello Mascalese,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Murgo,10.0,88.0,"Made entirely with Nerello Mascalese, this offers aromas of scorched earth, ripe berry and clove. The lithe palate delivers juicy cherry, crushed raspberry, ground white pepper and a mineral note alongside polished tannins."
Chenin Blanc,South Africa,Swartland,Riebeek Cellars,10.0,88.0,"Floral tones of peony, honeysuckle and verbena are upfront on the nose of this pretty white wine, with core fruit tones of pink apple and sweet citrus. The palate is bright and clean, with easygoing fruit flavors and superb acidic lift that cumulates in an immensely refreshing close. Drink now."
Riesling,Germany,Mosel,St. Christopher,10.0,88.0,"While subdued on the nose, there's lots of lively lemon and tangerine flavor on the palate of this dainty Kabinett. It's zippy and spry but sharply penetrating with a lingering lime pith finish."
Rosé,Spain,Northern Spain,Rio Madre,10.0,88.0,"This fluorescent pink rosé is fairly full on the nose, with a grape skins character. Lively, balanced and lightly oily in feel, this delivers plum and citrus flavors prior to a finish that's pithy and tastes like ripe pink grapefruit."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Grand Marchand,10.0,88.0,"This dense and solid wine comes from the eastern ends of the Entre-deux-Mers. It is full of black fruits that balance the firm, dry tannins. Juicy acidity bursts in at the end for a wine that's already delicious and will age well. Best to drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Arnaucosse,10.0,88.0,"This structured wine has 25-year old vines as its basis. It is concentrated and dense as well as bringing out the ripe berry fruits that are typical of 2012. With the structure and acidity well in place, this wine will age. Drink from 2017."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Producta Vignobles,10.0,88.0,"This structured wine tastes young, showing considerable tannins at this stage. Its weight gives it potential, however, and the wine will show blackberry flavors and juicy acidity by 2017."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Bodega Furlotti,10.0,88.0,"Normally we're leery about new brands with catchy names, but this one does chart a new direction...and it's a good one. A little sweet and teetering on syrupy on the nose, this Malbec draws it back in the mouth and shows balanced black fruit flavors, thickness, saturation and length. Thoroughly modern in style."
Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Spain,Levante,Sequiot,10.0,88.0,"Smells like spiced fruit cake, prune and licorice. It's ripe and a touch syrupy, but genuine and not cloying or overly heavy. Tastes of baked plum and blackberry along with dark spices and chocolate. Chocolaty and coffee-tinged on the finish. 50% Tempranillo and 50% CS."
Pinot Grigio,US,California,Montevina,10.0,88.0,"Aromas like crisp green apples and flavors of ripe white peaches combine in this fresh-tasting and medium-bodied wine. The texture is lively but smooth around the edges, and the wine is very appetizing."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Snoqualmie,10.0,88.0,"Dramatically reduced production coupled with a fine vintage add up to a stellar Snoqualmie Sauvignon Blanc in 2009. Loaded with melon, citrus and apple fruit flavors, this brisk and refreshing wine is reminiscent of a racy Quincy. Perfect springtime sipper."
Shiraz,Israel,Israel,Hacormim,10.0,88.0,"Aromas of black cherry and dark chocolate prime the palate for flavors of black cherry, black plum, mocha, smoked meat and a hint of bell pepper. It is vibrant on entry, with a sense of brightness that stands out above firm but subtle tannins."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Vircoulon,10.0,88.0,Big tannins mask the fruit in this potentially ripe and fruity wine. It is structured and dark with a dry core of tannins. It means the wine needs time. Drink from 2019.
Loureiro,Portugal,Vinho Verde,J. Portugal Ramos,10.0,88.0,"This is a classic dry Vinho Verde. It has delicious fruit and crisp acidity giving lemon flavors, a lively texture and a refreshing aftertaste. Drink this wine now."
Portuguese White,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta da Alorna,10.0,88.0,"This wine is attractive, ripe and finely perfumed. With the spicy Moscatel flavors in the blend, it brings yellow fruit tones balanced by lively acidity. There is a great tangy character which yields a lifted, smooth aftertaste. Drink now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Casal Branco,10.0,88.0,"A blend of Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a soft and smooth wine. Red berry fruits are balanced by spice and tannins from a short time in oak. The wine is ready to drink, although waiting until late 2016 would make it even more enjoyable."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Airlie,10.0,88.0,"It's a little late to be releasing an '04, but this may actually be all the better for the extra bottle age. Richly scented with rose petal soap, chewing gum and lychee, it delivers concentrated, oily flavors with a sharply floral streak. It's bone dry and highly extracted, and tips the scale at 14.4% alcohol."
Chardonnay,Chile,Casablanca Valley,Viñedos Organicos Emiliana,10.0,88.0,"This is a fulfilling unoaked, organic wine from Chile's cool Casablanca Valley. This quaffable Chard focuses on pure citrus, grapefruit and peach flavors. There's a touch of natural sweetness but with no oak there's no butter, fat or flab. Breaks the mold and opens the door to a whole other style of Chardonnay."
Gewürztraminer,US,Oregon,Château Bianca,10.0,88.0,"Spicy and dry, this is done to a wickedly tart finish; the flavors are set up beautifully to accompany food. The floral and rose petal scents of the grape are nicely rendered but not overwhelming, and the 1% RS residual sugar is almost invisible given the juicy fruit and acids."
Rosé,France,Provence,Domaines Pierre Chavin,10.0,88.0,"Organically grown grapes give this wine a pure and fruity character that makes it instantly attractive. It is crisp, laced with lemon and lively, juicy red fruits. The aftertaste is dry and full of flavor."
Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Medrano,10.0,88.0,"Jammy raspberry aromas come with a minerally kick and toastiness. The palate is fresh and delivers pointed acidity in support of toasty berry, herb and licorice flavors. Finishes with a lightly baked and chocolaty note, confirming that this is well-made, value-priced wine."
Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,US,California,Ringer,10.0,88.0,"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah offers varietally blended aromas of black currant, charred hardwood and black pepper. It's very jammy and hedonistic on the palate, with hot blueberry pie and toasted vanilla-bean elements, yet the tannins and acidity hold the powerful flavors in check."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Estremadura,Quinta do Gradil,10.0,88.0,"Vinified by the winemaking team of Dão Sul, this is a blend of Touriga Nacional, Alicante Bouschet and Syrah, a rich, wild blend, with smooth blackberry jelly fruits, an edge of astringency, and a layer of toast from the eight months wood aging."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Terras do Dão,UDACA,10.0,88.0,"For a wine that is not a Dão appellation to be made by the cooperative union that under the old Fascist regime controlled all of Dão's wine production, this is possibly an irreverent wine. Otherwise it is a fine, accessible blend of all the Dão red grapes in a mélange that is full of blackberry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2017."
Chardonnay,Chile,Curicó Valley,Montes,10.0,88.0,"The nose is light and attractive, with peach and floral accents. The mouth is perfectly smooth, with apple, melon and a hint of flint or steel. On the finish, some cinnamon spice adds character to the baked-apple flavors. With no flaws, this is the epitome of affordable, drinkable Chardonnay. Best Buy."
Merlot,US,California,McManis,10.0,88.0,"This medium-bodied wine has bold aromas of black pepper, tobacco and clove that merge with straightforward cherry and herb flavors for a nicely complex profile. It has way more depth and interest than the price tag would suggest."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,Washington,Chateau Ste. Michelle,10.0,88.0,"The aromas are bright, with notes of guava, pineapple and citrus. The palate is lightly spritzy with plenty of grapefruit flavors that keep the interest high."
Riesling,Germany,Rheinhessen,Heinz Eifel,10.0,88.0,"While muted on the nose, this refreshing off-dry Riesling offers concentrated tangerine and yellow peach flavors. Light in body with a spry, zesty mouthfeel, it finishes brisk and clean. Enjoy now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Quinta do Cavalinho,10.0,88.0,"This attractive wine has a fine, dusty structure that balances well with the rich berry fruits. Sweet tannins and layers of acidity meld well. Ripe while also elegant, it needs a short period of aging. Drink from 2015."
Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Bogle,10.0,88.0,"Grapefruit aromas, bright kiwi and apple flavors and appetizing acidity make a lively, refreshing wine. This will be thirst-quenching on hot summer days and good with seafood, goat cheese and many other dishes any time of the year."
Carignan,Chile,Maule Valley,Mancura,10.0,88.0,"Hard spice, fresh-cut oak and dark berry aromas make for a serious, stout bouquet. This is bright and lively in the mouth, with mouthfilling tannins and flavors of boysenberry and vanilla. A quick, slightly hot finish is aggressive but sturdy."
Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,Bordeaux,Château Fontenelle,10.0,88.0,"A big, bold, fruity wine, this has great tannins, ripe black-currant fruit and an attractive sense of structure. It has all the juiciness and freshness of 2010, but is a wine for aging over 3–4 years."
Grillo,Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Stemmari,10.0,88.0,"Heady aromas suggesting tropical fruit, honeysuckle and citrus zest lead the nose. Bright and refreshing, the lively palate offers mature white stone fruit, tangerine peel and a pleasantly bitter-almond note."
Petite Sirah,US,California,Peltier,10.0,88.0,"This is a fruit bomb supreme.

Tempranillo,Spain,Central Spain,Condesa de Leganza,9.0,88.0,"The vast region of La Mancha is on the prowl in the 21st century, and wines like this won't hurt the region's improving reputation. The nose here is fresh and loaded with berry sweetness and accents of cinnamon and forest floor. The palate is round and chewy, with plum and berry flavors.

Malbec,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Origin,9.0,88.0,"This global brand has a hit in Mendoza.

Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Argentina,Mendoza Province,Nieto Senetiner,9.0,88.0,"A lot of different aromas are vying for attention; there's spearmint, potting soil, tobacco and black fruits.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Alentejano,DFJ Vinhos,9.0,88.0,"Paxis is a warm, earthy wine, packed with ripe, soft and forward fruit. It does have a structure that could allow the wine to age, but there is no need as its fruitiness makes it ready to drink now."

Johannisberg Riesling,US,Washington,Tagaris,8.0,88.0,"Tagaris makes two Rieslings, priced just a buck apart. The “Reserve” may be just a stitch tighter, with more creaminess in the mouth, less in-your-face fruit."

Tempranillo Blend,Spain,Central Spain,Volteo,8.0,88.0,"The under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum.

Portuguese Red,Portugal,Tejo,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo,8.0,88.0,"Open and fruity, this delicious, already drinkable wine is a typical Portuguese blend that's dominated by Touriga Nacional. It has an attractive perfumed aroma along with toasty wood flavors and black currant freshness. The combination is full, forward and delicious now."
Portuguese Red,Portugal,Dão,Caves Aliança,8.0,88.0,"This wine shows the characteristic granitic texture of the region. Berry fruits smother the firm tannins to give a rich, juicy wine that's bold, ripe, and ready to drink."

Sauvignon Blanc,US,California,Al,8.0,88.0,"Made by the team at Wrath, this is one of the better canned wines on the shelves right now. Light in the glass, it offers very refreshing, mineral-driven aromas of wet riverstone and rain on cement as well as slight touches of Pink Lady apples and green hay. Asian pear flesh mixes with slightly sour lime peel and sweet chives on the palate."
Chardonnay,US,California,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,8.0,88.0,"Woodbridge makes two styles of Chardonnay, and this is the richer one. Attractive layering of fruit, cream and hazelnut flavors on a nicely viscous texture makes this full-bodied wine something special. It has a good sense of concentration and depth, along with a lingering finish."
Red Blend,US,Washington,Hogue,8.0,88.0,"Light aromas of ash, herb, berry, vanilla and cherry lead to sweet plush cranberry and cherry flavors that linger along with baking spice notes on the finish. It brings a lot of enjoyment for the price."
Merlot,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,8.0,88.0,"It would be hard to find a better $8 Merlot anywhere. This is soft and full-bodied, quite flavorful and fruity, with pretty black cherry fruit. Drinking especially nicely with a bit of bottle age, it finishes with well-proportioned notes of tobacco and clove."
Gewürztraminer,US,Washington,Columbia Crest,8.0,88.0,"A very fine effort at a most affordable price, this off-dry Gewürztraminer nicely captures the powdery floral scents and peachy, lychee fruit notes of the grape. The bright acidity keeps it fresh and bracing."
Bical,Portugal,Bairrada,Global Wines,8.0,88.0,"With its intense acidity, refreshing citrus fruit and lime zest-like texture, this is a lively, bright and crisp wine. It's balanced with a firm backbone of acidity to keep everything brisk and delicious. Drink now."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Segura Viudas,10.0,87.33333333333333,"A lively number with kick and effervescence. The nose is kind, with light fruits and a whiff of chocolate. Plum and raspberry flavors are nice and accented by earthy spice, while the wine's texture and structure seem more than solid, given its everyday price. Raspberry and red-plum aromas are light and a touch smoky. On the palate this is fresh, juicy and driven by good acidity. Bright stone-fruit flavors blend with pie-cherry notes in front of a lasting, citrusy finish. Simple, light strawberry aromas form a good opening. The palate is juicy and bright, with citrus and nectarine flavors. There's nothing complicated or overreaching here; it's easygoing, clean and finishes with pepper and brown sugar."
Sparkling Blend,Spain,Catalonia,Segura Viudas,10.0,87.25,"White fruits and candied apple aromas turn a little dusty with airing. The palate is crisp and standard, with no issues and juicy flavors of lightly sweetened apple, nectarine and citrus. Clean on the finish. With aromatic touches of haystack and vanilla in addition to green apple and mineral, the nose is inviting. On the palate, it's nice and lemony, with green apple acids offering a modest scour. Cleansing and ideal with simple finger foods. Very nice for the price. Baked apple and spice aromas form a recognizable bouquet, while the palate oozes with grapefruit and tart apple flavors. This is zesty, clean, a little bit lean and fresh. It doesn't offer much in the way of range or complexity, but it's more than serviceable at the price point. Imported by Freixenet USA. This is as crisp and dry as a whispy reed, with a mild grassy note on the nose. It feels fresh and focused, with lime, peach and apple flavors. Fruity, fresh and easy to like from start to finish, this is what a Best Buy should be."
